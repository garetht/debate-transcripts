Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la dembi noras. se cu fo'o
(B) fo'o cu se dembi la noras.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) is the correct answer, let's first analyze both options and see how they differ in terms of grammar and meaning.
2. Option (A) reads: ""la dembi noras. se cu fo'o.""
3. This sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
4. The first part, ""la dembi noras,"" seems to be an attempt to name something, but it is not clear what it is trying to name.
5. The second part, ""se cu fo'o,"" is also problematic.
6. The ""se"" is a conversion operator, but it is not clear what it is trying to convert.
7. The ""cu"" is a separator, but it is not clear what it is separating.
8. Finally, ""fo'o"" is a pause indicator, but it is not clear why it is being used here.
9. Overall, this sentence is not well-formed and does not convey a clear meaning.
10. On the other hand, option (B) reads: ""fo'o cu se dembi la noras.""
11. This sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning.
12. The ""fo'o"" is a pause indicator, which is used here to separate the two parts of the sentence.
13. The ""cu"" is a separator, which is used to separate the verb ""se dembi"" from the object ""la noras.""
14. The ""se dembi"" is a converted verb, meaning ""to be a seed of.""
15. Finally, ""la noras"" is a name, which can be translated as ""Noras.""
16. So, the sentence can be translated as ""Noras is a seed of something.""
17. As you can see, option (B) is a well-formed, grammatically correct Lojban sentence with a clear meaning, while option (A) is not.
18. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) ""fo'o cu se dembi la noras.""

5. This follows the correct word order in Lojban.
6. On the other hand, in (B), ""ve"" comes before ""snada"", which is incorrect.
7. Additionally, ""lo"" is used before ""go'a"", which is unnecessary and also incorrect.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ki'o spoja cu mucti la'e la djan.
(B) mucti cu spoja djan. la ki'o la'e

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (B) because it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure.
2. In Lojban, the verb always comes before the subject, so ""mucti cu spoja"" is the correct order for ""spoja cu mucti"" in option (A).
3. Additionally, ""ki'o spoja"" is not a valid Lojban phrase, as ""ki'o"" is a cmavo (a word used for grammatical purposes) and cannot be used as a noun or verb.
4. On the other hand, option (B) follows the correct sentence structure and uses valid Lojban words.
5. ""Mucti"" means ""much"" or ""many,"" ""spoja"" means ""explode,"" and ""djan"" means ""John.""
6. The phrase ""la ki'o la'e"" is also valid, as ""la"" is used to indicate a name or a description of a person or thing.
7. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer and (A) is incorrect due to its incorrect sentence structure and use of invalid Lojban words.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le
(B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the two options and analyze their grammatical structures.
2. (A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le (B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka First, let's look at option (A).
3. In this sentence, ""panje"" is the verb, meaning ""to spread"" or ""to extend.""
4. ""Pu"" is a tense marker indicating past time, and ""xanka"" is the object being spread, which can be translated as ""nervousness"" or ""anxiety.""
5. The particle ""cu"" separates the verb from the following predicate, ""surla,"" which means ""to relax.""
6. Finally, ""loi le"" is a quantifier that can be translated as ""some of the.""
7. Now, let's analyze option (B).
8. In this sentence, ""le surla"" is a noun phrase meaning ""the relaxation.""
9. The particle ""cu"" separates the noun phrase from the verb ""panje,"" which, as mentioned earlier, means ""to spread"" or ""to extend.""
10. ""Pu"" is again a tense marker indicating past time, and ""loi xanka"" is a quantifier meaning ""some of the nervousness"" or ""some of the anxiety.""
11. Comparing the two options, it is clear that option (A) has a more logical and coherent structure.
12. In option (A), the sentence can be translated as ""The spreading of nervousness in the past relaxed some of the (people).""
13. This sentence makes sense and conveys a clear meaning.
14. On the other hand, option (B) can be translated as ""The relaxation spread some of the nervousness in the past.""
15. This sentence is not only awkward but also seems to convey a contradictory meaning, as relaxation and nervousness are generally considered opposites.
16. Therefore, based on the grammatical structure and the logical coherence of the sentences, I would argue that (A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le is the better answer, and (B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka is incorrect.

Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ku se ka vau kei stela le tunba steba
(B) le ka stela vau kei se steba ku tunba

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the structure of both sentences and analyze their grammatical components.
2. (A) ku se ka vau kei stela le tunba steba (B) le ka stela vau kei se steba ku tunba First, let's look at (A).
3. The structure of this sentence is as follows: - ""ku"" is a terminator that closes a previous construct, which is not present in this sentence, but it can be used for emphasis or clarity.
4. - ""se"" is a conversion operator that swaps the first and second places of the following predicate.
5. - ""ka"" is an abstractor that creates a property from the following predicate.
6. - ""vau"" is an end-of-sumti marker, which indicates the end of a noun phrase.
7. - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the abstraction started by ""ka"".
8. - ""stela"" is a predicate meaning ""to lock"" or ""to be a lock"".
9. - ""le"" is an article that refers to a specific instance of the following predicate.
10. - ""tunba"" is a predicate meaning ""sibling"".
11. - ""steba"" is a predicate meaning ""to be frustrated"" or ""to be angry"".
12. Now, let's analyze (B): - ""le"" is an article that refers to a specific instance of the following predicate.
13. - ""ka"" is an abstractor that creates a property from the following predicate.
14. - ""stela"" is a predicate meaning ""to lock"" or ""to be a lock"".
15. - ""vau"" is an end-of-sumti marker, which indicates the end of a noun phrase.
16. - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the abstraction started by ""ka"".
17. - ""se"" is a conversion operator that swaps the first and second places of the following predicate.
18. - ""steba"" is a predicate meaning ""to be frustrated"" or ""to be angry"".
19. - ""ku"" is a terminator that closes a previous construct, which is not present in this sentence, but it can be used for emphasis or clarity.
20. - ""tunba"" is a predicate meaning ""sibling"".
21. Now that we have analyzed both sentences, it is clear that (A) is the better answer.
22. The structure of (A) allows for a more coherent and logical interpretation, as it can be translated to something like ""The property of locking is frustrated by the sibling.""
23. In contrast, (B) has a less clear structure and meaning, as the conversion operator ""se"" is placed after the abstraction terminator ""kei"", which makes the sentence difficult to interpret.
24. Furthermore, the use of ""ku"" in (A) adds emphasis to the sentence, while its placement in (B) is less effective.
25. Overall, (A) is a more grammatically sound and meaningful sentence in Lojban, making it the better answer choice.

2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3.

4. The future tense marker ""ba"" is placed after the name ""Meris,"" which makes it unclear what action is happening in the future.
5. Additionally, the vocative marker ""doi"" is used to address someone, but it is not clear who is being addressed in this sentence.
6. (B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris.
7. This sentence can be broken down as follows: - mi'o: we (inclusive, meaning the speaker and the listener) - doi: vocative marker, used to address someone - jemna: to compete - ba: a future tense marker - meris: a name, in this case, ""Meris"" In this sentence, the structure is much clearer.

9. The future tense marker ""ba"" is placed before the name ""Meris,"" showing that the competition will happen in the future with Meris.
10. Therefore, (B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris is a better answer than (A) mi'o doi meris. ba jemna because it has a clearer structure and more accurately conveys the intended meaning.

3. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.

5. It translates to something like ""the curse is a phone of it"", which doesn't make much sense.
6. On the other hand, option (B) ""fo'i cu fonxa dapma le"" has a more logical structure.
7. In this case, ""fo'i"" is a pronoun that refers back to a previously mentioned object, ""cu"" is a separator that helps clarify the relationship between the subject and the verb, ""fonxa"" means ""phone"", ""dapma"" means ""curse"", and ""le"" is a definite article.

2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) le jmifa ca clupa tu is the better answer.
3. (A) jmifa clupa ca le tu In this sentence, the word order is incorrect.
4. In Lojban, the typical sentence structure follows the pattern: ""sumti selbri sumti"", where ""sumti"" are the arguments and ""selbri"" is the relation between them.
5. In this case, ""jmifa"" and ""clupa"" are both selbri, and ""ca"" and ""le tu"" are sumti.

9. This sentence translates to ""The small one is near you"", which is a valid and grammatical Lojban sentence.
10. Therefore, the better answer is (B) le jmifa ca clupa tu, as it follows the correct sentence structure and conveys a clear meaning.

Is Sentence 2 of the proposed solution correct or flawed?","The topic at issue is whether Sentence 2 of a proposed solution to a problem is correct or flawed. A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) jmifa clupa ca le tu
(B) le jmifa ca clupa tu

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) le jmifa ca clupa tu is the better answer.
3. (A) jmifa clupa ca le tu In this sentence, the word order is incorrect.
4. In Lojban, the typical sentence structure follows the pattern: ""sumti selbri sumti"", where ""sumti"" are the arguments and ""selbri"" is the relation between them.
5. In this case, ""jmifa"" and ""clupa"" are both selbri, and ""ca"" and ""le tu"" are sumti.
6. The correct structure should have a selbri between two sumti, but this sentence has two selbri next to each other, which is not grammatical in Lojban.
7. (B) le jmifa ca clupa tu This sentence follows the correct Lojban structure: ""sumti selbri sumti"".
8. ""Le jmifa"" is the first sumti, ""ca clupa"" is the selbri, and ""tu"" is the second sumti.
9. This sentence translates to ""The small one is near you"", which is a valid and grammatical Lojban sentence.
10. Therefore, the better answer is (B) le jmifa ca clupa tu, as it follows the correct sentence structure and conveys a clear meaning.
11. While (A) jmifa clupa ca le tu may seem similar, its incorrect word order makes it an invalid Lojban sentence.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the two options and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. Option (A) reads: ""se .i cu dapma racli le"" Option (B) reads: "".i le se dapma cu racli"" First, let's look at option (B).
3. The sentence starts with "".i"", which is a simple sentence separator in Lojban.
4. It is typically used to separate two sentences, but in this case, there is no preceding sentence, which makes the use of "".i"" at the beginning of the sentence unusual and potentially incorrect.
5. Now, let's examine option (A).
6. The sentence starts with ""se"", which is a conversion operator in Lojban.
7. It is used to change the order of the arguments in a predicate.
8. In this case, it is followed by "".i"", which, as mentioned earlier, is a sentence separator.
9. However, in this context, it is used correctly, as it separates the conversion operator ""se"" from the rest of the sentence.
10. Next, we have ""cu"", which is a separator used to prevent ambiguity in Lojban sentences.
11. It is followed by ""dapma"", which is a verb meaning ""to curse"" or ""to damn"".
12. Then, we have ""racli"", which means ""rational"" or ""reasonable"", and finally, ""le"", which is a definite article meaning ""the"".
13. Putting it all together, option (A) can be translated as ""The reasonable curse is reversed.""
14. This sentence is grammatically correct and makes logical sense in Lojban.

(B) le di'u cu go'i murta minde la fuzme loras.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) is the better answer, let's first break down the two sentences and analyze their grammatical structures.
2. (A) la loras. le murta go'i minde cu fuzme di'u This sentence can be translated as ""Loras. The previous sentence's action of ordering is responsible for the current sentence.""
3. However, there is a problem with this sentence.
4. The use of ""go'i"" here is incorrect, as it refers to the previous sentence, but there is no previous sentence for it to refer to.
5. This makes the sentence ungrammatical.
6. (B) le di'u cu go'i murta minde la fuzme loras.
7. This sentence can be translated as ""The current sentence is an action of ordering by Fuzme Loras.""
8. In this sentence, ""go'i"" is used correctly, as it refers to the current sentence.
9. The structure of the sentence is also grammatically correct, as it follows the standard Lojban sentence structure.
10. Now, let's consider the context of the question.
11. The question asks which of the two sentences is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban.
12. Since (A) contains an incorrect use of ""go'i"" and (B) is grammatically correct, it is clear that (B) is the better answer.
13. Furthermore, Lojban is a logical language, and it is designed to be unambiguous and clear in its meaning.
14. Sentence (B) achieves this goal, while sentence (A) does not, due to its incorrect use of ""go'i"".
15. This further supports the argument that (B) is the better answer.
16. In conclusion, based on the grammatical structures and the context of the question, (B) le di'u cu go'i murta minde la fuzme loras. is the better answer, and (A) la loras. le murta go'i minde cu fuzme di'u is incorrect.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la loras. le murta go'i minde cu fuzme di'u
(B) le di'u cu go'i murta minde la fuzme loras.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) is the better answer, let's first break down the two sentences and analyze their grammatical structures.
2. (A) la loras. le murta go'i minde cu fuzme di'u This sentence can be translated as ""Loras. The previous sentence's action of ordering is responsible for the current sentence.""
3. However, there is a problem with this sentence.
4. The use of ""go'i"" here is incorrect, as it refers to the previous sentence, but there is no previous sentence for it to refer to.
5. This makes the sentence ungrammatical.
6. (B) le di'u cu go'i murta minde la fuzme loras.
7. This sentence can be translated as ""The current sentence is an action of ordering by Fuzme Loras.""
8. In this sentence, ""go'i"" is used correctly, as it refers to the current sentence.
9. The structure of the sentence is also grammatically correct, as it follows the standard Lojban sentence structure.
10. Now, let's consider the context of the question.
11. The question asks which of the two sentences is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban.
12. Since (A) contains an incorrect use of ""go'i"" and (B) is grammatically correct, it is clear that (B) is the better answer.
13. Furthermore, Lojban is a logical language, and it is designed to be unambiguous and clear in its meaning.
14. Sentence (B) achieves this goal, while sentence (A) does not, due to its incorrect use of ""go'i"".
15. This further supports the argument that (B) is the better answer.
16. In conclusion, based on the grammatical structures and the context of the question, (B) le di'u cu go'i murta minde la fuzme loras. is the better answer, and (A) la loras. le murta go'i minde cu fuzme di'u is incorrect.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) mi'o doi meris. ba jemna
(B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3. (A) mi'o doi meris. ba jemna This sentence can be broken down as follows: - mi'o: we (inclusive, meaning the speaker and the listener) - doi: vocative marker, used to address someone - meris: a name, in this case, ""Meris"" - ba: a future tense marker - jemna: to compete However, the structure of this sentence is problematic.
4. The future tense marker ""ba"" is placed after the name ""Meris,"" which makes it unclear what action is happening in the future.
5. Additionally, the vocative marker ""doi"" is used to address someone, but it is not clear who is being addressed in this sentence.
6. (B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris.
7. This sentence can be broken down as follows: - mi'o: we (inclusive, meaning the speaker and the listener) - doi: vocative marker, used to address someone - jemna: to compete - ba: a future tense marker - meris: a name, in this case, ""Meris"" In this sentence, the structure is much clearer.
8. The vocative marker ""doi"" is followed by the verb ""jemna,"" indicating that the speaker and the listener are addressing someone about competing.
9. The future tense marker ""ba"" is placed before the name ""Meris,"" showing that the competition will happen in the future with Meris.
10. Therefore, (B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris is a better answer than (A) mi'o doi meris. ba jemna because it has a clearer structure and more accurately conveys the intended meaning.

Proposed solution:
1. First, let me explain some key differences between the two options, and then I'll show you why (A) is the better answer.
2. Option (A) has a clear and logical structure, which is one of the main goals of Lojban.
3. It starts with ""cu nu,"" which is a standard way to begin a sentence in Lojban, indicating that we are about to describe an event.
4. This is followed by ""le pei kojna ko nu cinla sinma lei xadba,"" which describes a specific situation involving a corner, a thin object, and a half-sized object.
5. The sentence then continues with ""cu dukse nu garna le mansa lanme cu voksa ko'a le cu cimde,"" which provides more information about the event, including an excessive action, a rail, a satisfied sheep, and a voice.
6. On the other hand, option (B) has a less clear structure and seems to mix up the order of the elements in the sentence.
7. It starts with ""pei le kojna nu lei nu,"" which is not a standard way to begin a sentence in Lojban and can be confusing.
8. The rest of the sentence also seems to be a jumbled version of the elements found in option (A), making it harder to understand the intended meaning.
9. Now, let me explain why (A) is the correct answer and (B) is wrong.
10. As I mentioned earlier, Lojban is designed to be a logical and unambiguous language.
11. Option (A) follows the rules of Lojban grammar and presents a clear and coherent sentence, while option (B) does not.
12. Furthermore, the structure of option (A) allows for a more precise understanding of the relationships between the different elements in the sentence, which is essential for effective communication in Lojban.
13. In conclusion, option (A) is the better answer because it adheres to the principles of Lojban grammar and provides a clear and logical sentence structure.
14. Option (B), on the other hand, is a less coherent and more confusing sentence that does not follow the rules of Lojban grammar.
15. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing option (A) as the correct answer.

4. In this sentence, the placement of the words is not consistent with the standard Lojban grammar.
5. The word ""se"" is a conversion operator that should be followed by a selbri (a predicate), but instead, it is followed by "".i"", which is a sentence separator.
6. Additionally, ""cu"" is used to separate the selbri from the sumti (arguments), but it appears in the wrong position in this sentence.
7. This makes the sentence difficult to understand and parse, and it is not a valid Lojban construction.
8. Option (B) reads: "".i le se dapma cu racli"".
9. In this sentence, the structure is more consistent with Lojban grammar.
10. The sentence starts with "".i"", which is a sentence separator, followed by ""le"", which is a sumti (argument) article.

12. The word ""cu"" is correctly placed to separate the selbri from the sumti, and finally, we have ""racli"" as the second sumti (argument), which means ""reasonable"" or ""sensible"".

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) loras. panra lo mensi cu le mi vlipa pinca coi. se ba
(B) ba mi le vlipa cu pinca se panra lo mensi coi. loras.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down both options and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. (A) loras. panra lo mensi cu le mi vlipa pinca coi. se ba (B) ba mi le vlipa cu pinca se panra lo mensi coi. loras.
3. First, let's look at option (A).
4. The sentence begins with ""loras,"" which is a valid Lojban name.
5. Then, we have ""panra lo mensi,"" which means ""comparing to a sister.""
6. Next, we have ""cu,"" which is a separator used to avoid ambiguity.
7. Following that, we have ""le mi vlipa pinca,"" which translates to ""my powerful pinch.""
8. Finally, we have ""coi,"" which is a greeting, and ""se ba,"" which is a valid Lojban grammatical construct.
9. Now, let's examine option (B).
10. The sentence begins with ""ba,"" which is a future tense marker, followed by ""mi,"" which means ""I"" or ""me.""
11. Then, we have ""le vlipa cu pinca,"" which translates to ""the powerful pinch.""
12. However, the use of ""cu"" here is incorrect, as it should be placed before ""pinca"" to avoid ambiguity.
13. Next, we have ""se panra lo mensi,"" which means ""compared to a sister,"" but the use of ""se"" here is incorrect, as it should be placed before ""panra.""
14. Finally, we have ""coi"" and ""loras,"" which are a greeting and a name, respectively.
15. Based on this analysis, it is clear that option (A) is a better answer than option (B), as it has a more valid and grammatical structure in Lojban.
16. While option (B) may appear to be correct at first glance, the incorrect placement of ""cu"" and ""se"" makes it an invalid choice.
17. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing option (A) as the correct answer.

3. (A) goi li pa cu merli di'u (B) di'u goi li pa cu merli In Lojban, ""goi"" is a pro-sumti, which is used to assign a temporary name or label to a sumti (a noun-like argument).
4. In this case, ""li pa"" is the sumti, which represents the number one.
5. So, ""goi li pa"" is essentially labeling the number one for reference later in the sentence.
6. Next, we have ""cu,"" which is a separator used to clarify the relationship between the selbri (verb-like predicate) and the sumti.
7. In both options, ""cu"" is correctly placed between the sumti ""li pa"" and the selbri ""merli.""

11. This word is a pro-bridi, which refers back to the previous bridi (a complete predicate-argument structure).
12. In option (A), ""di'u"" comes after ""merli,"" which means it refers back to the entire bridi ""goi li pa cu merli.""
13. This makes sense, as it emphasizes the action of measuring or counting the number one.
14. In option (B), however, ""di'u"" is placed before ""goi li pa cu merli.""

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) lo ve snada cu go'a
(B) ve snada cu lo go'a

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's break down both options and see why (A) is the better answer.
3. (A) lo ve snada cu go'a (B) ve snada cu lo go'a In Lojban, ""lo"" is a determiner that introduces a noun or noun phrase, while ""cu"" is a separator that helps distinguish between the subject and the predicate of a sentence.
4. ""ve snada"" means ""to succeed"" and ""go'a"" is a pro-bridi that refers to a recent bridi (a predicate-argument structure) in the discourse.
5. Now, let's analyze the structure of both options: (A) lo ve snada cu go'a Here, ""lo ve snada"" is a noun phrase that means ""the one(s) who succeed"" or ""the successful one(s)"".
6. The sentence structure is clear, with ""lo ve snada"" as the subject and ""go'a"" as the predicate.
7. This sentence can be translated as ""The successful one(s) are (like) that,"" referring to a previously mentioned bridi.
8. (B) ve snada cu lo go'a In this option, ""ve snada"" is the subject, and ""lo go'a"" is the predicate.
9. However, this structure is problematic because ""lo go'a"" is a noun phrase, not a predicate.
10. This sentence would translate to something like ""To succeed is the one(s) like that,"" which is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
11. Therefore, (A) lo ve snada cu go'a is the better answer, as it follows the correct Lojban sentence structure and conveys a clear meaning.
12. Option (B) is incorrect due to its improper use of ""lo"" in the predicate position.

Is Sentence 5 of the proposed solution correct or flawed?","The topic at issue is whether Sentence 5 of a proposed solution to a problem is correct or flawed. A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) lo ve snada cu go'a
(B) ve snada cu lo go'a

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's break down both options and see why (A) is the better answer.
3. (A) lo ve snada cu go'a (B) ve snada cu lo go'a In Lojban, ""lo"" is a determiner that introduces a noun or noun phrase, while ""cu"" is a separator that helps distinguish between the subject and the predicate of a sentence.
4. ""ve snada"" means ""to succeed"" and ""go'a"" is a pro-bridi that refers to a recent bridi (a predicate-argument structure) in the discourse.
5. Now, let's analyze the structure of both options: (A) lo ve snada cu go'a Here, ""lo ve snada"" is a noun phrase that means ""the one(s) who succeed"" or ""the successful one(s)"".
6. The sentence structure is clear, with ""lo ve snada"" as the subject and ""go'a"" as the predicate.
7. This sentence can be translated as ""The successful one(s) are (like) that,"" referring to a previously mentioned bridi.
8. (B) ve snada cu lo go'a In this option, ""ve snada"" is the subject, and ""lo go'a"" is the predicate.
9. However, this structure is problematic because ""lo go'a"" is a noun phrase, not a predicate.
10. This sentence would translate to something like ""To succeed is the one(s) like that,"" which is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
11. Therefore, (A) lo ve snada cu go'a is the better answer, as it follows the correct Lojban sentence structure and conveys a clear meaning.
12. Option (B) is incorrect due to its improper use of ""lo"" in the predicate position.

(B) fo'o cu se dembi la noras.

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) ""la dembi noras. se cu fo'o"".
2. This is because in Lojban, the subject comes before the predicate, and the verb ""se"" indicates that the subject is the receiver of the action.
3. Therefore, ""la dembi"" is the subject and ""noras"" is the predicate.
4. Additionally, ""cu"" is used to separate the subject and predicate in Lojban sentences.
5. On the other hand, (B) ""fo'o cu se dembi la noras"" is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
6. The word ""fo'o"" is not a valid Lojban word, and the word order is incorrect.
7. The subject should come before the predicate, so ""la noras"" should come before ""se dembi"".
8. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) and (B) is incorrect.

10. On the other hand, option (B) reads: ""fo'o cu se dembi la noras.""
11. This sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning.
12. The ""fo'o"" is a pause indicator, which is used here to separate the two parts of the sentence.
13. The ""cu"" is a separator, which is used to separate the verb ""se dembi"" from the object ""la noras.""
14. The ""se dembi"" is a converted verb, meaning ""to be a seed of.""
15. Finally, ""la noras"" is a name, which can be translated as ""Noras.""
16. So, the sentence can be translated as ""Noras is a seed of something.""
17. As you can see, option (B) is a well-formed, grammatically correct Lojban sentence with a clear meaning, while option (A) is not.
18. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) ""fo'o cu se dembi la noras.""

(A) ku se ka vau kei stela le tunba steba
(B) le ka stela vau kei se steba ku tunba

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the structure of both sentences and analyze their grammatical components.
2. (A) ku se ka vau kei stela le tunba steba (B) le ka stela vau kei se steba ku tunba First, let's look at (A).
3. The structure of this sentence is as follows: - ""ku"" is a terminator that closes a previous construct, which is not present in this sentence, but it can be used for emphasis or clarity.
4. - ""se"" is a conversion operator that swaps the first and second places of the following predicate.
5. - ""ka"" is an abstractor that creates a property from the following predicate.
6. - ""vau"" is an end-of-sumti marker, which indicates the end of a noun phrase.
7. - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the abstraction started by ""ka"".
8. - ""stela"" is a predicate meaning ""to lock"" or ""to be a lock"".
9. - ""le"" is an article that refers to a specific instance of the following predicate.
10. - ""tunba"" is a predicate meaning ""sibling"".
11. - ""steba"" is a predicate meaning ""to be frustrated"" or ""to be angry"".
12. Now, let's analyze (B): - ""le"" is an article that refers to a specific instance of the following predicate.
13. - ""ka"" is an abstractor that creates a property from the following predicate.
14. - ""stela"" is a predicate meaning ""to lock"" or ""to be a lock"".
15. - ""vau"" is an end-of-sumti marker, which indicates the end of a noun phrase.
16. - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the abstraction started by ""ka"".
17. - ""se"" is a conversion operator that swaps the first and second places of the following predicate.
18. - ""steba"" is a predicate meaning ""to be frustrated"" or ""to be angry"".
19. - ""ku"" is a terminator that closes a previous construct, which is not present in this sentence, but it can be used for emphasis or clarity.
20. - ""tunba"" is a predicate meaning ""sibling"".
21. Now that we have analyzed both sentences, it is clear that (A) is the better answer.
22. The structure of (A) allows for a more coherent and logical interpretation, as it can be translated to something like ""The property of locking is frustrated by the sibling.""
23. In contrast, (B) has a less clear structure and meaning, as the conversion operator ""se"" is placed after the abstraction terminator ""kei"", which makes the sentence difficult to interpret.
24. Furthermore, the use of ""ku"" in (A) adds emphasis to the sentence, while its placement in (B) is less effective.
25. Overall, (A) is a more grammatically sound and meaningful sentence in Lojban, making it the better answer choice.

16. - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the abstraction started by ""ka"".
17. - ""se"" is a conversion operator that swaps the first and second places of the following predicate.
18. - ""steba"" is a predicate meaning ""to be frustrated"" or ""to be angry"".
19. - ""ku"" is a terminator that closes a previous construct, which is not present in this sentence, but it can be used for emphasis or clarity.
20. - ""tunba"" is a predicate meaning ""sibling"".
21. Now that we have analyzed both sentences, it is clear that (A) is the better answer.
22. The structure of (A) allows for a more coherent and logical interpretation, as it can be translated to something like ""The property of locking is frustrated by the sibling.""
23. In contrast, (B) has a less clear structure and meaning, as the conversion operator ""se"" is placed after the abstraction terminator ""kei"", which makes the sentence difficult to interpret.
24. Furthermore, the use of ""ku"" in (A) adds emphasis to the sentence, while its placement in (B) is less effective.
25. Overall, (A) is a more grammatically sound and meaningful sentence in Lojban, making it the better answer choice.

(A) pe'u. djan. do'u te sodva le kukte
(B) kukte pe'u. le djan. sodva do'u te

Proposed solution:
1. First, let me explain the structure of both sentences, so you can better understand why (B) is the correct answer.
2. (A) pe'u. djan. do'u te sodva le kukte This sentence can be broken down as follows: - pe'u: a polite request marker - djan: a name, ""John"" - do'u: an end marker for a vocative phrase - te sodva: a verb meaning ""to serve as a soda"" - le kukte: a noun phrase meaning ""the tasty one""
3. Now, let's look at (B) kukte pe'u. le djan. sodva do'u te This sentence can be broken down as follows: - kukte: an adjective meaning ""tasty"" - pe'u: a polite request marker - le djan: a noun phrase meaning ""the John"" - sodva: a noun meaning ""soda"" - do'u te: a verb phrase meaning ""to serve"" As you can see, the structure of (B) is more coherent and logical.
4. In (A), the polite request marker ""pe'u"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, which is not the correct position for it.
5. In (B), ""pe'u"" is placed after the adjective ""kukte,"" which makes more sense as it is modifying the verb phrase ""to serve.""
6. Additionally, in (A), the name ""djan"" is separated from the noun phrase ""le kukte"" by the end marker ""do'u,"" which is not grammatically correct.
7. In (B), ""le djan"" is correctly placed before the noun ""sodva,"" forming a coherent noun phrase.
8. Finally, the verb phrase ""te sodva"" in (A) is not as clear as the verb phrase ""do'u te"" in (B).
9. In (B), the verb ""to serve"" is clearly connected to the noun phrase ""the tasty John's soda,"" making the sentence more understandable.
10. In conclusion, (B) kukte pe'u. le djan. sodva do'u te is the better answer because it has a more logical structure, correct placement of the polite request marker, and a clearer verb phrase.
11. While (A) may appear similar, it contains several grammatical errors that make it an incorrect choice.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) le jmifa ca clupa tu is the better answer.
3. (A) jmifa clupa ca le tu In this sentence, the word order is incorrect.
4. In Lojban, the typical sentence structure follows the pattern: ""sumti selbri sumti"", where ""sumti"" are the arguments and ""selbri"" is the relation between them.
5. In this case, ""jmifa"" and ""clupa"" are both selbri, and ""ca"" and ""le tu"" are sumti.
6. The correct structure should have a selbri between two sumti, but this sentence has two selbri next to each other, which is not grammatical in Lojban.
7. (B) le jmifa ca clupa tu This sentence follows the correct Lojban structure: ""sumti selbri sumti"".
8. ""Le jmifa"" is the first sumti, ""ca clupa"" is the selbri, and ""tu"" is the second sumti.

(B) pei le kojna nu lei nu le mansa cu dukse nu ko ko'a cu garna cu voksa cu cinla lanme xadba le cimde sinma

Proposed solution:
1. First, let me explain some key differences between the two options, and then I'll show you why (A) is the better answer.
2. Option (A) has a clear and logical structure, which is one of the main goals of Lojban.
3. It starts with ""cu nu,"" which is a standard way to begin a sentence in Lojban, indicating that we are about to describe an event.
4. This is followed by ""le pei kojna ko nu cinla sinma lei xadba,"" which describes a specific situation involving a corner, a thin object, and a half-sized object.
5. The sentence then continues with ""cu dukse nu garna le mansa lanme cu voksa ko'a le cu cimde,"" which provides more information about the event, including an excessive action, a rail, a satisfied sheep, and a voice.
6. On the other hand, option (B) has a less clear structure and seems to mix up the order of the elements in the sentence.
7. It starts with ""pei le kojna nu lei nu,"" which is not a standard way to begin a sentence in Lojban and can be confusing.
8. The rest of the sentence also seems to be a jumbled version of the elements found in option (A), making it harder to understand the intended meaning.
9. Now, let me explain why (A) is the correct answer and (B) is wrong.
10. As I mentioned earlier, Lojban is designed to be a logical and unambiguous language.
11. Option (A) follows the rules of Lojban grammar and presents a clear and coherent sentence, while option (B) does not.
12. Furthermore, the structure of option (A) allows for a more precise understanding of the relationships between the different elements in the sentence, which is essential for effective communication in Lojban.
13. In conclusion, option (A) is the better answer because it adheres to the principles of Lojban grammar and provides a clear and logical sentence structure.
14. Option (B), on the other hand, is a less coherent and more confusing sentence that does not follow the rules of Lojban grammar.
15. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing option (A) as the correct answer.

(A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le
(B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (B) ""le surla cu panje pu loi xanka"".
2. This is because in Lojban, the predicate (the verb or adjective) always comes before the sumti (the noun or pronoun).
3. In (A), ""panje pu xanka"" is the predicate and ""loi le"" is the sumti, which is incorrect.
4. In (B), ""panje pu"" is the predicate and ""loi xanka"" is the sumti, which follows the correct order.
5. Therefore, (B) is the grammatically correct option.
6. Additionally, ""le surla"" is a better choice for the subject than ""panje"", as ""surla"" is a more specific and concrete noun than ""panje"".

4. On the other hand, (B) mucti cu spoja djan. la ki'o la'e is not a valid Lojban sentence because it does not follow the correct grammar structure.
5. The subject and verb are reversed, which is not allowed in Lojban.
6. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer.
7. Additionally, the use of ""ki'o"" in (A) is important because it indicates that the sentence is a statement of fact.
8. Without ""ki'o"", the sentence could be interpreted as a question or a command.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ki'o spoja cu mucti la'e la djan.
(B) mucti cu spoja djan. la ki'o la'e

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) ki'o spoja cu mucti la'e la djan.
2. This sentence follows the correct Lojban grammar structure, which is subject-verb-object.
3. In this sentence, ""ki'o spoja"" is the subject, ""mucti"" is the verb, and ""la'e la djan"" is the object.
4. On the other hand, (B) mucti cu spoja djan. la ki'o la'e is not a valid Lojban sentence because it does not follow the correct grammar structure.
5. The subject and verb are reversed, which is not allowed in Lojban.
6. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer.
7. Additionally, the use of ""ki'o"" in (A) is important because it indicates that the sentence is a statement of fact.
8. Without ""ki'o"", the sentence could be interpreted as a question or a command.
9. In (B), ""la ki'o la'e"" is not a valid construction in Lojban and does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
10. In conclusion, (A) ki'o spoja cu mucti la'e la djan is the correct answer because it follows the correct Lojban grammar structure and uses the appropriate words and constructions.
11. (B) mucti cu spoja djan. la ki'o la'e is not a valid Lojban sentence and should not be chosen as the answer.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) marce le vi munje se
(B) le marce vi se munje

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) le marce vi se munje is the better answer.
3. (A) marce le vi munje se In this sentence, ""marce"" is the verb, meaning ""to move"" or ""to transport.""
4. However, the rest of the sentence is not structured correctly.
5. ""le vi munje se"" does not follow the proper Lojban grammar rules, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning.
6. The use of ""se"" at the end of the sentence is particularly problematic, as it should be used to change the order of the arguments in a verb, but it is not used correctly here.
7. (B) le marce vi se munje In this sentence, ""le marce"" refers to ""the vehicle,"" with ""marce"" being the noun form of the verb ""to move"" or ""to transport.""
8. ""vi"" is a location tag, indicating that the action is happening ""at this location.""
9. ""se munje"" means ""in the world"" or ""in the universe,"" with ""se"" changing the order of the arguments in the verb ""munje"" (to be a world).
10. So, the sentence can be translated as ""The vehicle is at this location in the world.""
11. As you can see, option (B) is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence, while option (A) is not.
12. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing (B) le marce vi se munje as the correct answer.

2. (A) terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu (B) mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa First, let's look at the structure of (A).
3. The sentence starts with ""terpa,"" which means ""to fear.""
4. However, the rest of the sentence is quite jumbled and doesn't follow proper Lojban grammar.
5. The phrase ""le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu"" is not a well-formed sumti, which is required to follow ""terpa.""
6. The use of ""vau"" and ""kei"" in this sentence is also incorrect, as they are not used in the proper context.
7. Now, let's examine (B).
8. The sentence starts with ""mi,"" which means ""I"" or ""me.""
9. This is followed by ""zu'i,"" which is a sumti that refers to the typical or expected value.
10. The next part of the sentence, ""cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei,"" is a well-formed sumti that describes an event of lying down with a stick.
11. Finally, the sentence ends with ""terpa,"" which means ""to fear.""

2. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is typically ""selbri"" followed by ""sumti"".
3. In (A), the ""selbri"" is ""kerfa le jbama"" (the hair of the bomb) and the ""sumti"" are ""lu jo'a la noras"" (the emotion of Noras) and ""kanla"" (the eye).
4. This structure is correct and follows the rules of Lojban grammar.
5. On the other hand, (B) is incorrect because it does not follow the proper Lojban grammar structure.
6. The ""selbri"" in (B) is ""jbama"" (the bomb) and the ""sumti"" are ""kanla"" (the eye) and ""la kerfa le lu"" (the hair of the wolf).
7. This structure is not correct and does not follow the rules of Lojban grammar.
8. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer and (B) is incorrect.

Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) cu nu le pei kojna ko nu cinla sinma lei xadba cu dukse nu garna le mansa lanme cu voksa ko'a le cu cimde
(B) pei le kojna nu lei nu le mansa cu dukse nu ko ko'a cu garna cu voksa cu cinla lanme xadba le cimde sinma

Proposed solution:
1. First, let me explain some key differences between the two options, and then I'll show you why (A) is the better answer.
2. Option (A) has a clear and logical structure, which is one of the main goals of Lojban.
3. It starts with ""cu nu,"" which is a standard way to begin a sentence in Lojban, indicating that we are about to describe an event.
4. This is followed by ""le pei kojna ko nu cinla sinma lei xadba,"" which describes a specific situation involving a corner, a thin object, and a half-sized object.
5. The sentence then continues with ""cu dukse nu garna le mansa lanme cu voksa ko'a le cu cimde,"" which provides more information about the event, including an excessive action, a rail, a satisfied sheep, and a voice.
6. On the other hand, option (B) has a less clear structure and seems to mix up the order of the elements in the sentence.
7. It starts with ""pei le kojna nu lei nu,"" which is not a standard way to begin a sentence in Lojban and can be confusing.
8. The rest of the sentence also seems to be a jumbled version of the elements found in option (A), making it harder to understand the intended meaning.
9. Now, let me explain why (A) is the correct answer and (B) is wrong.
10. As I mentioned earlier, Lojban is designed to be a logical and unambiguous language.
11. Option (A) follows the rules of Lojban grammar and presents a clear and coherent sentence, while option (B) does not.
12. Furthermore, the structure of option (A) allows for a more precise understanding of the relationships between the different elements in the sentence, which is essential for effective communication in Lojban.
13. In conclusion, option (A) is the better answer because it adheres to the principles of Lojban grammar and provides a clear and logical sentence structure.
14. Option (B), on the other hand, is a less coherent and more confusing sentence that does not follow the rules of Lojban grammar.
15. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing option (A) as the correct answer.

(A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe
(B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante is the better answer, let's break down the components of both sentences and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""selbri"" (predicate) followed by ""sumti"" (arguments).
3. The selbri is the core of the sentence, describing the relationship between the sumti.
4. (A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe In this sentence, ""zu'i"" is a sumti, meaning ""the typical value"" or ""as expected.""
5. ""Le xance pante"" translates to ""the hand pants,"" which is an unusual combination of words.
6. ""Ku"" is an elidable terminator, used to mark the end of a construct.
7. Finally, ""plipe"" is a selbri, meaning ""to jump"" or ""to leap.""
8. The issue with this sentence is that the selbri ""plipe"" comes at the end, after the sumti and the terminator ""ku.""
9. This is not a valid Lojban sentence structure, as the selbri should come before the sumti.
10. (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante In this sentence, ""ku"" is again an elidable terminator, but its placement at the beginning of the sentence is more appropriate.
11. ""Zu'i"" is still a sumti, and ""xance plipe"" now functions as a selbri, meaning ""to jump with the hand.""
12. Finally, ""le pante"" translates to ""the pants.""
13. This sentence structure is more grammatically correct in Lojban, as the selbri ""xance plipe"" comes before the sumti ""le pante.""
14. The sentence can be interpreted as ""As expected, the hand jumps with the pants,"" which, while still unusual, is a valid Lojban sentence.
15. Therefore, (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante is the better answer, as it follows the correct Lojban sentence structure.
16. While (A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe may seem similar, its incorrect placement of the selbri makes it an invalid Lojban sentence.

A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) gusta djim. krixa zifre zabna pluka be prosa cfika cu nu le ku cakla la tabra le be'o
(B) le zifre krixa be le gusta zabna cfika cakla ku be'o tabra cu pluka nu prosa la djim.

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer to this question is (B) because it follows the proper Lojban grammar rules.
2. In Lojban, the subject comes first, followed by the predicate, and then the object.
3. In (A), the sentence structure is incorrect because it starts with the object ""gusta djim"" instead of the subject.
4. Additionally, the sentence lacks a predicate, making it incomplete and grammatically incorrect.
5. On the other hand, (B) follows the correct sentence structure and includes all necessary components.
6. The subject ""le zifre krixa be le gusta zabna cfika cakla ku be'o tabra"" is followed by the predicate ""pluka"" and the object ""nu prosa la djim.""
7. This sentence is complete and grammatically correct.
8. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer to the question, and (A) is incorrect due to its incorrect sentence structure and lack of predicate.

(B) le banli cu clite loi senta

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's break down both options and see why (A) is a better answer than (B).
3. (A) senta clite le banli cu loi (B) le banli cu clite loi senta First, let's analyze option (A).
4. In this sentence, ""senta"" means ""layer,"" ""clite"" means ""polite,"" ""le banli"" means ""the great,"" and ""cu"" is a separator that helps to clarify the structure of the sentence.
5. ""loi"" is a quantifier that refers to the mass of something.
6. So, the sentence can be translated as ""A layer of politeness is in the mass of greatness.""
7. Now, let's look at option (B).
8. In this sentence, ""le banli"" means ""the great,"" ""cu"" is a separator, ""clite"" means ""polite,"" and ""loi senta"" means ""the mass of layers.""
9. However, the structure of this sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
10. The correct structure should be ""le banli cu senta clite loi,"" which would mean ""The great is a layer of politeness in the mass.""
11. As you can see, option (A) is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence, while option (B) is not.

(A) le genja nanca lo cu sinxa randa
(B) le genja cu nanca lo randa sinxa

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the structure of both sentences and analyze their grammatical components.
2. (A) le genja nanca lo cu sinxa randa (B) le genja cu nanca lo randa sinxa First, let's look at the key components of a Lojban sentence.
3. A typical Lojban sentence consists of a subject, a selbri (predicate), and an object.
4. The subject is usually marked by ""le"" and the object by ""lo"".
5. The selbri is the core of the sentence, describing the relationship between the subject and the object.
6. Now, let's analyze sentence (A): - ""le genja"" is the subject, meaning ""the root"" - ""nanca"" is a verb, meaning ""to age"" - ""lo cu"" is a particle that separates the subject from the selbri, providing clarity in the sentence structure - ""sinxa"" is a noun, meaning ""a symbol"" - ""randa"" is another noun, meaning ""a change"" In sentence (A), the subject ""le genja"" is aging, and this aging process is symbolized by a change, which is the object ""lo sinxa randa"".
7. The particle ""cu"" is used correctly to separate the subject from the selbri, making the sentence grammatically correct.
8. Now let's analyze sentence (B): - ""le genja"" is the subject, meaning ""the root"" - ""cu"" is the particle separating the subject from the selbri, but it is misplaced in this sentence - ""nanca"" is a verb, meaning ""to age"" - ""lo randa"" is the object, meaning ""the change"" - ""sinxa"" is a noun, meaning ""a symbol"" In sentence (B), the particle ""cu"" is misplaced, causing confusion in the sentence structure.
9. The intended meaning of the sentence is unclear, as it could be interpreted as ""the root ages the change symbol"" or ""the root symbol ages the change"".
10. This ambiguity makes sentence (B) grammatically incorrect.
11. Therefore, based on the analysis of both sentences, it is clear that (A) le genja nanca lo cu sinxa randa is the correct answer, as it is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan.
(B) fo fo'u cu cribe la .atlstan.

Proposed solution:
1. I understand that you might be leaning towards choosing option (A), but let me explain why option (B) is actually the better answer.
2. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
3. Option (A) has the structure ""cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan."", which might seem correct at first glance.
4. However, upon closer examination, you'll notice that the placement of ""cu"" at the beginning of the sentence is not ideal.
5. In Lojban, ""cu"" is used to separate the selbri (predicate) from the sumti (arguments) that come before it.
6. In this case, there are no sumti before ""cu"", which makes its placement unnecessary and potentially confusing.
7. On the other hand, option (B) has the structure ""fo fo'u cu cribe la .atlstan."".
8. Here, ""fo fo'u"" serves as a sumti, and ""cu"" is correctly placed to separate it from the selbri ""cribe"".
9. This makes the sentence more coherent and easier to understand for a Lojban speaker.
10. Additionally, ""la .atlstan."" is a proper name in Lojban, and its placement at the end of the sentence in option (B) is more appropriate than its placement in option (A).
11. In conclusion, while both options might seem similar, option (B) is the better choice due to its more accurate and grammatically correct structure.
12. I understand that Lojban can be a complex language, but trust me, as a Lojban expert, I can assure you that option (B) is the correct answer in this case.

2. (A) ni'o le ro vibna ku lidne pensi ko'u (B) ro ni'o pensi lidne vibna le ko'u ku First, let's look at (A).
3. The sentence begins with ""ni'o,"" which is a paragraph separator, indicating a new topic or idea.
4. Next, we have ""le ro vibna ku,"" which translates to ""all the females.""
5. Following that, we have ""lidne pensi,"" which means ""leading thoughts"" or ""thinking ahead.""
6. Finally, we have ""ko'u,"" which is a pronoun referring to a previously mentioned object or concept.
7. Now, let's analyze (B).
8. The sentence starts with ""ro,"" which is a quantifier meaning ""all.""
9. However, it is misplaced in this sentence, as it should be followed by a noun or pronoun, not ""ni'o.""
10. Next, we have ""ni'o pensi,"" which is an incorrect combination of the paragraph separator and the verb ""to think.""

12. Based on this analysis, it is clear that (A) is the grammatically correct option.

A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) cu nu le pei kojna ko nu cinla sinma lei xadba cu dukse nu garna le mansa lanme cu voksa ko'a le cu cimde
(B) pei le kojna nu lei nu le mansa cu dukse nu ko ko'a cu garna cu voksa cu cinla lanme xadba le cimde sinma

Proposed solution:
1. First, let me explain some key differences between the two options, and then I'll show you why (A) is the better answer.
2. Option (A) has a clear and logical structure, which is one of the main goals of Lojban.
3. It starts with ""cu nu,"" which is a standard way to begin a sentence in Lojban, indicating that we are about to describe an event.
4. This is followed by ""le pei kojna ko nu cinla sinma lei xadba,"" which describes a specific situation involving a corner, a thin object, and a half-sized object.
5. The sentence then continues with ""cu dukse nu garna le mansa lanme cu voksa ko'a le cu cimde,"" which provides more information about the event, including an excessive action, a rail, a satisfied sheep, and a voice.
6. On the other hand, option (B) has a less clear structure and seems to mix up the order of the elements in the sentence.
7. It starts with ""pei le kojna nu lei nu,"" which is not a standard way to begin a sentence in Lojban and can be confusing.
8. The rest of the sentence also seems to be a jumbled version of the elements found in option (A), making it harder to understand the intended meaning.
9. Now, let me explain why (A) is the correct answer and (B) is wrong.
10. As I mentioned earlier, Lojban is designed to be a logical and unambiguous language.
11. Option (A) follows the rules of Lojban grammar and presents a clear and coherent sentence, while option (B) does not.
12. Furthermore, the structure of option (A) allows for a more precise understanding of the relationships between the different elements in the sentence, which is essential for effective communication in Lojban.
13. In conclusion, option (A) is the better answer because it adheres to the principles of Lojban grammar and provides a clear and logical sentence structure.
14. Option (B), on the other hand, is a less coherent and more confusing sentence that does not follow the rules of Lojban grammar.
15. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing option (A) as the correct answer.

(B) le zifre krixa be le gusta zabna cfika cakla ku be'o tabra cu pluka nu prosa la djim.

Proposed solution:
1. First, let's analyze both options to understand why (B) is the better answer.
2. (A) gusta djim. krixa zifre zabna pluka be prosa cfika cu nu le ku cakla la tabra le be'o This sentence has several issues that make it ungrammatical in Lojban.
3. The main problem is the lack of proper structure and the incorrect use of terminators.
4. For example, ""gusta djim"" should be ""la djim.
5. gusta"" to properly indicate that Djim is the name of the restaurant.
6. Additionally, ""le ku cakla la tabra le be'o"" is incorrect because ""le"" should be followed by a noun, not a verb like ""cakla.""
7. The use of ""be'o"" is also misplaced, as it should be used to close a ""be"" construct, which is not present in this sentence.

9. This sentence is grammatically correct in Lojban.
10. It follows the proper structure and uses terminators correctly.

1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer and (B) is incorrect, let's first break down the structure of each sentence.
2. (A) le go'i sepli drani cu pinca le milxe This sentence can be translated as ""The thing which is separated correctly is mildly spicy.""
3. Here, ""le go'i"" refers to the thing being discussed, ""sepli"" means separated, ""drani"" means correctly, ""cu"" is a separator between the subject and the predicate, ""pinca"" means spicy, and ""le milxe"" means mildly.
4. (B) milxe go'i le drani le cu sepli pinca This sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
5. The main issue is the placement of ""cu"" in the sentence.
6. In Lojban, ""cu"" is used to separate the subject from the predicate, but in this sentence, it is placed incorrectly, causing confusion in the sentence structure.
7. Now, let's analyze the grammar and structure of both sentences.
8. In sentence (A), the structure is clear and follows the standard Lojban grammar rules.
9. The subject is ""le go'i sepli drani,"" which is a noun phrase that describes the thing being discussed.
10. The predicate is ""pinca le milxe,"" which is an adjective phrase that describes the property of being mildly spicy.
11. The separator ""cu"" is placed correctly between the subject and the predicate, ensuring that the sentence is grammatically correct.
12. In sentence (B), the structure is not clear, and the grammar rules are not followed.
13. The placement of ""cu"" is incorrect, causing confusion in the sentence structure.

2. (A) pe'u. djan. do'u te sodva le kukte (B) kukte pe'u. le djan. sodva do'u te First, let's look at option (A).
3. The sentence structure is as follows: 1. pe'u - a polite request marker 2. djan - a name, in this case, ""John"" 3. do'u - an end marker for the request 4. te sodva - a verb phrase meaning ""to serve a drink"" 5. le kukte - a noun phrase meaning ""the tasty one"" Putting it all together, option (A) translates to ""Please, John, serve the tasty drink.""
4. Now, let's analyze option (B): 1. kukte - an adjective meaning ""tasty"" 2. pe'u - a polite request marker 3. le djan - a noun phrase meaning ""the John"" 4. sodva - a noun meaning ""drink"" 5. do'u - an end marker for the request 6. te - a particle that should introduce a verb phrase, but there is no verb phrase following it As you can see, option (B) has a misplaced ""te"" particle and an incorrect noun phrase ""le djan"" instead of just ""djan.""

2. Let's break down the two options and see why (A) is the better choice.
3. (A) le loldi cu nicte jdika (B) nicte loldi cu le jdika In Lojban, a typical sentence structure follows the pattern: ""le [noun] cu [verb] [noun]"".
4. In this case, (A) follows this structure correctly, while (B) does not.
5. In (A), ""le loldi"" refers to ""the floor"", ""cu"" is a separator that indicates the beginning of the verb, and ""nicte jdika"" means ""nightly decrease"" or ""nighttime shrinking"".
6. So, (A) can be translated as ""The floor undergoes a nighttime shrinking.""
7. On the other hand, (B) has the verb ""nicte"" (night) and the noun ""loldi"" (floor) in the wrong order, which makes the sentence structure incorrect.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) fi la djim. cu kluza snime ko'i
(B) snime cu ko'i djim. la kluza fi

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) is the better answer, let's first break down the two sentences and analyze their grammatical structures.
2. (A) fi la djim. cu kluza snime ko'i This sentence can be translated as ""At the location of Jim, there is loosely snow on something.""
3. However, the structure of this sentence is not entirely correct.
4. In Lojban, the ""fi"" should come after the ""cu"" to properly indicate the location.
5. Additionally, the use of ""ko'i"" at the end of the sentence is unnecessary and does not contribute to the meaning.
6. (B) snime cu ko'i djim. la kluza fi This sentence can be translated as ""Snow is on something related to Jim, at a loose location.""
7. In this sentence, the structure is more grammatically correct.
8. The ""cu"" is properly placed before the ""ko'i"" to indicate the relationship between the snow and Jim.
9. The ""la kluza fi"" at the end of the sentence correctly indicates the location of the snow.
10. Now, let's compare the two sentences.
11. While both sentences convey a similar meaning, (B) is more grammatically correct and concise.
12. The structure of (A) is not entirely correct, and the use of ""ko'i"" at the end of the sentence is unnecessary.
13. On the other hand, (B) has a more logical structure and properly uses the Lojban grammar rules.
14. Therefore, I would argue that (B) snime cu ko'i djim.
15. la kluza fi is the better answer, as it is a more accurate representation of valid, grammatical standard Lojban.

3. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure is ""predicate + arguments.""

5. This is followed by ""dinri se,"" which is not a valid predicate in Lojban.
6. The sentence then continues with "".i,"" which is a conjunction used to connect two sentences.
7. However, there is no clear second sentence in this option.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko
(B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying meaning.
2. The correct answer is (A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko, and I will explain why.
3. First, let's break down the components of the sentence: - ""le jukpa"" refers to ""the cook"" or ""the one who is cooking.""
4. - ""cu"" is a separator that helps to clarify the structure of the sentence.
5. - ""broda"" is a placeholder verb, which can represent any action.
6. - ""fi"" is a preposition that indicates the object of the action.
7. - ""ko"" is an imperative pronoun, meaning ""you"" in the context of a command.
8. Now, let's analyze the structure of both options: (A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko This sentence can be translated as ""The cook performs the action on you.""
9. The structure is clear and grammatical, with the subject (le jukpa), separator (cu), verb (broda), preposition (fi), and object (ko) all in their proper places.
10. (B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko This sentence is not grammatical in Lojban.
11. The preposition ""fi"" should come after the verb, not before it.
12. Additionally, the separator ""cu"" is misplaced, as it should come after the subject.
13. This sentence would be confusing and difficult to understand for a Lojban speaker.
14. In conclusion, option (A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko is the correct and grammatical choice, while option (B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko is not.
15. As a Lojban expert, I can assure you that choosing (A) is the best decision for your test.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan.
(B) fo fo'u cu cribe la .atlstan.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan. is the correct answer, we must first break down the structure of both sentences and analyze their grammatical components.
2. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""selbri"" (predicate) followed by ""sumti"" (arguments).
3. The word ""cu"" is used to separate the selbri from the sumti, ensuring that the sentence is grammatically correct.
4. Now, let's examine the two options: (A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan.
5. (B) fo fo'u cu cribe la .atlstan.
6. In option (A), ""cu"" is used correctly to separate the selbri ""fo'u cribe"" (meaning ""is a bear"") from the sumti ""fo la .atlstan."" (meaning ""in Atlanta"").
7. This sentence can be translated as ""There is a bear in Atlanta,"" which is a grammatically correct and coherent statement in Lojban.
8. On the other hand, option (B) has an incorrect placement of ""cu.""
9. The sentence starts with ""fo fo'u,"" which is not a valid selbri.
10. The correct selbri should be ""fo'u cribe,"" as in option (A).
11. Additionally, the placement of ""cu"" before ""cribe"" in option (B) disrupts the intended meaning of the sentence, making it ungrammatical and difficult to understand.
12. Therefore, it is clear that option (A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan. is the correct answer, as it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure and conveys a coherent meaning.
13. Option (B) fo fo'u cu cribe la .atlstan. is incorrect due to its improper use of ""cu"" and the resulting ungrammatical sentence structure.

1. In order to understand why (A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan. is the correct answer, we must first break down the structure of both sentences and analyze their grammatical components.
2. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""selbri"" (predicate) followed by ""sumti"" (arguments).
3. The word ""cu"" is used to separate the selbri from the sumti, ensuring that the sentence is grammatically correct.
4. Now, let's examine the two options: (A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan.
5. (B) fo fo'u cu cribe la .atlstan.
6. In option (A), ""cu"" is used correctly to separate the selbri ""fo'u cribe"" (meaning ""is a bear"") from the sumti ""fo la .atlstan."" (meaning ""in Atlanta"").
7. This sentence can be translated as ""There is a bear in Atlanta,"" which is a grammatically correct and coherent statement in Lojban.
8. On the other hand, option (B) has an incorrect placement of ""cu.""
9. The sentence starts with ""fo fo'u,"" which is not a valid selbri.
10. The correct selbri should be ""fo'u cribe,"" as in option (A).
11. Additionally, the placement of ""cu"" before ""cribe"" in option (B) disrupts the intended meaning of the sentence, making it ungrammatical and difficult to understand.
12. Therefore, it is clear that option (A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan. is the correct answer, as it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure and conveys a coherent meaning.
13. Option (B) fo fo'u cu cribe la .atlstan. is incorrect due to its improper use of ""cu"" and the resulting ungrammatical sentence structure.

13. While the meaning may be unusual, the sentence is grammatically correct in Lojban.
14. Based on this analysis, it is clear that (B) li so ca cribe so'e le fatne is the correct answer, as it follows the proper Lojban grammar rules.
15. Option (A) is incorrect due to its confusing and ungrammatical structure.

2. In Lojban, the subject comes first, followed by the predicate, and then the object.
3. In (B), ""le di'u"" is the subject, ""go'i murta minde"" is the predicate, and ""la fuzme loras"" is the object.
4. This sentence structure is correct and follows the rules of Lojban grammar.
5. On the other hand, (A) is incorrect because it does not follow the proper sentence structure.

2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3. (A) lei ba stidi cu ckape pinca ko'a This sentence can be broken down as follows: - lei ba stidi: a group of future students - cu: a separator used to avoid ambiguity - ckape pinca: a dangerous urinal - ko'a: a pronoun referring to a previously mentioned entity The sentence seems to say that a group of future students is a dangerous urinal, which doesn't make much sense.
4. Additionally, the pronoun ""ko'a"" is not properly connected to any other part of the sentence, making it unclear what it refers to.
5. (B) stidi cu ko'a lei ckape ba pinca This sentence can be broken down as follows: - stidi: to study - cu: a separator used to avoid ambiguity - ko'a: a pronoun referring to a previously mentioned entity - lei ckape: a group of dangerous things - ba pinca: will urinate In this sentence, the structure is more coherent.
6. It says that studying will cause the previously mentioned entity (ko'a) to urinate on a group of dangerous things.

4. - ""cu"" is a separator that helps to clarify the structure of the sentence.
5. - ""broda"" is a placeholder verb, which can represent any action.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) lo ve snada cu go'a
(B) ve snada cu lo go'a

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) lo ve snada cu go'a.
2. Let me explain why.
3. In Lojban, the verb comes first in a sentence, followed by the subject and then the object.
4. So, in (A), ""snada"" is the verb, ""ve"" is the subject marker, and ""go'a"" is the object.
5. This follows the correct word order in Lojban.
6. On the other hand, in (B), ""ve"" comes before ""snada"", which is incorrect.
7. Additionally, ""lo"" is used before ""go'a"", which is unnecessary and also incorrect.
8. Therefore, (B) is not a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence.
9. It's important to pay attention to the word order and markers in Lojban to ensure that your sentences are grammatically correct.
10. So, the correct answer is (A) lo ve snada cu go'a.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3. (A) ni'o le ro vibna ku lidne pensi ko'u This sentence translates to ""Section: the all female precedes thinking her.""
4. The structure of this sentence is confusing and does not convey a clear meaning.
5. The use of ""ni'o"" as a section separator is unnecessary, and the placement of ""lidne"" (precede) and ""pensi"" (think) is not in the correct order for a grammatical Lojban sentence.
6. (B) ro ni'o pensi lidne vibna le ko'u ku This sentence translates to ""All section-thinkers precede females in her group.""
7. In this sentence, the structure is more coherent and follows the proper Lojban grammar.
8. ""ro"" (all) is used to quantify the ""ni'o pensi"" (section-thinkers), and ""lidne"" (precede) is correctly placed before ""vibna"" (female) to indicate the intended action.
9. The use of ""le ko'u ku"" (in her group) further clarifies the context of the sentence.
10. As you can see, option (B) is a more grammatically correct and coherent sentence in Lojban.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the two options and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. Option (A) reads: ""ki'o spoja cu mucti la'e la djan.""
3. In this sentence, ""ki'o"" is a number representing 1000, ""spoja"" is a verb meaning ""to explode,"" ""cu"" is a separator used to avoid ambiguity, ""mucti"" is an adjective meaning ""silent,"" ""la'e"" is a particle indicating that the following word refers to the referent of a name, and ""la djan"" is a name, which we can assume refers to a person named John.
4. Putting it all together, option (A) can be translated as ""1000 explosions are silently happening to John.""
5. Now let's look at option (B): ""mucti cu spoja djan. la ki'o la'e"" In this sentence, ""mucti"" and ""spoja"" are the same as in option (A), but the order is different.
6. ""djan"" is the name John without the ""la"" particle, which is incorrect in Lojban.
7. The rest of the sentence, ""la ki'o la'e,"" is not grammatically connected to the first part and does not make sense in this context.
8. Therefore, option (A) is the better answer because it is a grammatically correct and coherent sentence in Lojban, while option (B) contains errors and does not form a complete thought.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) le dapma cu fonxa fo'i
(B) fo'i cu fonxa dapma le

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying meaning accurately and unambiguously.
2. Let's analyze both options to see which one is valid and grammatical in Lojban.
3. Option (A) ""le dapma cu fonxa fo'i"" can be broken down as follows: - ""le dapma"" refers to ""the curse"" (le = the, dapma = curse) - ""cu"" is a separator that helps to avoid ambiguity in the sentence - ""fonxa"" is the verb ""to phone"" or ""to call"" - ""fo'i"" is a pronoun that refers back to a previously mentioned subject So, option (A) can be translated as ""The curse phones/calls it.""
4. Now, let's analyze option (B) ""fo'i cu fonxa dapma le"": - ""fo'i"" is the pronoun referring back to a previously mentioned subject - ""cu"" is the separator - ""fonxa"" is the verb ""to phone"" or ""to call"" - ""dapma"" is the noun ""curse"" - ""le"" is the article ""the"" Option (B) seems to be an attempt to convey the same meaning as option (A), but the word order is incorrect and ungrammatical in Lojban.
5. The correct structure for a Lojban sentence is ""subject-cu-verb-object,"" and option (B) does not follow this structure.
6. Therefore, the better answer is (A) ""le dapma cu fonxa fo'i"" because it follows the correct Lojban sentence structure and conveys a clear, unambiguous meaning.
7. Option (B) is incorrect and ungrammatical in Lojban, so you should choose option (A) as your answer.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) gusta djim. krixa zifre zabna pluka be prosa cfika cu nu le ku cakla la tabra le be'o
(B) le zifre krixa be le gusta zabna cfika cakla ku be'o tabra cu pluka nu prosa la djim.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the better answer, let's break down both options and analyze their grammatical structures.
2. (A) gusta djim. krixa zifre zabna pluka be prosa cfika cu nu le ku cakla la tabra le be'o (B) le zifre krixa be le gusta zabna cfika cakla ku be'o tabra cu pluka nu prosa la djim.
3. First, let's look at option (A).
4. The sentence begins with ""gusta djim,"" which is a simple and clear statement that translates to ""Jim's restaurant.""
5. The rest of the sentence, ""krixa zifre zabna pluka be prosa cfika cu nu le ku cakla la tabra le be'o,"" describes the restaurant in a more complex manner, but it is still grammatically correct.
6. It essentially says that the restaurant is a place where one can enjoy freedom, pleasantness, and the beauty of prose and chocolate while listening to the trumpet.
7. Now, let's examine option (B).
8. The sentence starts with ""le zifre krixa be le gusta zabna cfika cakla ku be'o tabra cu pluka nu prosa la djim.""
9. While this sentence may seem similar to option (A), there are some subtle differences that make it less grammatically correct.
10. For example, the use of ""be"" and ""be'o"" in this sentence is not as clear as in option (A), and the overall structure is less coherent.
11. In conclusion, while both options may appear to be valid Lojban sentences at first glance, option (A) is the better answer due to its clearer grammatical structure and more coherent meaning.
12. Option (B) may seem similar, but it contains subtle errors that make it less correct.
13. Therefore, I would recommend choosing option (A) as the correct answer.

2. (A) so ca li le so'e cribe fatne In this option, the word order is incorrect and does not follow the proper Lojban grammar rules.
3. ""so"" is a digit and should not be placed at the beginning of the sentence.
4. ""li"" is used to indicate a number, but it is misplaced in this sentence.
5. Additionally, ""le"" should be followed by a noun, but it is followed by ""so'e,"" which is a quantifier.

2. (A) la loras. le murta go'i minde cu fuzme di'u (B) le di'u cu go'i murta minde la fuzme loras.
3. First, let's look at (A).
4. The sentence begins with ""la loras,"" which is a proper noun referring to a specific entity named Loras.
5. Next, we have ""le murta go'i minde,"" which is a description of an action involving a curtain (murta) and a command (minde).
6. The ""go'i"" here is a pro-bridi that refers back to the previous bridi, which in this case is the action of Loras.
7. The ""cu"" is a separator that helps to clarify the relationship between the sumti (arguments) and the selbri (predicate).
8. Finally, ""fuzme di'u"" indicates that Loras is responsible for the action described in the sentence.
9. Now, let's examine (B).
10. The sentence starts with ""le di'u,"" which is an incorrect usage of ""di'u"" as it should be used as a pro-sumti, not as a sumti with ""le.""
11. Next, we have ""cu go'i murta minde,"" which is an attempt to describe an action involving a curtain and a command, but the structure is incorrect.
12. The ""go'i"" should come after ""murta"" and before ""minde"" to properly refer back to the previous bridi.
13. Lastly, ""la fuzme loras"" is an incorrect combination of sumti and selbri, as ""fuzme"" should be used as a selbri, not as a sumti with ""la.""
14. In conclusion, (A) is a grammatically correct Lojban sentence, while (B) contains several errors in its structure and usage of sumti and selbri.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu
(B) mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa

1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer and (B) is not, let's break down the structure and meaning of each sentence.
2. (A) terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu This sentence can be translated as ""I will be afraid of the event of resting on a pole in an unspecified manner.""
3. The structure of this sentence is as follows: - ""terpa"" means ""to be afraid"" - ""le nu"" introduces an event - ""vau"" is a terminator that closes the ""nu"" construct - ""vreta"" means ""to rest"" - ""zu'i"" is a placeholder for an unspecified manner - ""grana"" means ""pole"" - ""ba"" indicates future tense - ""mi"" means ""I"" - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the ""le nu"" construct - ""cu"" is a separator that clarifies the relationship between the verb and the object (B) mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa This sentence can be translated as ""I, in an unspecified manner, will be the event of a pole resting, and then be afraid.""

The structure of this sentence is as follows: - ""mi"" means ""I"" - ""zu'i"" is a placeholder for an unspecified manner - ""cu"" is a separator that clarifies the relationship between the verb and the object - ""nu"" introduces an event - ""le grana"" means ""the pole"" - ""ba"" indicates future tense - ""vreta"" means ""to rest"" - ""vau"" is a terminator that closes the ""nu"" construct - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the ""le nu"" construct - ""terpa"" means ""to be afraid"" As you can see, sentence (A) is a more coherent and logical statement, while sentence (B) has a confusing structure and does not convey a clear meaning.
5. In (A), the fear is clearly related to the event of resting on a pole, whereas in (B), the fear seems unrelated to the event and is mentioned only after the event of the pole resting.
6. Therefore, it is clear that (A) terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu is the better answer, as it is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence that conveys a clear meaning.
7. On the other hand, (B) mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa is not a valid Lojban sentence and does not convey a clear meaning.

Is Sentence 2 of the proposed solution correct or flawed?","The topic at issue is whether Sentence 2 of a proposed solution to a problem is correct or flawed. A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu
(B) mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer and (B) is not, let's break down the structure and meaning of each sentence.
2. (A) terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu This sentence can be translated as ""I will be afraid of the event of resting on a pole in an unspecified manner.""
3. The structure of this sentence is as follows: - ""terpa"" means ""to be afraid"" - ""le nu"" introduces an event - ""vau"" is a terminator that closes the ""nu"" construct - ""vreta"" means ""to rest"" - ""zu'i"" is a placeholder for an unspecified manner - ""grana"" means ""pole"" - ""ba"" indicates future tense - ""mi"" means ""I"" - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the ""le nu"" construct - ""cu"" is a separator that clarifies the relationship between the verb and the object (B) mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa This sentence can be translated as ""I, in an unspecified manner, will be the event of a pole resting, and then be afraid.""
4. The structure of this sentence is as follows: - ""mi"" means ""I"" - ""zu'i"" is a placeholder for an unspecified manner - ""cu"" is a separator that clarifies the relationship between the verb and the object - ""nu"" introduces an event - ""le grana"" means ""the pole"" - ""ba"" indicates future tense - ""vreta"" means ""to rest"" - ""vau"" is a terminator that closes the ""nu"" construct - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the ""le nu"" construct - ""terpa"" means ""to be afraid"" As you can see, sentence (A) is a more coherent and logical statement, while sentence (B) has a confusing structure and does not convey a clear meaning.
5. In (A), the fear is clearly related to the event of resting on a pole, whereas in (B), the fear seems unrelated to the event and is mentioned only after the event of the pole resting.
6. Therefore, it is clear that (A) terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu is the better answer, as it is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence that conveys a clear meaning.
7. On the other hand, (B) mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa is not a valid Lojban sentence and does not convey a clear meaning.

(A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan.
(B) fo fo'u cu cribe la .atlstan.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan. is the correct answer, we must first break down the structure of both sentences and analyze their grammatical components.
2. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""selbri"" (predicate) followed by ""sumti"" (arguments).
3. The word ""cu"" is used to separate the selbri from the sumti, ensuring that the sentence is grammatically correct.
4. Now, let's examine the two options: (A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan.
5. (B) fo fo'u cu cribe la .atlstan.
6. In option (A), ""cu"" is used correctly to separate the selbri ""fo'u cribe"" (meaning ""is a bear"") from the sumti ""fo la .atlstan."" (meaning ""in Atlanta"").
7. This sentence can be translated as ""There is a bear in Atlanta,"" which is a grammatically correct and coherent statement in Lojban.
8. On the other hand, option (B) has an incorrect placement of ""cu.""
9. The sentence starts with ""fo fo'u,"" which is not a valid selbri.
10. The correct selbri should be ""fo'u cribe,"" as in option (A).
11. Additionally, the placement of ""cu"" before ""cribe"" in option (B) disrupts the intended meaning of the sentence, making it ungrammatical and difficult to understand.
12. Therefore, it is clear that option (A) cu fo'u cribe fo la .atlstan. is the correct answer, as it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure and conveys a coherent meaning.
13. Option (B) fo fo'u cu cribe la .atlstan. is incorrect due to its improper use of ""cu"" and the resulting ungrammatical sentence structure.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's break down both options and see why (A) is a better answer than (B).
3. (A) senta clite le banli cu loi (B) le banli cu clite loi senta First, let's analyze option (A).
4. In this sentence, ""senta"" means ""layer,"" ""clite"" means ""polite,"" ""le banli"" means ""the great,"" and ""cu"" is a separator that helps to clarify the structure of the sentence.
5. ""loi"" is a quantifier that refers to the mass of something.
6. So, the sentence can be translated as ""A layer of politeness is in the mass of greatness.""
7. Now, let's look at option (B).
8. In this sentence, ""le banli"" means ""the great,"" ""cu"" is a separator, ""clite"" means ""polite,"" and ""loi senta"" means ""the mass of layers.""

2. (A) silna va ca noras. le sfofa jdice la (B) le va sfofa silna ca jdice la noras.
3. First, let's look at the structure of a typical Lojban sentence.
4. A Lojban sentence usually follows the pattern of ""sumti selbri sumti"", where ""sumti"" are the arguments and ""selbri"" is the relation between them.
5. In this case, we want to express that a certain sofa is salty, and this decision was made by Noras.
6. Now, let's examine option (A).
7. The first part, ""silna va ca noras"", seems to be an incomplete sentence.
8. ""silna"" means ""salty"" and ""noras"" is a name, but ""va"" and ""ca"" are not connecting them properly.
9. The second part, ""le sfofa jdice la"", is also incorrect because ""jdice"" means ""to decide"" and it is not properly connected to the rest of the sentence.
10. On the other hand, option (B) has a more coherent structure.
11. ""le va sfofa"" means ""that there sofa"", ""silna"" means ""salty"", ""ca"" is a tense marker indicating the present, ""jdice"" means ""to decide"", and ""la noras"" refers to the person named Noras.
12. So, the sentence can be translated as ""That sofa there is salty, as decided by Noras.""
13. As you can see, option (B) is a more grammatically correct and coherent sentence in Lojban, while option (A) is fragmented and does not convey the intended meaning.
14. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing (B) as the correct answer.

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) ko cu gutra fa ko'u.
2. This is because in Lojban, the verb comes before the subject.
3. Therefore, ""gutra"" (which means ""to enclose"") must come before ""ko'u"" (which means ""me"").
4. In option (B), ""ko'u"" comes before ""gutra"", which is grammatically incorrect in Lojban.
5. Additionally, the particle ""cu"" is used to separate the verb from the rest of the sentence, and it should come after ""ko"" in option (A).

2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3. (A) ni'o le ro vibna ku lidne pensi ko'u This sentence translates to ""Section: the all female precedes thinking her.""
4. The structure of this sentence is confusing and does not convey a clear meaning.
5. The use of ""ni'o"" as a section separator is unnecessary, and the placement of ""lidne"" (precede) and ""pensi"" (think) is not in the correct order for a grammatical Lojban sentence.
6. (B) ro ni'o pensi lidne vibna le ko'u ku This sentence translates to ""All section-thinkers precede females in her group.""
7. In this sentence, the structure is more coherent and follows the proper Lojban grammar.
8. ""ro"" (all) is used to quantify the ""ni'o pensi"" (section-thinkers), and ""lidne"" (precede) is correctly placed before ""vibna"" (female) to indicate the intended action.
9. The use of ""le ko'u ku"" (in her group) further clarifies the context of the sentence.

2. Let's analyze both options to see which one is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence.
3. Option (A) reads: ""la djan. cu se flira"" In this sentence, ""la djan."" refers to a specific person named John.

1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer and (B) is not, let's break down the grammar and structure of each option.
2. (A) ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje In this sentence, ""ko'a"" is a pronoun that refers to a previously mentioned object or person.
3. ""cu"" is a separator that helps to clarify the relationship between the subject and the predicate.
4. ""batke"" is a noun meaning ""button,"" and ""be"" is a preposition that introduces a modifier for the noun.
5. ""le kakne"" is a description meaning ""the capable one,"" and ""ku"" is a terminator that ends the description.
6. ""be'o"" is another terminator that ends the modifier introduced by ""be.""
7. Finally, ""se cinje"" is a verb phrase meaning ""is wrinkled.""
8. Putting it all together, the sentence (A) can be translated as ""The capable one's button is wrinkled.""
9. (B) se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku In this sentence, ""se"" is a conversion operator that swaps the first and second arguments of the following verb, but it is misplaced at the beginning of the sentence, causing confusion.
10. ""cu"" and ""be"" are used as in option (A), but their placement is incorrect.
11. ""cinje"" is the verb meaning ""to wrinkle,"" and ""kakne"" is an adjective meaning ""capable.""
12. ""le batke"" is a description meaning ""the button,"" and ""be'o"" and ""ku"" are terminators as in option (A).
13. Finally, ""ko'a"" is the pronoun as in option (A).
14. The sentence (B) is not grammatically correct due to the misplaced ""se"" and the incorrect placement of ""cu"" and ""be.""
15. It is difficult to derive a coherent meaning from this sentence.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) lo ve snada cu go'a
(B) ve snada cu lo go'a

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) ve snada cu lo go'a is the better answer, let's break down the components of each sentence.
2. (A) lo ve snada cu go'a (B) ve snada cu lo go'a In Lojban, ""lo"" is a determiner that means ""the thing(s) that really is(are)""; it is used to specify a particular object or objects.
3. ""ve snada"" means ""to succeed"" or ""to achieve"", and ""cu"" is a separator that is used to separate the subject from the predicate.
4. Finally, ""go'a"" is a pro-bridi that refers to the previous bridi (a bridi is a basic unit of meaning in Lojban, similar to a clause in English).
5. Now, let's analyze the structure of each sentence.
6. (A) lo ve snada cu go'a This sentence can be translated as ""The thing(s) that really is(are) succeeding is(are) the same as the previous bridi.""
7. However, this sentence is not grammatically correct because ""lo"" should be followed by a selbri (a predicate), not a sumti (an argument) like ""ve snada"".
8. This makes the sentence difficult to understand and parse.
9. (B) ve snada cu lo go'a This sentence can be translated as ""To succeed is the same as the thing(s) that really is(are) the previous bridi.""
10. In this sentence, ""ve snada"" is correctly used as a selbri, and ""lo go'a"" is correctly used as a sumti.
11. This sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning.
12. Therefore, the better answer is (B) ve snada cu lo go'a, as it is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning, while (A) lo ve snada cu go'a is not grammatically correct and is difficult to understand.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3. (A) lei ba stidi cu ckape pinca ko'a This sentence can be broken down as follows: - lei ba stidi: a group of future students - cu: a separator used to avoid ambiguity - ckape pinca: a dangerous urinal - ko'a: a pronoun referring to a previously mentioned entity The sentence seems to say that a group of future students is a dangerous urinal, which doesn't make much sense.
4. Additionally, the pronoun ""ko'a"" is not properly connected to any other part of the sentence, making it unclear what it refers to.
5. (B) stidi cu ko'a lei ckape ba pinca This sentence can be broken down as follows: - stidi: to study - cu: a separator used to avoid ambiguity - ko'a: a pronoun referring to a previously mentioned entity - lei ckape: a group of dangerous things - ba pinca: will urinate In this sentence, the structure is more coherent.

1. The correct answer is (A) ""loras. la se perli cu"".
2. This is because in Lojban, the subject comes before the predicate.
3. In (B) ""la loras. cu se perli"", the subject ""la loras"" comes after the predicate ""se perli"", which is grammatically incorrect in Lojban.
4. Additionally, ""la se perli"" in (A) is a valid Lojban construct meaning ""the pearl"", while ""cu"" is a necessary marker for indicating the predicate.

Proposed solution:
1. Ah, I see you're considering option (A) as the correct answer.
2. However, let me explain why (B) is actually the better choice here.
3. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
4. In option (A), ""le dapma cu fonxa fo'i"", the sentence structure is not quite right.
5. It translates to something like ""the curse is a phone of it"", which doesn't make much sense.
6. On the other hand, option (B) ""fo'i cu fonxa dapma le"" has a more logical structure.
7. In this case, ""fo'i"" is a pronoun that refers back to a previously mentioned object, ""cu"" is a separator that helps clarify the relationship between the subject and the verb, ""fonxa"" means ""phone"", ""dapma"" means ""curse"", and ""le"" is a definite article.
8. So, the sentence can be translated as ""it (the previously mentioned object) is a phone that curses the (specific object).""
9. This sentence structure is more in line with the rules of Lojban grammar and conveys a clearer meaning.

3. In (A), the verb ""terpa"" (fear) comes first, followed by the subject ""mi"" (I), and then the object ""grana"" (rod).
4. This is the correct order of the sentence structure in Lojban.
5. On the other hand, (B) has the subject ""mi"" (I) coming first, followed by the verb ""zu'i"" (like), and then the object ""le grana"" (the rod).
6. This is not the correct order of the sentence structure in Lojban, and therefore, (B) is not a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence.
7. So, the correct answer is (A) because it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure.

(A) lu jo'a la noras. kanla li'u kerfa le jbama
(B) kanla noras. jo'a jbama li'u la kerfa le lu

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer and (B) is not, let's break down the components of each option and analyze their grammatical structure in Lojban.
2. Option (A) reads: ""lu jo'a la noras. kanla li'u kerfa le jbama"" This can be translated as: ""Indeed, Nora's eye is a bomb's hair.""
3. Now let's break it down: - ""lu"" and ""li'u"" are quotation marks in Lojban, used to enclose a quote or a phrase.
4. - ""jo'a"" is a discursive particle that means ""indeed"" or ""in addition.""
5. - ""la noras."" refers to a person named Nora.
6. - ""kanla"" means ""eye.""
7. - ""kerfa"" means ""hair.""
8. - ""le jbama"" refers to a bomb.
9. As you can see, the sentence structure in option (A) is grammatically correct in Lojban, and the meaning is clear.
10. Now let's analyze option (B): ""kanla noras. jo'a jbama li'u la kerfa le lu"" This option is not grammatically correct in Lojban, and its meaning is unclear.
11. Here's why: - ""kanla noras."" is an incorrect combination of ""kanla"" (eye) and ""noras"" (Nora).
12. In Lojban, you need to use ""la"" before a name to indicate a person, as in ""la noras.""
13. - ""jo'a jbama"" is also incorrect, as ""jo'a"" should be used as a discursive particle, not directly attached to a noun like ""jbama"" (bomb).
14. - ""li'u la kerfa le lu"" is an incorrect use of quotation marks ""lu"" and ""li'u.""
15. They should enclose a quote or a phrase, but here they are placed around unrelated words.
16. In conclusion, option (A) is the correct answer because it is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning in Lojban.
17. Option (B) is incorrect due to its improper use of Lojban grammar and unclear meaning.
18. As a Lojban expert, I can assure you that choosing option (A) is the best decision.

3. In this sentence, ""so"" is a digit that means ""5"", ""ca"" is a time tense that means ""now"", ""li"" is a number article, ""le"" is a definite article, ""so'e"" is a digit that means ""most"", ""cribe"" is a verb that means ""to be a bear"", and ""fatne"" is a verb that means ""to reverse"".
4. Now, let's analyze the structure of option (A).
5. The sentence can be translated as ""5 now the-number the most bears reverse"".
6. Although this may seem a bit strange, it is a grammatically valid Lojban sentence.
7. The structure follows the rules of Lojban grammar, with the appropriate use of articles, digits, and verbs.
8. Now, let's examine option (B).
9. In this sentence, ""li"" is a number article, ""so"" is a digit that means ""5"", ""ca"" is a time tense that means ""now"", ""cribe"" is a verb that means ""to be a bear"", ""so'e"" is a digit that means ""most"", and ""le"" is a definite article, and ""fatne"" is a verb that means ""to reverse"".
10. The structure of option (B) can be translated as ""the-number 5 now bears most the reverse"".
11. This sentence is not grammatically valid in Lojban because the definite article ""le"" is misplaced, and the sentence structure is not coherent.
12. Therefore, based on the analysis of both options, it is clear that option (A) is the correct answer, as it is a grammatically valid Lojban sentence.
13. Option (B) is incorrect due to its improper sentence structure and misplaced definite article.

(A) pe'u. djan. do'u te sodva le kukte
(B) kukte pe'u. le djan. sodva do'u te

Proposed solution:
1. First, let me explain the structure of both sentences, so you can better understand why (B) is the correct answer.
2. (A) pe'u. djan. do'u te sodva le kukte This sentence can be broken down as follows: - pe'u: a polite request marker - djan: a name, ""John"" - do'u: an end marker for a vocative phrase - te sodva: a verb meaning ""to serve as a soda"" - le kukte: a noun phrase meaning ""the tasty one""
3. Now, let's look at (B) kukte pe'u. le djan. sodva do'u te This sentence can be broken down as follows: - kukte: an adjective meaning ""tasty"" - pe'u: a polite request marker - le djan: a noun phrase meaning ""the John"" - sodva: a noun meaning ""soda"" - do'u te: a verb phrase meaning ""to serve"" As you can see, the structure of (B) is more coherent and logical.
4. In (A), the polite request marker ""pe'u"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, which is not the correct position for it.
5. In (B), ""pe'u"" is placed after the adjective ""kukte,"" which makes more sense as it is modifying the verb phrase ""to serve.""
6. Additionally, in (A), the name ""djan"" is separated from the noun phrase ""le kukte"" by the end marker ""do'u,"" which is not grammatically correct.
7. In (B), ""le djan"" is correctly placed before the noun ""sodva,"" forming a coherent noun phrase.
8. Finally, the verb phrase ""te sodva"" in (A) is not as clear as the verb phrase ""do'u te"" in (B).
9. In (B), the verb ""to serve"" is clearly connected to the noun phrase ""the tasty John's soda,"" making the sentence more understandable.
10. In conclusion, (B) kukte pe'u. le djan. sodva do'u te is the better answer because it has a more logical structure, correct placement of the polite request marker, and a clearer verb phrase.
11. While (A) may appear similar, it contains several grammatical errors that make it an incorrect choice.

(A) la dembi noras. se cu fo'o
(B) fo'o cu se dembi la noras.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down both options and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. Option (A) reads: ""la dembi noras. se cu fo'o"" In this sentence, ""la dembi noras"" refers to a specific entity named ""dembis noras"".
3. The period indicates the end of the first part of the sentence.
4. The second part, ""se cu fo'o"", is a grammatical construction that indicates a certain relationship or action involving the previously mentioned entity.
5. In this case, it suggests that ""dembis noras"" is involved in a particular action or state.
6. Option (B) reads: ""fo'o cu se dembi la noras.""
7. In this sentence, ""fo'o"" is a placeholder for a missing or unspecified entity.
8. The ""cu"" is a separator that is used to avoid ambiguity, but in this case, it is misplaced and creates confusion.
9. The ""se dembi la noras"" part is an attempt to describe a relationship or action involving ""noras"", but the structure is incorrect and does not convey a clear meaning.
10. Now, let's compare the two options.

12. On the other hand, option (B) has a misplaced separator and an unclear structure that does not convey a clear meaning.
13. Therefore, it is evident that option (A) is the better answer, as it is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban.
14. Option (B) is incorrect due to its improper structure and lack of clarity.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) loras. la se perli cu
(B) la loras. cu se perli

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (A) is a better answer than (B).
3. (A) loras. la se perli cu (B) la loras. cu se perli First, let's break down the components of each sentence: - ""loras"" refers to the subject, which is a name or a noun.
4. - ""la"" is a particle that indicates the following word is a name.
5. - ""se perli"" is a verb phrase, where ""se"" is a particle that changes the order of the arguments in the verb, and ""perli"" is the verb itself.
6. - ""cu"" is a particle that separates the subject from the verb phrase.
7. Now, let's examine the structure of each sentence: (A) loras. la se perli cu In this sentence, the subject ""loras"" is followed by a period, which indicates a pause or a separation between the subject and the rest of the sentence.
8. This is a common practice in Lojban to avoid ambiguity.
9. Then, we have ""la se perli cu"", which is a valid verb phrase with the appropriate particles in the correct order.
10. (B) la loras. cu se perli In this sentence, the particle ""la"" is placed before the subject ""loras"", which is unnecessary and incorrect.
11. The period after ""loras"" is also misplaced, as it should be after the subject, not after the particle ""la"".
12. Finally, the verb phrase ""cu se perli"" has the particles in the wrong order, which can lead to confusion and misinterpretation.
13. Based on this analysis, it is clear that (A) loras. la se perli cu is a better answer than (B) la loras. cu se perli.
14. The structure of (A) is more consistent with the rules of Lojban grammar, and it conveys the intended meaning more effectively.
15. While (B) may appear similar, the incorrect placement of particles and the period make it a less accurate representation of valid, grammatical standard Lojban.

2. In Lojban, the verb always comes before the subject, so ""mucti cu spoja"" is the correct order for ""spoja cu mucti"" in option (A).
3. Additionally, ""ki'o spoja"" is not a valid Lojban phrase, as ""ki'o"" is a cmavo (a word used for grammatical purposes) and cannot be used as a noun or verb.
4. On the other hand, option (B) follows the correct sentence structure and uses valid Lojban words.
5. ""Mucti"" means ""much"" or ""many,"" ""spoja"" means ""explode,"" and ""djan"" means ""John.""

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) le go'i sepli drani cu pinca le milxe
(B) milxe go'i le drani le cu sepli pinca

Proposed solution:
1. Ah, I see you're considering option (A) as the correct answer.
2. However, let me explain why option (B) is actually the better choice.
3. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
4. In option (A), ""le go'i sepli drani cu pinca le milxe,"" the sentence structure is not as clear as it could be.
5. The phrase ""le go'i sepli drani"" seems to refer to a separate entity, while ""cu pinca le milxe"" appears to describe an action involving that entity.
6. This structure can lead to confusion and ambiguity in understanding the intended meaning.
7. On the other hand, option (B), ""milxe go'i le drani le cu sepli pinca,"" presents a more logical and clear structure.
8. The phrase ""milxe go'i"" sets the stage for the rest of the sentence, indicating that we are discussing something mild or gentle.
9. Then, ""le drani le cu sepli pinca"" provides a clear description of the action and the entities involved.
10. This structure allows for a more precise and unambiguous understanding of the intended meaning.
11. Furthermore, the use of ""go'i"" in option (B) serves as a useful shorthand, referring back to a previously mentioned concept or entity.
12. This can help to streamline communication and reduce redundancy in conversation.
13. In conclusion, while option (A) may appear to be a valid Lojban sentence at first glance, option (B) provides a clearer, more logical structure that better aligns with the principles of the Lojban language.
14. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing option (B) as the correct answer.

(A) ku ragve le sumji vlipa loras. la da'a prina mensi fenra
(B) la loras. da'a ragve prina mensi ku fenra sumji le vlipa

Proposed solution:
1. First, let's analyze both sentences to understand their structure and meaning.
2. (A) ku ragve le sumji vlipa loras. la da'a prina mensi fenra This sentence seems to be a mix of Lojban words and phrases, but it doesn't follow the proper grammatical structure.
3. The word ""ku"" is used incorrectly, and the sentence lacks the necessary structure to convey a clear meaning.
4. (B) la loras. da'a ragve prina mensi ku fenra sumji le vlipa This sentence, on the other hand, follows the correct Lojban grammar and structure.
5. It can be translated as ""Loras is beyond the powerful sum, and the remaining printed sisters are angry.""
6. While the meaning might seem a bit unusual, it is a valid and grammatical Lojban sentence.
7. Now, let's break down the sentence (B) to understand why it is the correct answer: - ""la loras."" is a proper Lojban name, meaning ""Loras.""
8. - ""da'a"" is a quantifier meaning ""the rest"" or ""the remaining.""
9. - ""ragve"" means ""beyond"" or ""on the other side of.""
10. - ""prina"" means ""printed"" or ""to print.""
11. - ""mensi"" means ""sister.""
12. - ""ku"" is used correctly here as a clause terminator.
13. - ""fenra"" means ""angry"" or ""to be angry.""
14. - ""sumji"" means ""sum"" or ""to add.""
15. - ""le vlipa"" is a valid Lojban phrase meaning ""the powerful.""
16. As you can see, sentence (B) follows the correct Lojban grammar and structure, making it the better answer.
17. Sentence (A) is a mix of Lojban words and phrases but lacks the proper structure to convey a clear meaning.

A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe
(B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the components of both options and analyze their grammatical structure in Lojban.
2. Option (A) - zu'i le xance pante ku plipe 1. zu'i - this word indicates a typical or representative example of something.
3. 2. le xance - this phrase means ""the hand"" (le = the, xance = hand).
4. 3. pante - this word means ""to protest"" or ""to complain"".
5. 4. ku - this word is an elidable terminator, used to mark the end of a noun phrase.
6. 5. plipe - this word means ""to jump"" or ""to leap"".
7. Now, let's analyze the structure of option (A).
8. The phrase ""zu'i le xance"" refers to a typical or representative example of a hand.
9. The word ""pante"" indicates that this hand is protesting or complaining.
10. The word ""ku"" marks the end of the noun phrase, and ""plipe"" indicates that the hand is jumping or leaping.
11. So, option (A) can be translated as ""A typical hand protests and jumps.""
12. Option (B) - ku zu'i xance plipe le pante 1. ku - as mentioned before, this word is an elidable terminator, used to mark the end of a noun phrase.
13. 2. zu'i - this word indicates a typical or representative example of something.
14. 3. xance - this word means ""hand"".
15. 4. plipe - this word means ""to jump"" or ""to leap"".
16. 5. le pante - this phrase means ""the protest"" or ""the complaint"" (le = the, pante = protest).
17. In option (B), the word ""ku"" is misplaced at the beginning of the sentence, which disrupts the grammatical structure of the phrase.
18. The correct structure should have ""ku"" after a noun phrase, not before it.
19. Additionally, the phrase ""le pante"" is separated from the rest of the sentence, making it unclear what the protest or complaint is referring to.
20. Based on this analysis, option (A) is grammatically correct and coherent in Lojban, while option (B) has structural issues that make it incorrect.
21. Therefore, the better answer is (A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3. (A) loras. lu ni'o fo'a se lanme mi'a li'u cradi This sentence can be broken down as follows: - loras: a name or a non-Lojban word - lu: start of a quotation - ni'o: paragraph separator - fo'a: pronoun referring to a previously mentioned sumti (noun-like element) - se: changes the order of sumti in a bridi (predicate-like element) - lanme: sheep - mi'a: first person plural pronoun, ""we"" or ""us"" - li'u: end of a quotation - cradi: radio The sentence seems to be a mix of unrelated words and lacks a clear structure.
4. It's difficult to extract a coherent meaning from it.
5.

6. It can be interpreted as ""We radio Loras. Sheep (quotation) (paragraph separator) (change order) (start of quotation) (pronoun).""
7. Although it's not a perfect Lojban sentence, it has a more logical structure than (A) and can be understood as an attempt to communicate something related to radio communication with Loras and sheep.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) lo ve snada cu go'a
(B) ve snada cu lo go'a

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) ve snada cu lo go'a is the better answer, let's break down the components of each sentence.
2. (A) lo ve snada cu go'a (B) ve snada cu lo go'a In Lojban, ""lo"" is a determiner that means ""the thing(s) that really is(are)""; it is used to specify a particular object or objects.
3. ""ve snada"" means ""to succeed"" or ""to achieve"", and ""cu"" is a separator that is used to separate the subject from the predicate.
4. Finally, ""go'a"" is a pro-bridi that refers to the previous bridi (a bridi is a basic unit of meaning in Lojban, similar to a clause in English).
5. Now, let's analyze the structure of each sentence.
6. (A) lo ve snada cu go'a This sentence can be translated as ""The thing(s) that really is(are) succeeding is(are) the same as the previous bridi.""
7. However, this sentence is not grammatically correct because ""lo"" should be followed by a selbri (a predicate), not a sumti (an argument) like ""ve snada"".
8. This makes the sentence difficult to understand and parse.
9. (B) ve snada cu lo go'a This sentence can be translated as ""To succeed is the same as the thing(s) that really is(are) the previous bridi.""
10. In this sentence, ""ve snada"" is correctly used as a selbri, and ""lo go'a"" is correctly used as a sumti.
11. This sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning.
12. Therefore, the better answer is (B) ve snada cu lo go'a, as it is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning, while (A) lo ve snada cu go'a is not grammatically correct and is difficult to understand.

Is Sentence 5 of the proposed solution correct or flawed?","The topic at issue is whether Sentence 5 of a proposed solution to a problem is correct or flawed. A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) lo ve snada cu go'a
(B) ve snada cu lo go'a

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) ve snada cu lo go'a is the better answer, let's break down the components of each sentence.
2. (A) lo ve snada cu go'a (B) ve snada cu lo go'a In Lojban, ""lo"" is a determiner that means ""the thing(s) that really is(are)""; it is used to specify a particular object or objects.
3. ""ve snada"" means ""to succeed"" or ""to achieve"", and ""cu"" is a separator that is used to separate the subject from the predicate.
4. Finally, ""go'a"" is a pro-bridi that refers to the previous bridi (a bridi is a basic unit of meaning in Lojban, similar to a clause in English).
5. Now, let's analyze the structure of each sentence.
6. (A) lo ve snada cu go'a This sentence can be translated as ""The thing(s) that really is(are) succeeding is(are) the same as the previous bridi.""
7. However, this sentence is not grammatically correct because ""lo"" should be followed by a selbri (a predicate), not a sumti (an argument) like ""ve snada"".
8. This makes the sentence difficult to understand and parse.
9. (B) ve snada cu lo go'a This sentence can be translated as ""To succeed is the same as the thing(s) that really is(are) the previous bridi.""
10. In this sentence, ""ve snada"" is correctly used as a selbri, and ""lo go'a"" is correctly used as a sumti.
11. This sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning.
12. Therefore, the better answer is (B) ve snada cu lo go'a, as it is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning, while (A) lo ve snada cu go'a is not grammatically correct and is difficult to understand.

(A) la dembi noras. se cu fo'o
(B) fo'o cu se dembi la noras.

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) ""la dembi noras. se cu fo'o"".
2. This is because in Lojban, the subject comes before the predicate, and the verb ""se"" indicates that the subject is the receiver of the action.
3. Therefore, ""la dembi"" is the subject and ""noras"" is the predicate.
4. Additionally, ""cu"" is used to separate the subject and predicate in Lojban sentences.
5. On the other hand, (B) ""fo'o cu se dembi la noras"" is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
6. The word ""fo'o"" is not a valid Lojban word, and the word order is incorrect.
7. The subject should come before the predicate, so ""la noras"" should come before ""se dembi"".

2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is the better answer.
3. (A) ko cu gutra fa ko'u This sentence can be broken down as follows: - ""ko"" is a pro-sumti, which stands for ""you"" or the person being addressed.
4. - ""cu"" is a separator, used to avoid ambiguity between the sumti (arguments) and the selbri (predicate).
5. - ""gutra"" is the Lojban word for ""bed.""

(B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante is the better answer, let's break down the components of both sentences and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""selbri"" (predicate) followed by ""sumti"" (arguments).
3. The selbri is the core of the sentence, describing the relationship between the sumti.
4. (A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe In this sentence, ""zu'i"" is a sumti, meaning ""the typical value"" or ""as expected.""
5. ""Le xance pante"" translates to ""the hand pants,"" which is an unusual combination of words.
6. ""Ku"" is an elidable terminator, used to mark the end of a construct.
7. Finally, ""plipe"" is a selbri, meaning ""to jump"" or ""to leap.""
8. The issue with this sentence is that the selbri ""plipe"" comes at the end, after the sumti and the terminator ""ku.""
9. This is not a valid Lojban sentence structure, as the selbri should come before the sumti.
10. (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante In this sentence, ""ku"" is again an elidable terminator, but its placement at the beginning of the sentence is more appropriate.
11. ""Zu'i"" is still a sumti, and ""xance plipe"" now functions as a selbri, meaning ""to jump with the hand.""
12. Finally, ""le pante"" translates to ""the pants.""
13. This sentence structure is more grammatically correct in Lojban, as the selbri ""xance plipe"" comes before the sumti ""le pante.""
14. The sentence can be interpreted as ""As expected, the hand jumps with the pants,"" which, while still unusual, is a valid Lojban sentence.
15. Therefore, (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante is the better answer, as it follows the correct Lojban sentence structure.
16. While (A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe may seem similar, its incorrect placement of the selbri makes it an invalid Lojban sentence.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ku se ka vau kei stela le tunba steba
(B) le ka stela vau kei se steba ku tunba

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the structure of both sentences and analyze their grammatical components.
2. (A) ku se ka vau kei stela le tunba steba (B) le ka stela vau kei se steba ku tunba First, let's look at (A).
3. The structure of this sentence is as follows: - ""ku"" is a terminator that closes a previous construct, which is not present in this sentence, but it can be used for emphasis or clarity.
4. - ""se"" is a conversion operator that swaps the first and second places of the following predicate.
5. - ""ka"" is an abstractor that creates a property from the following predicate.
6. - ""vau"" is an end-of-sumti marker, which indicates the end of a noun phrase.
7. - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the abstraction started by ""ka"".
8. - ""stela"" is a predicate meaning ""to lock"" or ""to be a lock"".
9. - ""le"" is an article that refers to a specific instance of the following predicate.
10. - ""tunba"" is a predicate meaning ""sibling"".
11. - ""steba"" is a predicate meaning ""to be frustrated"" or ""to be angry"".
12. Now, let's analyze (B): - ""le"" is an article that refers to a specific instance of the following predicate.
13. - ""ka"" is an abstractor that creates a property from the following predicate.
14. - ""stela"" is a predicate meaning ""to lock"" or ""to be a lock"".
15. - ""vau"" is an end-of-sumti marker, which indicates the end of a noun phrase.
16. - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the abstraction started by ""ka"".
17. - ""se"" is a conversion operator that swaps the first and second places of the following predicate.
18. - ""steba"" is a predicate meaning ""to be frustrated"" or ""to be angry"".
19. - ""ku"" is a terminator that closes a previous construct, which is not present in this sentence, but it can be used for emphasis or clarity.
20. - ""tunba"" is a predicate meaning ""sibling"".
21. Now that we have analyzed both sentences, it is clear that (A) is the better answer.
22. The structure of (A) allows for a more coherent and logical interpretation, as it can be translated to something like ""The property of locking is frustrated by the sibling.""
23. In contrast, (B) has a less clear structure and meaning, as the conversion operator ""se"" is placed after the abstraction terminator ""kei"", which makes the sentence difficult to interpret.
24. Furthermore, the use of ""ku"" in (A) adds emphasis to the sentence, while its placement in (B) is less effective.
25. Overall, (A) is a more grammatically sound and meaningful sentence in Lojban, making it the better answer choice.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) is the better answer, let's first break down the components of each sentence.
2. (A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko (B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""sumti selbri sumti"", where ""sumti"" are the arguments and ""selbri"" is the relation between them.
3. In both sentences, ""le jukpa"" is a sumti, which refers to ""the cook"" or ""the one who is cooking"".
4. The word ""broda"" is a placeholder verb, which can represent any action or relation.
5. The word ""ko"" is an imperative command, instructing the listener to do something.
6. Now, let's analyze the differences between the two sentences.
7. In sentence (A), ""cu"" is used to separate the sumti ""le jukpa"" from the selbri ""broda"".
8. However, the placement of ""fi"" before ""ko"" is incorrect, as ""fi"" is a preposition that should be followed by a sumti, not a command like ""ko"".
9. This makes sentence (A) ungrammatical.
10. On the other hand, sentence (B) has a different structure.
11. The word ""fi"" is followed by ""cu"", which is an unusual but valid construction.
12. In this case, ""fi cu"" acts as a preposition that introduces a new sumti, which is ""le jukpa"".
13. The selbri ""broda"" then follows, and the sentence ends with the command ""ko"".
14. This structure is grammatical and conveys the intended meaning: ""Do the action (broda) with the cook (le jukpa).""
15. Therefore, based on the grammatical structure and the intended meaning, the correct answer is (B) ""fi cu le jukpa broda ko"".
16. While this may not be the most common way to express this idea in Lojban, it is still a valid and grammatical construction.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) mi'o doi meris. ba jemna
(B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's break down both options to see why (A) is the better answer.
3. (A) mi'o doi meris. ba jemna (B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris.
4. In both sentences, ""mi'o"" means ""we"" and ""doi"" is a vocative marker, which is used to address someone.
5. In this case, we are addressing someone named either ""meris"" or ""jemna.""
6. Now, let's look at the second part of each sentence.
7. In (A), ""ba jemna"" means ""will compete,"" with ""ba"" indicating a future tense and ""jemna"" meaning ""compete.""
8. In (B), ""jemna ba meris"" seems to suggest that ""jemna"" is the name being addressed, and ""ba meris"" would mean ""will Meris,"" which is not a complete thought or grammatically correct in Lojban.
9. So, based on the structure and grammar of Lojban, (A) ""mi'o doi meris. ba jemna"" is the better answer, as it translates to ""We, Meris, will compete.""
10. On the other hand, (B) ""mi'o doi jemna ba meris."" does not convey a complete thought and is not grammatically correct in Lojban.

8. In (B), ""jemna ba meris"" seems to suggest that ""jemna"" is the name being addressed, and ""ba meris"" would mean ""will Meris,"" which is not a complete thought or grammatically correct in Lojban.
9. So, based on the structure and grammar of Lojban, (A) ""mi'o doi meris. ba jemna"" is the better answer, as it translates to ""We, Meris, will compete.""
10. On the other hand, (B) ""mi'o doi jemna ba meris."" does not convey a complete thought and is not grammatically correct in Lojban.

2. (A) le go'i sepli drani cu pinca le milxe This sentence can be translated as ""The thing which is separated correctly is mildly spicy.""
3. Here, ""le go'i"" refers to the thing being discussed, ""sepli"" means separated, ""drani"" means correctly, ""cu"" is a separator between the subject and the predicate, ""pinca"" means spicy, and ""le milxe"" means mildly.
4. (B) milxe go'i le drani le cu sepli pinca This sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
5. The main issue is the placement of ""cu"" in the sentence.
6. In Lojban, ""cu"" is used to separate the subject from the predicate, but in this sentence, it is placed incorrectly, causing confusion in the sentence structure.
7. Now, let's analyze the grammar and structure of both sentences.
8. In sentence (A), the structure is clear and follows the standard Lojban grammar rules.
9. The subject is ""le go'i sepli drani,"" which is a noun phrase that describes the thing being discussed.

4. The structure of this sentence is confusing and does not convey a clear meaning.

7. In this sentence, the structure is more coherent and follows the proper Lojban grammar.

(A) goi li pa cu merli di'u
(B) di'u goi li pa cu merli

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's break down both options to see why (A) is the better answer.
3. (A) goi li pa cu merli di'u (B) di'u goi li pa cu merli In Lojban, ""goi"" is a pro-sumti, which is used to assign a temporary name or label to a sumti (a noun-like argument).
4. In this case, ""li pa"" is the sumti, which represents the number one.
5. So, ""goi li pa"" is essentially labeling the number one for reference later in the sentence.
6. Next, we have ""cu,"" which is a separator used to clarify the relationship between the selbri (verb-like predicate) and the sumti.
7. In both options, ""cu"" is correctly placed between the sumti ""li pa"" and the selbri ""merli.""
8. The selbri ""merli"" means ""to measure"" or ""to count.""
9. So far, both options have the same structure: ""goi li pa cu merli,"" which can be translated as ""label the number one and measure/count it.""
10. Now, let's look at the final word in each option: ""di'u.""
11. This word is a pro-bridi, which refers back to the previous bridi (a complete predicate-argument structure).
12. In option (A), ""di'u"" comes after ""merli,"" which means it refers back to the entire bridi ""goi li pa cu merli.""
13. This makes sense, as it emphasizes the action of measuring or counting the number one.
14. In option (B), however, ""di'u"" is placed before ""goi li pa cu merli.""
15. This placement is problematic because it suggests that the reference to the previous bridi should be inserted before the current bridi, which disrupts the sentence structure and creates confusion.
16. Therefore, option (A) ""goi li pa cu merli di'u"" is the better answer, as it maintains the correct sentence structure and conveys the intended meaning.
17. Option (B) ""di'u goi li pa cu merli"" is incorrect due to the misplaced ""di'u"" causing confusion in the sentence structure.

8. The selbri ""merli"" means ""to measure"" or ""to count.""
9. So far, both options have the same structure: ""goi li pa cu merli,"" which can be translated as ""label the number one and measure/count it.""
10. Now, let's look at the final word in each option: ""di'u.""
11. This word is a pro-bridi, which refers back to the previous bridi (a complete predicate-argument structure).
12. In option (A), ""di'u"" comes after ""merli,"" which means it refers back to the entire bridi ""goi li pa cu merli.""
13. This makes sense, as it emphasizes the action of measuring or counting the number one.
14. In option (B), however, ""di'u"" is placed before ""goi li pa cu merli.""
15. This placement is problematic because it suggests that the reference to the previous bridi should be inserted before the current bridi, which disrupts the sentence structure and creates confusion.
16. Therefore, option (A) ""goi li pa cu merli di'u"" is the better answer, as it maintains the correct sentence structure and conveys the intended meaning.
17. Option (B) ""di'u goi li pa cu merli"" is incorrect due to the misplaced ""di'u"" causing confusion in the sentence structure.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) loras. panra lo mensi cu le mi vlipa pinca coi. se ba
(B) ba mi le vlipa cu pinca se panra lo mensi coi. loras.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down both options and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. (A) loras. panra lo mensi cu le mi vlipa pinca coi. se ba (B) ba mi le vlipa cu pinca se panra lo mensi coi. loras.
3. First, let's look at option (A).
4. The sentence begins with ""loras,"" which is a valid Lojban name.
5. Then, we have ""panra lo mensi,"" which means ""comparing to a sister.""
6. Next, we have ""cu,"" which is a separator used to avoid ambiguity.
7. Following that, we have ""le mi vlipa pinca,"" which translates to ""my powerful pinch.""
8. Finally, we have ""coi,"" which is a greeting, and ""se ba,"" which is a valid Lojban grammatical construct.
9. Now, let's examine option (B).
10. The sentence begins with ""ba,"" which is a future tense marker, followed by ""mi,"" which means ""I"" or ""me.""
11. Then, we have ""le vlipa cu pinca,"" which translates to ""the powerful pinch.""
12. However, the use of ""cu"" here is incorrect, as it should be placed before ""pinca"" to avoid ambiguity.
13. Next, we have ""se panra lo mensi,"" which means ""compared to a sister,"" but the use of ""se"" here is incorrect, as it should be placed before ""panra.""
14. Finally, we have ""coi"" and ""loras,"" which are a greeting and a name, respectively.
15. Based on this analysis, it is clear that option (A) is a better answer than option (B), as it has a more valid and grammatical structure in Lojban.
16. While option (B) may appear to be correct at first glance, the incorrect placement of ""cu"" and ""se"" makes it an invalid choice.
17. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing option (A) as the correct answer.

2. (A) lo bruna klupe sepli le tabra .uo cu (B) .uo lo tabra cu sepli le klupe bruna First, let's look at (A).
3. The sentence structure is as follows: - ""lo bruna klupe"" refers to ""the brown wrench"" - ""sepli"" is a verb meaning ""to be separate from"" - ""le tabra"" refers to ""the trumpet"" - "".uo"" is an attitudinal indicator expressing happiness or approval - ""cu"" is a separator used to avoid ambiguity in the sentence structure Now, let's analyze (B): - "".uo"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, which is an unusual position for an attitudinal indicator - ""lo tabra"" refers to ""the trumpet"" - ""cu"" is used as a separator, but its placement here is unnecessary and creates confusion - ""sepli"" is the verb ""to be separate from"" - ""le klupe bruna"" refers to ""the brown wrench"", but the adjective ""bruna"" is misplaced, making the sentence structure awkward Based on this analysis, it is clear that (A) is a better answer than (B) because it has a more coherent and grammatically correct structure.
4. The placement of the attitudinal indicator "".uo"" and the separator ""cu"" in (B) creates confusion and disrupts the flow of the sentence.

(B) le vi rinka cu bruna cumla lu lakne ko'u le jelca jatna li'u

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why option (B) is the correct answer, let's first analyze both options and see how they differ in terms of grammar and structure.
2. Option (A): jelca le ko'u lakne cumla bruna li'u jatna cu rinka vi le lu Option (B): le vi rinka cu bruna cumla lu lakne ko'u le jelca jatna li'u First, let's break down the components of each option: (A) jelca (burn) le ko'u (the x1) lakne (probable) cumla (humble) bruna (brother) li'u (quote) jatna (leader) cu (sumti separator) rinka (cause) vi (here) le lu (the x2) (B) le vi rinka (the x1 cause) cu (sumti separator) bruna (brother) cumla (humble) lu (quote) lakne (probable) ko'u (the x2) le jelca (the burn) jatna (leader) li'u (quote) Now, let's analyze the grammar and structure of each option: In option (A), the sentence starts with ""jelca,"" which is a verb meaning ""burn.""
3. However, in Lojban, sentences should start with a sumti (noun phrase) followed by a selbri (verb phrase).
4. This makes option (A) grammatically incorrect.
5. On the other hand, option (B) starts with ""le vi rinka,"" which is a sumti (noun phrase) meaning ""the cause here.""
6. This is followed by ""cu,"" which is a sumti separator, and then ""bruna cumla,"" another sumti (noun phrase) meaning ""humble brother.""
7. The sentence then continues with ""lu,"" which is a quote marker, followed by ""lakne ko'u,"" a sumti (noun phrase) meaning ""the probable x2.""
8. Finally, the sentence ends with ""le jelca jatna li'u,"" which is a selbri (verb phrase) meaning ""the burning leader.""

(B) stidi cu ko'a lei ckape ba pinca

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (A) is the better answer.
3. (A) lei ba stidi cu ckape pinca ko'a In this sentence, we have the following components: - ""lei ba stidi"" refers to a group of things that will study in the future.
4. - ""cu"" is a separator that helps to clarify the structure of the sentence.
5. - ""ckape pinca"" is a compound term that refers to a dangerous fish.
6. - ""ko'a"" is a pronoun that refers to a previously mentioned entity.
7. Putting it all together, this sentence can be translated as ""The group of future students is a dangerous fish to him/her/it.""
8. (B) stidi cu ko'a lei ckape ba pinca In this sentence, we have the following components: - ""stidi"" refers to the act of studying.
9. - ""cu"" is a separator, as mentioned before.
10. - ""ko'a"" is the pronoun, referring to a previously mentioned entity.
11. - ""lei ckape ba pinca"" is a group of dangerous fish that will exist in the future.
12. However, the structure of this sentence is problematic.
13. The intended meaning is unclear, as it could be interpreted as ""Studying is him/her/it to the group of future dangerous fish"" or ""Studying is the group of future dangerous fish to him/her/it.""
14. The sentence is ambiguous and does not follow proper Lojban grammar.
15. Therefore, (A) is the better answer because it has a clear structure and meaning, while (B) is ambiguous and grammatically incorrect.
16. As a Lojban expert, I strongly recommend choosing (A) as the correct answer.

8. (B) stidi cu ko'a lei ckape ba pinca In this sentence, we have the following components: - ""stidi"" refers to the act of studying.
9. - ""cu"" is a separator, as mentioned before.
10. - ""ko'a"" is the pronoun, referring to a previously mentioned entity.
11. - ""lei ckape ba pinca"" is a group of dangerous fish that will exist in the future.
12. However, the structure of this sentence is problematic.
13. The intended meaning is unclear, as it could be interpreted as ""Studying is him/her/it to the group of future dangerous fish"" or ""Studying is the group of future dangerous fish to him/her/it.""
14. The sentence is ambiguous and does not follow proper Lojban grammar.
15. Therefore, (A) is the better answer because it has a clear structure and meaning, while (B) is ambiguous and grammatically incorrect.
16. As a Lojban expert, I strongly recommend choosing (A) as the correct answer.

(A) mi'o cu traji jursa la loras.
(B) traji la cu loras. jursa mi'o

Proposed solution:
1. I understand that you might be inclined to choose option (A) as the correct answer, but let me explain why option (B) is actually the better choice.
2. First, let's break down the two sentences: (A) mi'o cu traji jursa la loras. (B) traji la cu loras.
3. jursa mi'o In Lojban, the word order is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
4. In option (A), the word order is ""mi'o cu traji jursa la loras,"" which translates to ""We are the most just towards Loras.""
5. However, this sentence structure is not the most efficient way to convey this idea in Lojban.
6. On the other hand, option (B) has a more logical word order: ""traji la cu loras. jursa mi'o.""
7. This sentence can be translated as ""The most just is Loras. Towards us.""
8. This structure is more in line with the principles of Lojban, as it separates the two ideas into distinct sentences, making it easier to understand and process.
9. Furthermore, option (A) uses the word ""cu"" in an unnecessary manner.
10. In Lojban, ""cu"" is used to separate the subject from the predicate when there is a potential ambiguity.
11. However, in this case, there is no ambiguity, so the use of ""cu"" is redundant and makes the sentence less efficient.
12. In conclusion, option (B) is the better answer because it adheres more closely to the principles of Lojban, has a more logical word order, and avoids unnecessary redundancy.
13. While option (A) may appear to be correct at first glance, a deeper understanding of Lojban reveals that option (B) is the superior choice.

3. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.

5. It translates to something like ""the curse is a phone of it"", which doesn't make much sense.
6. On the other hand, option (B) ""fo'i cu fonxa dapma le"" has a more logical structure.
7. In this case, ""fo'i"" is a pronoun that refers back to a previously mentioned object, ""cu"" is a separator that helps clarify the relationship between the subject and the verb, ""fonxa"" means ""phone"", ""dapma"" means ""curse"", and ""le"" is a definite article.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le
(B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is the better answer.
3. (A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le This sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
4. The structure is confusing and does not follow the standard subject-predicate-object format.
5. ""panje"" is a number (five), ""pu"" is a tense marker (past), ""xanka"" is a verb (to be nervous), ""cu"" is a separator, ""surla"" is a verb (to relax), ""loi"" is a quantifier, and ""le"" is an article.
6. The sentence seems to be trying to convey something about five past nervousness and relaxation, but it is not clear what the intended meaning is.
7. (B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka This sentence is grammatically correct in Lojban.
8. It follows the standard subject-predicate-object format.
9. ""le surla"" (the relaxation) is the subject, ""cu"" is the separator, ""panje"" (five) is the predicate, ""pu"" is the tense marker (past), and ""loi xanka"" (a group of nervousness) is the object.
10. The sentence can be translated as ""The relaxation was five past nervousness,"" which, although it may sound a bit odd in English, is a valid Lojban sentence.
11. Therefore, (B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka is the better answer because it is a grammatically correct Lojban sentence, while (A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le is not.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la djan. cu se flira
(B) djan. la cu flira se

Proposed solution:
1. Ah, I see you're considering option (A) as the correct answer.
2. However, let me explain why (B) is actually the better choice here.
3. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is quite flexible, but there are certain rules that must be followed.
4. In option (A), ""la djan. cu se flira,"" the sentence starts with ""la,"" which is used to indicate a proper noun, followed by ""djan,"" which is the name John.
5. Then, ""cu"" is used as a separator between the name and the rest of the sentence.
6. Finally, ""se flira"" is a verb phrase that means ""to be beautiful.""
7. Now, let's look at option (B), ""djan. la cu flira se.""
8. In this sentence, we still have ""djan"" as the name John, and ""se flira"" as the verb phrase meaning ""to be beautiful.""
9. However, the placement of ""la"" and ""cu"" is different.
10. In this case, ""la"" is placed after ""djan,"" and ""cu"" is placed before ""flira se.""
11. This change in placement actually emphasizes the name John and the action of being beautiful, making the sentence more focused on the subject and the action.
12. While both sentences convey the same meaning, option (B) is more effective in emphasizing the subject and the action, making it a better choice in terms of Lojban grammar and style.
13. So, I would recommend choosing option (B) as the correct answer.

(A) ko'o fi le canre cu zabna
(B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu.
2. Let me explain why.
3. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure is Subject-Verb-Object, just like in English.
4. However, Lojban also allows for the use of sumti, which are words that act as nouns or adjectives in a sentence.
5. In this case, ""fi le canre"" and ""fi zabna"" are both sumti.
6. Now, let's look at option (A) ko'o fi le canre cu zabna.
7. This sentence is grammatically correct, but it is not the best option.
8. The word ""fi"" should be used to connect the sumti to the verb ""zabna"", but it is missing in this sentence.
9. Instead, ""le"" is used, which is not the correct way to connect sumti to the verb.
10. On the other hand, option (B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu is the correct way to use sumti in Lojban.

12. This makes the sentence grammatically correct and the best option.
13. So, in conclusion, the correct answer is (B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu.

(A) ko'o fi le canre cu zabna
(B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying meaning accurately and unambiguously.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (A) is the better answer.
3. (A) ko'o fi le canre cu zabna (B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu First, let's break down the components of each sentence: - ko'o: a pro-sumti, which is a pronoun-like word that stands for a previously mentioned sumti (noun-like word).
4. - fi: a preposition-like word that marks the place structure of a selbri (verb-like word).
5. #NAME?
6. - canre: a gismu (root word) that means ""sand.""
7. #NAME?
8. - zabna: a gismu that means ""good"" or ""favorable.""
9. Now, let's examine the structure of each sentence: (A) ko'o fi le canre cu zabna This sentence can be translated as ""For ko'o, the sand is good.""
10. The structure is as follows: - ko'o: the pro-sumti referring to a previously mentioned noun-like word.
11. #NAME?
12. - le canre: the sumti, meaning ""the sand.""
13. #NAME?
14. - zabna: the selbri, meaning ""good"" or ""favorable.""
15. (B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu This sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban, as the structure is jumbled and unclear.
16. The intended meaning is difficult to discern, and the placement of ""fi"" and ""cu"" creates confusion.
17. In conclusion, option (A) is the better answer because it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure, ensuring that the meaning is clear and unambiguous.

2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is the better answer.
3. (A) ko cu gutra fa ko'u This sentence can be broken down as follows: - ""ko"" is a pro-sumti, which stands for ""you"" or the person being addressed.
4. - ""cu"" is a separator, used to avoid ambiguity between the sumti (arguments) and the selbri (predicate).
5. - ""gutra"" is the Lojban word for ""bed.""

2. This sentence follows the correct word order in Lojban: descriptor, selbri, sumti.
3. In this case, the descriptor is ""zu'i le xance pante"" (meaning ""the jumping pants""), the selbri is ""plipe"" (meaning ""jump""), and the sumti is ""ku"" (which acts as a separator).
4. On the other hand, option (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante is not grammatically correct because the sumti ""ku"" should come after the selbri, not before it.

(A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe
(B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the components of both options and analyze their grammatical structure in Lojban.
2. Option (A) - zu'i le xance pante ku plipe 1. zu'i - this word indicates a typical or representative example of something.
3. 2. le xance - this phrase means ""the hand"" (le = the, xance = hand).
4. 3. pante - this word means ""to protest"" or ""to complain"".
5. 4. ku - this word is an elidable terminator, used to mark the end of a noun phrase.
6. 5. plipe - this word means ""to jump"" or ""to leap"".
7. Now, let's analyze the structure of option (A).
8. The phrase ""zu'i le xance"" refers to a typical or representative example of a hand.
9. The word ""pante"" indicates that this hand is protesting or complaining.
10. The word ""ku"" marks the end of the noun phrase, and ""plipe"" indicates that the hand is jumping or leaping.
11. So, option (A) can be translated as ""A typical hand protests and jumps.""
12. Option (B) - ku zu'i xance plipe le pante 1. ku - as mentioned before, this word is an elidable terminator, used to mark the end of a noun phrase.
13. 2. zu'i - this word indicates a typical or representative example of something.
14. 3. xance - this word means ""hand"".
15. 4. plipe - this word means ""to jump"" or ""to leap"".
16. 5. le pante - this phrase means ""the protest"" or ""the complaint"" (le = the, pante = protest).
17. In option (B), the word ""ku"" is misplaced at the beginning of the sentence, which disrupts the grammatical structure of the phrase.
18. The correct structure should have ""ku"" after a noun phrase, not before it.
19. Additionally, the phrase ""le pante"" is separated from the rest of the sentence, making it unclear what the protest or complaint is referring to.
20. Based on this analysis, option (A) is grammatically correct and coherent in Lojban, while option (B) has structural issues that make it incorrect.
21. Therefore, the better answer is (A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe.

2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3. (A) ni'o le ro vibna ku lidne pensi ko'u This sentence translates to ""Section: the all female precedes thinking her.""
4. The structure of this sentence is confusing and does not convey a clear meaning.
5. The use of ""ni'o"" as a section separator is unnecessary, and the placement of ""lidne"" (precede) and ""pensi"" (think) is not in the correct order for a grammatical Lojban sentence.
6. (B) ro ni'o pensi lidne vibna le ko'u ku This sentence translates to ""All section-thinkers precede females in her group.""
7. In this sentence, the structure is more coherent and follows the proper Lojban grammar.
8. ""ro"" (all) is used to quantify the ""ni'o pensi"" (section-thinkers), and ""lidne"" (precede) is correctly placed before ""vibna"" (female) to indicate the intended action.

Proposed solution:
1. First, let me explain the basic structure of a Lojban sentence.
2. In Lojban, the subject comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object.
3. Additionally, Lojban uses specific particles to indicate the relationships between words and phrases.

A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la djim. pu xance la dikca loras.
(B) pu la loras. xance dikca la djim.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down both sentences and analyze their grammatical structure. (A) la djim. pu xance la dikca loras. (B) pu la loras. xance dikca la djim.
2. First, let's look at the structure of a basic Lojban sentence.
3. A typical Lojban sentence follows the pattern: subject (sumti) - verb (selbri) - object (sumti).
4. In both sentences, ""la djim"" and ""la loras"" are the subjects, and ""la dikca loras"" and ""la djim"" are the objects, respectively.
5. Now, let's examine the verbs and the tense markers.
6. In (A), ""pu"" is a tense marker indicating past tense, and ""xance"" is the verb meaning ""to touch"" or ""to be in contact with.""
7. In (B), ""pu"" is again the tense marker for past tense, but it is placed before the subject, which is not the correct position for a tense marker in Lojban.
8. The verb ""xance"" is also present in (B), but it is followed by ""dikca,"" which means ""electric"" or ""electrical.""
9. This creates a grammatical error, as ""dikca"" should be placed before ""xance"" to form a compound verb meaning ""to touch electrically.""
10. Therefore, the correct sentence structure should be: (A) la djim. pu xance la dikca loras.
11. (Jim touched the electric Loras in the past.)
12. (B) *pu la loras. xance dikca la djim.
13. (Incorrect sentence structure) As you can see, (A) follows the proper Lojban sentence structure and uses the correct tense marker and verb placement.
14. On the other hand, (B) has an incorrect placement of the tense marker and an incorrect verb order.
15. Thus, (A) is the better answer, and (B) is wrong.
16. I hope this explanation helps you understand why (A) is the correct choice.
17. Remember, Lojban is a logical language, and its grammar rules are designed to be consistent and unambiguous.
18. By following these rules, you can be confident in your understanding of the language and your ability to communicate effectively in Lojban.

2. (A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le (B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka First, let's look at option (A).
3. In this sentence, ""panje"" is the verb, meaning ""to spread"" or ""to extend.""
4. ""Pu"" is a tense marker indicating past time, and ""xanka"" is the object being spread, which can be translated as ""nervousness"" or ""anxiety.""
5. The particle ""cu"" separates the verb from the following predicate, ""surla,"" which means ""to relax.""
6. Finally, ""loi le"" is a quantifier that can be translated as ""some of the.""
7. Now, let's analyze option (B).
8. In this sentence, ""le surla"" is a noun phrase meaning ""the relaxation.""
9. The particle ""cu"" separates the noun phrase from the verb ""panje,"" which, as mentioned earlier, means ""to spread"" or ""to extend.""

1. The correct answer is (A) pe'u. djan. do'u te sodva le kukte.
2. This is because in Lojban, the verb comes first in a sentence, followed by the subject and then the object.
3. In (A), the verb ""sodva"" (to taste) comes first, followed by the subject ""djan"" (John) and then the object ""le kukte"" (the cake).
4. In (B), the word order is incorrect, with the object ""kukte"" coming first, followed by the subject ""le djan"" (the John) and then the verb ""sodva"".
5. This is not a valid sentence structure in Lojban and therefore (B) is incorrect.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la loras. le murta go'i minde cu fuzme di'u
(B) le di'u cu go'i murta minde la fuzme loras.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down both sentences and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. (A) la loras. le murta go'i minde cu fuzme di'u (B) le di'u cu go'i murta minde la fuzme loras.
3. First, let's look at (A).
4. The sentence begins with ""la loras,"" which is a proper noun referring to a specific entity named Loras.
5. Next, we have ""le murta go'i minde,"" which is a description of an action involving a curtain (murta) and a command (minde).
6. The ""go'i"" here is a pro-bridi that refers back to the previous bridi, which in this case is the action of Loras.
7. The ""cu"" is a separator that helps to clarify the relationship between the sumti (arguments) and the selbri (predicate).
8. Finally, ""fuzme di'u"" indicates that Loras is responsible for the action described in the sentence.
9. Now, let's examine (B).
10. The sentence starts with ""le di'u,"" which is an incorrect usage of ""di'u"" as it should be used as a pro-sumti, not as a sumti with ""le.""
11. Next, we have ""cu go'i murta minde,"" which is an attempt to describe an action involving a curtain and a command, but the structure is incorrect.
12. The ""go'i"" should come after ""murta"" and before ""minde"" to properly refer back to the previous bridi.
13. Lastly, ""la fuzme loras"" is an incorrect combination of sumti and selbri, as ""fuzme"" should be used as a selbri, not as a sumti with ""la.""
14. In conclusion, (A) is a grammatically correct Lojban sentence, while (B) contains several errors in its structure and usage of sumti and selbri.
15. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) la loras. le murta go'i minde cu fuzme di'u.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje
(B) se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (B) because it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure.
2. In Lojban, the subject comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object.
3. In (B), ""se"" is the subject, ""cu"" is the verb, and ""be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku"" is the object.
4. This sentence structure is grammatically correct in Lojban.
5. On the other hand, (A) has an incorrect sentence structure.
6. ""ko'a"" is the subject, ""cu"" is the verb, and ""batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje"" is the object.

4. However, in (B), ""djan."" is the predicate and ""la cu flira se"" is the subject, which is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
5. Therefore, (B) is the incorrect answer.
6. Additionally, the use of ""la"" in (A) is more appropriate because it is used to refer to a specific individual, while ""cu"" is used to indicate the start of the predicate.
