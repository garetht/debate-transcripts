(B) le marce vi se munje

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) le marce vi se munje is the better answer.
3. (A) marce le vi munje se In this sentence, ""marce"" is the verb, meaning ""to move"" or ""to transport.""
4. However, the rest of the sentence is not structured correctly.
5. ""le vi munje se"" does not follow the proper Lojban grammar rules, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning.
6. The use of ""se"" at the end of the sentence is particularly problematic, as it should be used to change the order of the arguments in a verb, but it is not used correctly here.
7. (B) le marce vi se munje In this sentence, ""le marce"" refers to ""the vehicle,"" with ""marce"" being the noun form of the verb ""to move"" or ""to transport.""
8. ""vi"" is a location tag, indicating that the action is happening ""at this location.""
9. ""se munje"" means ""in the world"" or ""in the universe,"" with ""se"" changing the order of the arguments in the verb ""munje"" (to be a world).
10. So, the sentence can be translated as ""The vehicle is at this location in the world.""
11. As you can see, option (B) is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence, while option (A) is not.
12. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing (B) le marce vi se munje as the correct answer.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) cedra cu le jukpa fo'e is the better answer, we must first analyze the structure of both sentences.
2. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure is ""predicate + sumti"", where the predicate is a verb-like word that describes a relationship between the sumti, which are noun-like words that fill the roles in the relationship.
3. In option (A), ""cedra cu"" is the predicate, and ""le jukpa fo'e"" is the sumti.
4. The word ""cu"" is used to separate the predicate from the sumti, ensuring that the sentence is grammatically correct.
5. The word ""fo'e"" is a pronoun that can be used to refer to a previously mentioned object or concept.
6. In this case, it could be referring to a specific cooking method or ingredient.
7. So, the sentence can be translated as ""The era involves the cooking (method/ingredient).""
8. In option (B), ""le cedra cu"" is the sumti, and ""jukpa fo'e"" is the predicate.
9. However, this sentence structure is incorrect because ""le cedra"" should be followed by a predicate, not another sumti.

11. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) cedra cu le jukpa fo'e, as it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure and is grammatically correct.

3. (A) mi'o doi meris. ba jemna (B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris.
4. In both sentences, ""mi'o"" means ""we"" and ""doi"" is a vocative marker, which is used to address someone.
5. In this case, we are addressing someone named either ""meris"" or ""jemna.""
6. Now, let's look at the second part of each sentence.
7. In (A), ""ba jemna"" means ""will compete,"" with ""ba"" indicating a future tense and ""jemna"" meaning ""compete.""

8. In (B), ""jemna ba meris"" seems to suggest that ""jemna"" is the name being addressed, and ""ba meris"" would mean ""will Meris,"" which is not a complete thought or grammatically correct in Lojban.
9. So, based on the structure and grammar of Lojban, (A) ""mi'o doi meris. ba jemna"" is the better answer, as it translates to ""We, Meris, will compete.""
10. On the other hand, (B) ""mi'o doi jemna ba meris."" does not convey a complete thought and is not grammatically correct in Lojban.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la djan. cu se flira
(B) djan. la cu flira se

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying meaning accurately and unambiguously.
2. Let's analyze both options to see which one is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence.
3. Option (A) reads: ""la djan. cu se flira"" In this sentence, ""la djan."" refers to a specific person named John.
4. The word ""cu"" is a separator that helps to avoid ambiguity, and ""se flira"" is a verb phrase that means ""to be a face"" or ""to have a face.""
5. So, the sentence can be translated as ""John has a face"" or ""John is a face.""
6. This sentence follows the correct Lojban grammar rules and is a valid Lojban sentence.
7. Option (B) reads: ""djan. la cu flira se"" In this sentence, the word order is incorrect and does not follow the proper Lojban grammar rules.
8. The name ""djan."" should be preceded by ""la"" to indicate that it is a specific person.
9. Additionally, the ""cu"" and ""se"" are misplaced, causing confusion in the sentence structure.
10. This sentence is not a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence.
11. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) ""la djan. cu se flira"" as it follows the proper Lojban grammar rules and conveys a clear meaning.
12. Option (B) is incorrect due to its improper word order and sentence structure.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) so ca li le so'e cribe fatne
(B) li so ca cribe so'e le fatne

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the components of both options and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. (A) so ca li le so'e cribe fatne (B) li so ca cribe so'e le fatne First, let's look at option (A).
3. In this sentence, ""so"" is a digit that means ""5"", ""ca"" is a time tense that means ""now"", ""li"" is a number article, ""le"" is a definite article, ""so'e"" is a digit that means ""most"", ""cribe"" is a verb that means ""to be a bear"", and ""fatne"" is a verb that means ""to reverse"".
4. Now, let's analyze the structure of option (A).
5. The sentence can be translated as ""5 now the-number the most bears reverse"".
6. Although this may seem a bit strange, it is a grammatically valid Lojban sentence.
7. The structure follows the rules of Lojban grammar, with the appropriate use of articles, digits, and verbs.
8. Now, let's examine option (B).
9. In this sentence, ""li"" is a number article, ""so"" is a digit that means ""5"", ""ca"" is a time tense that means ""now"", ""cribe"" is a verb that means ""to be a bear"", ""so'e"" is a digit that means ""most"", and ""le"" is a definite article, and ""fatne"" is a verb that means ""to reverse"".
10. The structure of option (B) can be translated as ""the-number 5 now bears most the reverse"".
11. This sentence is not grammatically valid in Lojban because the definite article ""le"" is misplaced, and the sentence structure is not coherent.
12. Therefore, based on the analysis of both options, it is clear that option (A) is the correct answer, as it is a grammatically valid Lojban sentence.
13. Option (B) is incorrect due to its improper sentence structure and misplaced definite article.

2. (A) lo ve snada cu go'a (B) ve snada cu lo go'a In Lojban, ""lo"" is a determiner that means ""the thing(s) that really is(are)""; it is used to specify a particular object or objects.
3. ""ve snada"" means ""to succeed"" or ""to achieve"", and ""cu"" is a separator that is used to separate the subject from the predicate.
4. Finally, ""go'a"" is a pro-bridi that refers to the previous bridi (a bridi is a basic unit of meaning in Lojban, similar to a clause in English).
5. Now, let's analyze the structure of each sentence.
6. (A) lo ve snada cu go'a This sentence can be translated as ""The thing(s) that really is(are) succeeding is(are) the same as the previous bridi.""
7. However, this sentence is not grammatically correct because ""lo"" should be followed by a selbri (a predicate), not a sumti (an argument) like ""ve snada"".

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3. (A) ni'o le ro vibna ku lidne pensi ko'u This sentence translates to ""Section: the all female precedes thinking her.""
4. The structure of this sentence is confusing and does not convey a clear meaning.
5. The use of ""ni'o"" as a section separator is unnecessary, and the placement of ""lidne"" (precede) and ""pensi"" (think) is not in the correct order for a grammatical Lojban sentence.
6. (B) ro ni'o pensi lidne vibna le ko'u ku This sentence translates to ""All section-thinkers precede females in her group.""
7. In this sentence, the structure is more coherent and follows the proper Lojban grammar.
8. ""ro"" (all) is used to quantify the ""ni'o pensi"" (section-thinkers), and ""lidne"" (precede) is correctly placed before ""vibna"" (female) to indicate the intended action.
9. The use of ""le ko'u ku"" (in her group) further clarifies the context of the sentence.
10. As you can see, option (B) is a more grammatically correct and coherent sentence in Lojban.

(A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe
(B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante is the better answer, let's break down the components of both sentences and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""selbri"" (predicate) followed by ""sumti"" (arguments).
3. The selbri is the core of the sentence, describing the relationship between the sumti.
4. (A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe In this sentence, ""zu'i"" is a sumti, meaning ""the typical value"" or ""as expected.""
5. ""Le xance pante"" translates to ""the hand pants,"" which is an unusual combination of words.
6. ""Ku"" is an elidable terminator, used to mark the end of a construct.
7. Finally, ""plipe"" is a selbri, meaning ""to jump"" or ""to leap.""
8. The issue with this sentence is that the selbri ""plipe"" comes at the end, after the sumti and the terminator ""ku.""
9. This is not a valid Lojban sentence structure, as the selbri should come before the sumti.
10. (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante In this sentence, ""ku"" is again an elidable terminator, but its placement at the beginning of the sentence is more appropriate.
11. ""Zu'i"" is still a sumti, and ""xance plipe"" now functions as a selbri, meaning ""to jump with the hand.""
12. Finally, ""le pante"" translates to ""the pants.""
13. This sentence structure is more grammatically correct in Lojban, as the selbri ""xance plipe"" comes before the sumti ""le pante.""
14. The sentence can be interpreted as ""As expected, the hand jumps with the pants,"" which, while still unusual, is a valid Lojban sentence.
15. Therefore, (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante is the better answer, as it follows the correct Lojban sentence structure.

(B) kanla noras. jo'a jbama li'u la kerfa le lu

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) because it follows the proper Lojban grammar structure.
2. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is typically ""selbri"" followed by ""sumti"".
3. In (A), the ""selbri"" is ""kerfa le jbama"" (the hair of the bomb) and the ""sumti"" are ""lu jo'a la noras"" (the emotion of Noras) and ""kanla"" (the eye).
4. This structure is correct and follows the rules of Lojban grammar.
5. On the other hand, (B) is incorrect because it does not follow the proper Lojban grammar structure.
6. The ""selbri"" in (B) is ""jbama"" (the bomb) and the ""sumti"" are ""kanla"" (the eye) and ""la kerfa le lu"" (the hair of the wolf).
7. This structure is not correct and does not follow the rules of Lojban grammar.
8. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer and (B) is incorrect.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) goi li pa cu merli di'u
(B) di'u goi li pa cu merli

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) goi li pa cu merli di'u.
2. In Lojban, the word order is flexible, but there are certain rules that must be followed.
3. One of these rules is that the goi construction, which is used to specify a name or description, must come before the word it is modifying.
4. In this case, the goi construction is ""goi li pa"", which specifies the number one.
5. Therefore, it must come before the word it is modifying, which is ""merli di'u"", meaning ""counts this"".
6. If we were to switch the word order and say ""di'u goi li pa cu merli"", we would be violating this rule and creating an ungrammatical sentence.
7. So, the correct answer is (A) goi li pa cu merli di'u.
8. It's important to pay attention to the order of words in Lojban, as it can greatly affect the meaning of a sentence.
9. In this case, switching the order of the words would not only be ungrammatical, but it would also change the meaning of the sentence.
10. So, always be careful when constructing sentences in Lojban!

(A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le
(B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the two options and analyze their grammatical structures.
2. (A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le (B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka First, let's look at option (A).
3. In this sentence, ""panje"" is the verb, meaning ""to spread"" or ""to extend.""
4. ""Pu"" is a tense marker indicating past time, and ""xanka"" is the object being spread, which can be translated as ""nervousness"" or ""anxiety.""
5. The particle ""cu"" separates the verb from the following predicate, ""surla,"" which means ""to relax.""
6. Finally, ""loi le"" is a quantifier that can be translated as ""some of the.""
7. Now, let's analyze option (B).
8. In this sentence, ""le surla"" is a noun phrase meaning ""the relaxation.""
9. The particle ""cu"" separates the noun phrase from the verb ""panje,"" which, as mentioned earlier, means ""to spread"" or ""to extend.""
10. ""Pu"" is again a tense marker indicating past time, and ""loi xanka"" is a quantifier meaning ""some of the nervousness"" or ""some of the anxiety.""
11. Comparing the two options, it is clear that option (A) has a more logical and coherent structure.
12. In option (A), the sentence can be translated as ""The spreading of nervousness in the past relaxed some of the (people).""
13. This sentence makes sense and conveys a clear meaning.
14. On the other hand, option (B) can be translated as ""The relaxation spread some of the nervousness in the past.""
15. This sentence is not only awkward but also seems to convey a contradictory meaning, as relaxation and nervousness are generally considered opposites.
16. Therefore, based on the grammatical structure and the logical coherence of the sentences, I would argue that (A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le is the better answer, and (B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka is incorrect.

(B) le zifre krixa be le gusta zabna cfika cakla ku be'o tabra cu pluka nu prosa la djim.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the better answer, let's break down both options and analyze their grammatical structures.
2. (A) gusta djim. krixa zifre zabna pluka be prosa cfika cu nu le ku cakla la tabra le be'o (B) le zifre krixa be le gusta zabna cfika cakla ku be'o tabra cu pluka nu prosa la djim.
3. First, let's look at option (A).
4. The sentence begins with ""gusta djim,"" which is a simple and clear statement that translates to ""Jim's restaurant.""
5. The rest of the sentence, ""krixa zifre zabna pluka be prosa cfika cu nu le ku cakla la tabra le be'o,"" describes the restaurant in a more complex manner, but it is still grammatically correct.
6. It essentially says that the restaurant is a place where one can enjoy freedom, pleasantness, and the beauty of prose and chocolate while listening to the trumpet.
7. Now, let's examine option (B).
8. The sentence starts with ""le zifre krixa be le gusta zabna cfika cakla ku be'o tabra cu pluka nu prosa la djim.""
9. While this sentence may seem similar to option (A), there are some subtle differences that make it less grammatically correct.
10. For example, the use of ""be"" and ""be'o"" in this sentence is not as clear as in option (A), and the overall structure is less coherent.
11. In conclusion, while both options may appear to be valid Lojban sentences at first glance, option (A) is the better answer due to its clearer grammatical structure and more coherent meaning.
12. Option (B) may seem similar, but it contains subtle errors that make it less correct.
13. Therefore, I would recommend choosing option (A) as the correct answer.

4. The sentence begins with ""gusta djim,"" which is a simple and clear statement that translates to ""Jim's restaurant.""
5. The rest of the sentence, ""krixa zifre zabna pluka be prosa cfika cu nu le ku cakla la tabra le be'o,"" describes the restaurant in a more complex manner, but it is still grammatically correct.
6. It essentially says that the restaurant is a place where one can enjoy freedom, pleasantness, and the beauty of prose and chocolate while listening to the trumpet.
7. Now, let's examine option (B).
8. The sentence starts with ""le zifre krixa be le gusta zabna cfika cakla ku be'o tabra cu pluka nu prosa la djim.""
9. While this sentence may seem similar to option (A), there are some subtle differences that make it less grammatically correct.
10. For example, the use of ""be"" and ""be'o"" in this sentence is not as clear as in option (A), and the overall structure is less coherent.
11. In conclusion, while both options may appear to be valid Lojban sentences at first glance, option (A) is the better answer due to its clearer grammatical structure and more coherent meaning.
12. Option (B) may seem similar, but it contains subtle errors that make it less correct.
13. Therefore, I would recommend choosing option (A) as the correct answer.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la djim. pu xance la dikca loras.
(B) pu la loras. xance dikca la djim.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the correct word order is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3. (A) la djim. pu xance la dikca loras.
4. This sentence can be broken down as follows: - la djim: refers to a person or thing named ""Jim"" - pu: a tense marker indicating past time - xance: the Lojban word for ""hand"" - la dikca: refers to a person or thing named ""Dikca"" - loras: this word is not a valid Lojban word and creates confusion in the sentence.
5. Now let's look at option (B).
6. (B) pu la loras. xance dikca la djim.
7. This sentence can be broken down as follows: - pu: a tense marker indicating past time - la loras: refers to a person or thing named ""Loras"" - xance: the Lojban word for ""hand"" - dikca: the Lojban word for ""electric"" or ""electrical"" - la djim: refers to a person or thing named ""Jim"" In option (B), the sentence structure is more coherent and follows the correct Lojban word order.
8. It can be translated as ""In the past, Loras' hand was electric to Jim.""
9. Although the meaning might still be a bit unclear, it is a grammatically valid Lojban sentence.
10. On the other hand, option (A) contains an invalid Lojban word (loras) and has a confusing word order.
11. Therefore, I would recommend choosing option (B) as the better answer.

1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the correct meaning.
2. Let's break down both options and see why (B) is the better choice.
3. (A) le ku srana cu lo cerda drani This sentence can be translated as ""The thing related to the correct inheritor.""
4. However, the use of ""ku"" here is unnecessary and disrupts the grammatical structure of the sentence.
5. In Lojban, ""ku"" is used to close a prepositional phrase, but there is no need for it in this sentence.
6. (B) lo srana ku le drani cu cerda This sentence can be translated as ""The related thing is the correct inheritor.""
7. In this case, the structure is more coherent, and the meaning is clear.
8. The use of ""ku"" is still not necessary, but it does not disrupt the sentence's grammatical structure as it does in option (A).
9. Therefore, I would recommend choosing option (B) as the better answer.
10. While neither option is perfect, (B) is more grammatically sound and conveys a clear meaning.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) lei na ca lanka cu mansa
(B) mansa ca na cu lei lanka

Proposed solution:
1. Ah, I see you're considering option (A) as the correct answer.
2. However, let me explain why (B) is actually the better choice.
3. In Lojban, the typical sentence structure follows the pattern of ""sumti selbri sumti,"" where sumti are the arguments and selbri is the relation between them.
4. In option (A), ""lei na ca lanka cu mansa,"" the structure seems to be a bit off.
5. It appears to be saying ""The not-now baskets are satisfied,"" which doesn't make much sense.
6. On the other hand, option (B), ""mansa ca na cu lei lanka,"" follows the correct sentence structure.
7. Here, ""mansa"" is the selbri, meaning ""satisfy,"" and ""ca na"" and ""cu lei lanka"" are the sumti, meaning ""not now"" and ""the baskets,"" respectively.
8. So, this sentence translates to ""The baskets are not satisfied now,"" which is a more coherent statement.
9. Furthermore, the use of ""cu"" in option (B) is more appropriate, as it separates the selbri from the sumti, ensuring that the sentence is grammatically correct.
10. In option (A), the placement of ""cu"" is incorrect, as it should be placed between the selbri and the sumti.
11. So, based on the proper sentence structure and the correct use of ""cu,"" I would argue that option (B) is the better answer.
12. While it may seem counterintuitive, Lojban is a unique language with its own set of rules, and understanding these rules is crucial for determining the correct answer in this case.

A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ko cu gutra fa ko'u
(B) ko'u cu ko gutra fa

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (B) ko'u cu ko gutra fa.
2. This is because in Lojban, the subject comes before the predicate.
3. In option (A), the subject ""ko"" comes after the predicate ""gutra fa ko'u"", which is grammatically incorrect.
4. Option (B) correctly places the subject ""ko'u"" before the predicate ""ko gutra fa"".
5. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer.
6. Additionally, the use of ""cu"" in option (A) is unnecessary and redundant.
7. In Lojban, ""cu"" is only used to mark the beginning of a predicate, and since ""gutra fa ko'u"" is already a predicate, the ""cu"" is not needed.
8. Option (B) correctly omits the unnecessary ""cu"".
9. In conclusion, (B) ko'u cu ko gutra fa is the correct and grammatically valid answer in Lojban.
