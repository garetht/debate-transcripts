Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) le loldi cu nicte jdika
(B) nicte loldi cu le jdika

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (B) nicte loldi cu le jdika.
2. This is because in Lojban, the predicate comes before the sumti (noun or pronoun) that it applies to.
3. In option (A), ""nicte jdika"" is the predicate, but it comes after ""le loldi"", which is a sumti.
4. This violates the grammar rules of Lojban.
5. On the other hand, option (B) follows the correct order of predicate before sumti.
6. ""nicte loldi"" is the predicate, and ""le jdika"" is the sumti that it applies to.
7. Therefore, (B) is the correct and grammatical answer.
8. It's important to pay attention to the order of words in Lojban, as it can greatly affect the meaning of the sentence.
9. In this case, the order of words determines whether the sentence is grammatically correct or not.
10. So, always remember to put the predicate before the sumti in Lojban!

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) marce le vi munje se
(B) le marce vi se munje

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) le marce vi se munje is the better answer.
3. (A) marce le vi munje se In this sentence, ""marce"" is the verb, meaning ""to move"" or ""to transport.""
4. However, the rest of the sentence is not structured correctly.
5. ""le vi munje se"" does not follow the proper Lojban grammar rules, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning.
6. The use of ""se"" at the end of the sentence is particularly problematic, as it should be used to change the order of the arguments in a verb, but it is not used correctly here.
7. (B) le marce vi se munje In this sentence, ""le marce"" refers to ""the vehicle,"" with ""marce"" being the noun form of the verb ""to move"" or ""to transport.""
8. ""vi"" is a location tag, indicating that the action is happening ""at this location.""
9. ""se munje"" means ""in the world"" or ""in the universe,"" with ""se"" changing the order of the arguments in the verb ""munje"" (to be a world).
10. So, the sentence can be translated as ""The vehicle is at this location in the world.""
11. As you can see, option (B) is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence, while option (A) is not.
12. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing (B) le marce vi se munje as the correct answer.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu
(B) mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) is the correct answer, let's break down both sentences and analyze their structures.
2. (A) terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu (B) mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa First, let's look at the structure of (A).
3. The sentence starts with ""terpa,"" which means ""to fear.""
4. However, the rest of the sentence is quite jumbled and doesn't follow proper Lojban grammar.
5. The phrase ""le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu"" is not a well-formed sumti, which is required to follow ""terpa.""
6. The use of ""vau"" and ""kei"" in this sentence is also incorrect, as they are not used in the proper context.
7. Now, let's examine (B).
8. The sentence starts with ""mi,"" which means ""I"" or ""me.""
9. This is followed by ""zu'i,"" which is a sumti that refers to the typical or expected value.
10. The next part of the sentence, ""cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei,"" is a well-formed sumti that describes an event of lying down with a stick.
11. Finally, the sentence ends with ""terpa,"" which means ""to fear.""
12. So, the sentence (B) can be translated as ""I, as expected, fear the event of lying down with a stick.""
13. This sentence is grammatically correct and makes logical sense in Lojban.
14. In conclusion, (B) ""mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa"" is the correct answer because it follows proper Lojban grammar and structure, while (A) ""terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu"" is incorrect due to its jumbled structure and improper use of certain Lojban words.
15. I hope this explanation helps you understand why (B) is the better answer.

1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the two options and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. Option (A) reads: ""se .i cu dapma racli le"" Option (B) reads: "".i le se dapma cu racli"" First, let's look at option (B).
3. The sentence starts with "".i"", which is a simple sentence separator in Lojban.
4. It is typically used to separate two sentences, but in this case, there is no preceding sentence, which makes the use of "".i"" at the beginning of the sentence unusual and potentially incorrect.
5. Now, let's examine option (A).
6. The sentence starts with ""se"", which is a conversion operator in Lojban.
7. It is used to change the order of the arguments in a predicate.
8. In this case, it is followed by "".i"", which, as mentioned earlier, is a sentence separator.
9. However, in this context, it is used correctly, as it separates the conversion operator ""se"" from the rest of the sentence.
10. Next, we have ""cu"", which is a separator used to prevent ambiguity in Lojban sentences.
11. It is followed by ""dapma"", which is a verb meaning ""to curse"" or ""to damn"".
12. Then, we have ""racli"", which means ""rational"" or ""reasonable"", and finally, ""le"", which is a definite article meaning ""the"".

8. Finally, we have ""coi,"" which is a greeting, and ""se ba,"" which is a valid Lojban grammatical construct.
9. Now, let's examine option (B).
10. The sentence begins with ""ba,"" which is a future tense marker, followed by ""mi,"" which means ""I"" or ""me.""
11. Then, we have ""le vlipa cu pinca,"" which translates to ""the powerful pinch.""
12. However, the use of ""cu"" here is incorrect, as it should be placed before ""pinca"" to avoid ambiguity.
13. Next, we have ""se panra lo mensi,"" which means ""compared to a sister,"" but the use of ""se"" here is incorrect, as it should be placed before ""panra.""
14. Finally, we have ""coi"" and ""loras,"" which are a greeting and a name, respectively.
15. Based on this analysis, it is clear that option (A) is a better answer than option (B), as it has a more valid and grammatical structure in Lojban.
16. While option (B) may appear to be correct at first glance, the incorrect placement of ""cu"" and ""se"" makes it an invalid choice.
17. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing option (A) as the correct answer.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) loras. panra lo mensi cu le mi vlipa pinca coi. se ba
(B) ba mi le vlipa cu pinca se panra lo mensi coi. loras.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down both options and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. (A) loras. panra lo mensi cu le mi vlipa pinca coi. se ba (B) ba mi le vlipa cu pinca se panra lo mensi coi. loras.
3. First, let's look at option (A).
4. The sentence begins with ""loras,"" which is a valid Lojban name.
5. Then, we have ""panra lo mensi,"" which means ""comparing to a sister.""
6. Next, we have ""cu,"" which is a separator used to avoid ambiguity.

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) ko cu gutra fa ko'u.
2. This is because in Lojban, the verb comes before the subject.
3. Therefore, ""gutra"" (which means ""to enclose"") must come before ""ko'u"" (which means ""me"").
4. In option (B), ""ko'u"" comes before ""gutra"", which is grammatically incorrect in Lojban.

3. The sentence begins with ""loras,"" which is a valid Lojban word.
4. Next, we have ""lu,"" which is a quotation marker, followed by ""ni'o,"" which is a paragraph separator.
5. Then, we have ""fo'a,"" which is a pronoun referring to a previously mentioned object, followed by ""se lanme,"" which means ""is a sheep"" in Lojban.

8. Now, let's examine option (B).

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la dembi noras. se cu fo'o
(B) fo'o cu se dembi la noras.

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) ""la dembi noras. se cu fo'o"".
2. This is because in Lojban, the subject comes before the predicate, and the verb ""se"" indicates that the subject is the receiver of the action.
3. Therefore, ""la dembi"" is the subject and ""noras"" is the predicate.
4. Additionally, ""cu"" is used to separate the subject and predicate in Lojban sentences.
5. On the other hand, (B) ""fo'o cu se dembi la noras"" is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
6. The word ""fo'o"" is not a valid Lojban word, and the word order is incorrect.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la dembi noras. se cu fo'o
(B) fo'o cu se dembi la noras.

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) ""la dembi noras. se cu fo'o"".
2. This is because in Lojban, the subject comes before the predicate, and the verb ""se"" indicates that the subject is the receiver of the action.
3. Therefore, ""la dembi"" is the subject and ""noras"" is the predicate.
4. Additionally, ""cu"" is used to separate the subject and predicate in Lojban sentences.
5. On the other hand, (B) ""fo'o cu se dembi la noras"" is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
6. The word ""fo'o"" is not a valid Lojban word, and the word order is incorrect.
7. The subject should come before the predicate, so ""la noras"" should come before ""se dembi"".

(A) ko'o fi le canre cu zabna
(B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying meaning accurately and unambiguously.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (A) is the better answer.
3. (A) ko'o fi le canre cu zabna (B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu First, let's break down the components of each sentence: - ko'o: a pro-sumti, which is a pronoun-like word that stands for a previously mentioned sumti (noun-like word).
4. - fi: a preposition-like word that marks the place structure of a selbri (verb-like word).
5. #NAME?
6. - canre: a gismu (root word) that means ""sand.""
7. #NAME?
8. - zabna: a gismu that means ""good"" or ""favorable.""
9. Now, let's examine the structure of each sentence: (A) ko'o fi le canre cu zabna This sentence can be translated as ""For ko'o, the sand is good.""
10. The structure is as follows: - ko'o: the pro-sumti referring to a previously mentioned noun-like word.
11. #NAME?
12. - le canre: the sumti, meaning ""the sand.""
13. #NAME?
14. - zabna: the selbri, meaning ""good"" or ""favorable.""
15. (B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu This sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban, as the structure is jumbled and unclear.
16. The intended meaning is difficult to discern, and the placement of ""fi"" and ""cu"" creates confusion.
17. In conclusion, option (A) is the better answer because it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure, ensuring that the meaning is clear and unambiguous.
18. Option (B) is incorrect due to its jumbled structure and unclear meaning.

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) goi li pa cu merli di'u.
2. In Lojban, the word order is flexible, but there are certain rules that must be followed.
3. One of these rules is that the goi construction, which is used to specify a name or description, must come before the word it is modifying.
4. In this case, the goi construction is ""goi li pa"", which specifies the number one.
5. Therefore, it must come before the word it is modifying, which is ""merli di'u"", meaning ""counts this"".
6. If we were to switch the word order and say ""di'u goi li pa cu merli"", we would be violating this rule and creating an ungrammatical sentence.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ku se ka vau kei stela le tunba steba
(B) le ka stela vau kei se steba ku tunba

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) is the correct answer, let's first analyze both options and see how they differ in terms of grammar and meaning.
2. Option (A) reads: ""ku se ka vau kei stela le tunba steba"" This sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
3. The structure is confusing and does not follow the proper rules for constructing a valid Lojban sentence.
4. Specifically, ""ku"" and ""vau"" are misplaced, and the sentence lacks a clear relationship between the words.
5. Option (B) reads: ""le ka stela vau kei se steba ku tunba"" This sentence is grammatically correct in Lojban.
6. It follows the proper structure and rules for constructing a valid Lojban sentence.
7. The sentence can be translated as ""The event of being a sibling involves strong emotions.""
8. Here, ""le ka stela"" refers to the event of being a sibling, ""vau kei"" indicates the involvement or relationship, ""se steba"" refers to strong emotions, and ""ku tunba"" specifies the sibling relationship.
9. Based on this analysis, it is clear that option (B) is the better answer, as it is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence, while option (A) is not.

(B) fo'o cu se dembi la noras.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down both options and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. Option (A) reads: ""la dembi noras. se cu fo'o"" In this sentence, ""la dembi noras"" refers to a specific entity named ""dembis noras"".
3. The period indicates the end of the first part of the sentence.
4. The second part, ""se cu fo'o"", is a grammatical construction that indicates a certain relationship or action involving the previously mentioned entity.
5. In this case, it suggests that ""dembis noras"" is involved in a particular action or state.
6. Option (B) reads: ""fo'o cu se dembi la noras.""
7. In this sentence, ""fo'o"" is a placeholder for a missing or unspecified entity.
8. The ""cu"" is a separator that is used to avoid ambiguity, but in this case, it is misplaced and creates confusion.
9. The ""se dembi la noras"" part is an attempt to describe a relationship or action involving ""noras"", but the structure is incorrect and does not convey a clear meaning.
10. Now, let's compare the two options.

2. Option (A) reads: ""ki'o spoja cu mucti la'e la djan.""
3.

4. Putting it all together, option (A) can be translated as ""1000 explosions are silently happening to John.""
5. Now let's look at option (B): ""mucti cu spoja djan. la ki'o la'e"" In this sentence, ""mucti"" and ""spoja"" are the same as in option (A), but the order is different.
6. ""djan"" is the name John without the ""la"" particle, which is incorrect in Lojban.
7. The rest of the sentence, ""la ki'o la'e,"" is not grammatically connected to the first part and does not make sense in this context.
8. Therefore, option (A) is the better answer because it is a grammatically correct and coherent sentence in Lojban, while option (B) contains errors and does not form a complete thought.
9. Even if you might think that option (B) could be correct, the structure and coherence of option (A) make it a more valid choice.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) jmifa clupa ca le tu
(B) le jmifa ca clupa tu

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) le jmifa ca clupa tu is the better answer.
3. (A) jmifa clupa ca le tu In this sentence, the word order is incorrect.
4. In Lojban, the typical sentence structure follows the pattern: ""sumti selbri sumti"", where ""sumti"" are the arguments and ""selbri"" is the relation between them.
5. In this case, ""jmifa"" and ""clupa"" are both selbri, and ""ca"" and ""le tu"" are sumti.
6. The correct structure should have a selbri between two sumti, but this sentence has two selbri next to each other, which is not grammatical in Lojban.
7. (B) le jmifa ca clupa tu This sentence follows the correct Lojban structure: ""sumti selbri sumti"".
8. ""Le jmifa"" is the first sumti, ""ca clupa"" is the selbri, and ""tu"" is the second sumti.
9. This sentence translates to ""The small one is near you"", which is a valid and grammatical Lojban sentence.
10. Therefore, the better answer is (B) le jmifa ca clupa tu, as it follows the correct sentence structure and conveys a clear meaning.
11. While (A) jmifa clupa ca le tu may seem similar, its incorrect word order makes it an invalid Lojban sentence.

(A) ku ragve le sumji vlipa loras. la da'a prina mensi fenra
(B) la loras. da'a ragve prina mensi ku fenra sumji le vlipa

Proposed solution:
1. First, let's analyze both options to understand their structure and meaning.
2. Option (A) can be broken down as follows: - ku: a marker used to close a previous construct - ragve: across, on the other side of - le sumji: the sum, the result - vlipa: powerful, strong - loras: a name, Loras - la da'a: another name, Da'a - prina: to print, to make an impression - mensi: sister - fenra: to be angry, to be furious Now, let's analyze option (B): - la loras: a name, Loras - da'a: a quantifier meaning ""all but one"" - ragve: across, on the other side of - prina: to print, to make an impression - mensi: sister - ku: a marker used to close a previous construct - fenra: to be angry, to be furious - sumji: to sum, to add up - le vlipa: the powerful, the strong As a Lojban expert, I can tell you that option (A) is the better answer because it follows the correct grammatical structure of the language.
3. In Lojban, the order of words is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
4. Option (A) has a more logical flow of words, starting with the marker ""ku"" to close a previous construct, followed by the description of the location ""ragve le sumji"", then the adjective ""vlipa"" to describe Loras, and finally the action ""prina mensi fenra"" involving Da'a.
5. On the other hand, option (B) has a less coherent structure.
6. It starts with the name ""la loras"" but then introduces the quantifier ""da'a"" without a clear reference.
7. The marker ""ku"" is also misplaced, as it should be used to close a previous construct, not to separate the action ""prina mensi"" from the adjective ""fenra"".
8. This makes the sentence harder to understand and less grammatically correct.
9. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing option (A) as the better answer.
10. It follows the proper Lojban grammar rules and conveys a clearer meaning.
11. While option (B) may seem similar, its structure is less coherent and more difficult to understand, making it the wrong choice.

3. In (B), ""le ka stela"" is the subject, ""vau kei se steba"" is the predicate, and ""ku tunba"" is the object.
4. This sentence structure is correct and follows the rules of Lojban grammar.
5. On the other hand, (A) is incorrect because it does not follow the proper sentence structure.
6. ""ku se ka vau kei stela"" is not a valid subject, predicate, or object in Lojban.
7. It is a jumbled phrase that does not make sense in the language.
8. Therefore, (A) cannot be the correct answer.
9. In conclusion, (B) is the correct answer because it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure, while (A) does not.

1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's break down both options and see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3. (A) ki'o spoja cu mucti la'e la djan. This sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
4. The word ""ki'o"" is a number, and it doesn't make sense to start a sentence with a number in this context.
5. Additionally, the structure of the sentence is confusing, as it seems to be trying to say something about ""spoja"" and ""mucti,"" but the placement of ""la'e"" and ""la djan"" is unclear.
6. (B) mucti cu spoja djan. la ki'o la'e This sentence is grammatically correct in Lojban.
7. It can be translated as ""The emptiness causes John to explode.
8. The thing referred to by the number ki'o.""
9. The structure of the sentence is clear, with ""mucti"" (emptiness) being the subject, ""cu"" marking the end of the subject, ""spoja"" (explode) being the verb, and ""djan"" (John) being the object.
10. The second part of the sentence, ""la ki'o la'e,"" is a separate statement referring to the thing represented by the number ""ki'o.""
11. As you can see, option (B) is a better answer because it is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning, while option (A) is not grammatically correct and has a confusing structure.

(A) pe'u. djan. do'u te sodva le kukte
(B) kukte pe'u. le djan. sodva do'u te

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down both options and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. (A) pe'u. djan. do'u te sodva le kukte (B) kukte pe'u. le djan. sodva do'u te First, let's look at option (A).
3. The sentence structure is as follows: 1. pe'u - a polite request marker 2. djan - a name, in this case, ""John"" 3. do'u - an end marker for the request 4. te sodva - a verb phrase meaning ""to serve a drink"" 5. le kukte - a noun phrase meaning ""the tasty one"" Putting it all together, option (A) translates to ""Please, John, serve the tasty drink.""
4. Now, let's analyze option (B): 1. kukte - an adjective meaning ""tasty"" 2. pe'u - a polite request marker 3. le djan - a noun phrase meaning ""the John"" 4. sodva - a noun meaning ""drink"" 5. do'u - an end marker for the request 6. te - a particle that should introduce a verb phrase, but there is no verb phrase following it As you can see, option (B) has a misplaced ""te"" particle and an incorrect noun phrase ""le djan"" instead of just ""djan.""
5. The sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban, and it doesn't convey a clear meaning.
6. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) pe'u. djan. do'u te sodva le kukte, as it is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence that translates to ""Please, John, serve the tasty drink.""
7. Option (B) is incorrect due to its grammatical errors and unclear meaning.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la djan. cu se flira
(B) djan. la cu flira se

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying meaning accurately and unambiguously.
2. Let's analyze both options to see which one is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence.
3. Option (A) reads: ""la djan. cu se flira"" In this sentence, ""la djan."" refers to a specific person named John.
4. The word ""cu"" is a separator that helps to avoid ambiguity, and ""se flira"" is a verb phrase that means ""to be a face"" or ""to have a face.""
5. So, the sentence can be translated as ""John has a face"" or ""John is a face.""
6. This sentence follows the correct Lojban grammar rules and is a valid Lojban sentence.
7. Option (B) reads: ""djan. la cu flira se"" In this sentence, the word order is incorrect and does not follow the proper Lojban grammar rules.
8. The name ""djan."" should be preceded by ""la"" to indicate that it is a specific person.
9. Additionally, the ""cu"" and ""se"" are misplaced, causing confusion in the sentence structure.
10. This sentence is not a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence.
11. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) ""la djan. cu se flira"" as it follows the proper Lojban grammar rules and conveys a clear meaning.
12. Option (B) is incorrect due to its improper word order and sentence structure.

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) ""le jukpa cu broda fi ko"".
2. This is because in Lojban, the predicate (the verb or adjective) always comes first in the sentence, followed by the arguments.
3. In (A), ""broda"" is the predicate and ""le jukpa"" is the argument, so it is grammatically correct.
4. In (B), ""fi"" is the argument and ""le jukpa broda"" is the predicate, which is not correct according to Lojban grammar rules.
5. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer.
6. Additionally, ""fi"" is a tricky word in Lojban because it can mean different things depending on the context.
7. It can mean ""I"", ""you"", ""he/she/it"", or ""they"".

2. Let's analyze both options to see which one is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence.
3. Option (A) - ""lei na ca lanka cu mansa"" In this sentence, we have the following components: - ""lei"" is a determiner that refers to a specific group of things.
4. - ""na"" is a negation particle, which negates the following word or phrase.
5. - ""ca"" is a tense particle, indicating that the action is happening in the present.
6. - ""lanka"" is a noun, which could represent a type of object or concept.
7. - ""cu"" is a separator, used to separate the subject from the predicate.

16. - ""lanka"" is a noun.
17. The structure of this sentence is as follows: [verb] [tense] [negation] [separator] [determiner] [noun].
18. This structure is not consistent with the rules of Lojban grammar, as it does not clearly separate the subject from the predicate.

A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ku ragve le sumji vlipa loras. la da'a prina mensi fenra
(B) la loras. da'a ragve prina mensi ku fenra sumji le vlipa

Proposed solution:
1. First, let's analyze both sentences to understand their structure and meaning.
2. (A) ku ragve le sumji vlipa loras. la da'a prina mensi fenra This sentence seems to be a mix of Lojban words and phrases, but it doesn't follow the proper grammatical structure.
3. The word ""ku"" is used incorrectly, and the sentence lacks the necessary structure to convey a clear meaning.
4. (B) la loras. da'a ragve prina mensi ku fenra sumji le vlipa This sentence, on the other hand, follows the correct Lojban grammar and structure.
5. It can be translated as ""Loras is beyond the powerful sum, and the remaining printed sisters are angry.""
6. While the meaning might seem a bit unusual, it is a valid and grammatical Lojban sentence.
7. Now, let's break down the sentence (B) to understand why it is the correct answer: - ""la loras."" is a proper Lojban name, meaning ""Loras.""
8. - ""da'a"" is a quantifier meaning ""the rest"" or ""the remaining.""
9. - ""ragve"" means ""beyond"" or ""on the other side of.""
10. - ""prina"" means ""printed"" or ""to print.""
11. - ""mensi"" means ""sister.""
12. - ""ku"" is used correctly here as a clause terminator.
13. - ""fenra"" means ""angry"" or ""to be angry.""
14. - ""sumji"" means ""sum"" or ""to add.""
15. - ""le vlipa"" is a valid Lojban phrase meaning ""the powerful.""
16. As you can see, sentence (B) follows the correct Lojban grammar and structure, making it the better answer.

Is Sentence 5 of the proposed solution correct or flawed?","The topic at issue is whether Sentence 5 of a proposed solution to a problem is correct or flawed. A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ku ragve le sumji vlipa loras. la da'a prina mensi fenra
(B) la loras. da'a ragve prina mensi ku fenra sumji le vlipa

Proposed solution:
1. First, let's analyze both sentences to understand their structure and meaning.
2. (A) ku ragve le sumji vlipa loras. la da'a prina mensi fenra This sentence seems to be a mix of Lojban words and phrases, but it doesn't follow the proper grammatical structure.
3. The word ""ku"" is used incorrectly, and the sentence lacks the necessary structure to convey a clear meaning.
4. (B) la loras. da'a ragve prina mensi ku fenra sumji le vlipa This sentence, on the other hand, follows the correct Lojban grammar and structure.
5. It can be translated as ""Loras is beyond the powerful sum, and the remaining printed sisters are angry.""
6. While the meaning might seem a bit unusual, it is a valid and grammatical Lojban sentence.
7. Now, let's break down the sentence (B) to understand why it is the correct answer: - ""la loras."" is a proper Lojban name, meaning ""Loras.""
8. - ""da'a"" is a quantifier meaning ""the rest"" or ""the remaining.""
9. - ""ragve"" means ""beyond"" or ""on the other side of.""
10. - ""prina"" means ""printed"" or ""to print.""
11. - ""mensi"" means ""sister.""
12. - ""ku"" is used correctly here as a clause terminator.
13. - ""fenra"" means ""angry"" or ""to be angry.""
14. - ""sumji"" means ""sum"" or ""to add.""
15. - ""le vlipa"" is a valid Lojban phrase meaning ""the powerful.""
16. As you can see, sentence (B) follows the correct Lojban grammar and structure, making it the better answer.
17. Sentence (A) is a mix of Lojban words and phrases but lacks the proper structure to convey a clear meaning.
18. Therefore, I would recommend choosing (B) la loras. da'a ragve prina mensi ku fenra sumji le vlipa as the correct answer.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer and (B) is incorrect, let's first break down the structure of each sentence.
2. (A) le go'i sepli drani cu pinca le milxe This sentence can be translated as ""The thing which is separated correctly is mildly spicy.""
3. Here, ""le go'i"" refers to the thing being discussed, ""sepli"" means separated, ""drani"" means correctly, ""cu"" is a separator between the subject and the predicate, ""pinca"" means spicy, and ""le milxe"" means mildly.
4. (B) milxe go'i le drani le cu sepli pinca This sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban.

7. Now, let's analyze the grammar and structure of both sentences.
8. In sentence (A), the structure is clear and follows the standard Lojban grammar rules.
9. The subject is ""le go'i sepli drani,"" which is a noun phrase that describes the thing being discussed.
10. The predicate is ""pinca le milxe,"" which is an adjective phrase that describes the property of being mildly spicy.
11. The separator ""cu"" is placed correctly between the subject and the predicate, ensuring that the sentence is grammatically correct.
12. In sentence (B), the structure is not clear, and the grammar rules are not followed.
13. The placement of ""cu"" is incorrect, causing confusion in the sentence structure.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3. (A) loras. lu ni'o fo'a se lanme mi'a li'u cradi This sentence can be broken down as follows: - loras: a name or a non-Lojban word - lu: start of a quotation - ni'o: paragraph separator - fo'a: pronoun referring to a previously mentioned sumti (noun-like element) - se: changes the order of sumti in a bridi (predicate-like element) - lanme: sheep - mi'a: first person plural pronoun, ""we"" or ""us"" - li'u: end of a quotation - cradi: radio The sentence seems to be a mix of unrelated words and lacks a clear structure.
4. It's difficult to extract a coherent meaning from it.
5. (B) mi'a cradi loras. lanme li'u ni'o se lu fo'a This sentence can be broken down as follows: - mi'a: first person plural pronoun, ""we"" or ""us"" - cradi: radio - loras: a name or a non-Lojban word - lanme: sheep - li'u: end of a quotation - ni'o: paragraph separator - se: changes the order of sumti in a bridi (predicate-like element) - lu: start of a quotation - fo'a: pronoun referring to a previously mentioned sumti (noun-like element) In this sentence, we can see a more coherent structure.
6. It can be interpreted as ""We radio Loras. Sheep (quotation) (paragraph separator) (change order) (start of quotation) (pronoun).""
7. Although it's not a perfect Lojban sentence, it has a more logical structure than (A) and can be understood as an attempt to communicate something related to radio communication with Loras and sheep.
8. Therefore, I would argue that (B) is a better answer than (A) because it has a more coherent structure and conveys a more understandable meaning.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) lei ba stidi cu ckape pinca ko'a
(B) stidi cu ko'a lei ckape ba pinca

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (A) is the better answer.
3. (A) lei ba stidi cu ckape pinca ko'a In this sentence, we have the following components: - ""lei ba stidi"" refers to a group of things that will study in the future.
4. - ""cu"" is a separator that helps to clarify the structure of the sentence.
5. - ""ckape pinca"" is a compound term that refers to a dangerous fish.
6. - ""ko'a"" is a pronoun that refers to a previously mentioned entity.
7. Putting it all together, this sentence can be translated as ""The group of future students is a dangerous fish to him/her/it.""
8. (B) stidi cu ko'a lei ckape ba pinca In this sentence, we have the following components: - ""stidi"" refers to the act of studying.
9. - ""cu"" is a separator, as mentioned before.
10. - ""ko'a"" is the pronoun, referring to a previously mentioned entity.
11. - ""lei ckape ba pinca"" is a group of dangerous fish that will exist in the future.
12. However, the structure of this sentence is problematic.
13. The intended meaning is unclear, as it could be interpreted as ""Studying is him/her/it to the group of future dangerous fish"" or ""Studying is the group of future dangerous fish to him/her/it.""
14. The sentence is ambiguous and does not follow proper Lojban grammar.
15. Therefore, (A) is the better answer because it has a clear structure and meaning, while (B) is ambiguous and grammatically incorrect.
16. As a Lojban expert, I strongly recommend choosing (A) as the correct answer.

(A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko
(B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) is the better answer, let's first break down the components of each sentence.
2. (A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko (B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""sumti selbri sumti"", where ""sumti"" are the arguments and ""selbri"" is the relation between them.
3. In both sentences, ""le jukpa"" is a sumti, which refers to ""the cook"" or ""the one who is cooking"".
4. The word ""broda"" is a placeholder verb, which can represent any action or relation.
5. The word ""ko"" is an imperative command, instructing the listener to do something.
6. Now, let's analyze the differences between the two sentences.
7. In sentence (A), ""cu"" is used to separate the sumti ""le jukpa"" from the selbri ""broda"".
8. However, the placement of ""fi"" before ""ko"" is incorrect, as ""fi"" is a preposition that should be followed by a sumti, not a command like ""ko"".
9. This makes sentence (A) ungrammatical.
10. On the other hand, sentence (B) has a different structure.
11. The word ""fi"" is followed by ""cu"", which is an unusual but valid construction.
12. In this case, ""fi cu"" acts as a preposition that introduces a new sumti, which is ""le jukpa"".
13. The selbri ""broda"" then follows, and the sentence ends with the command ""ko"".
14. This structure is grammatical and conveys the intended meaning: ""Do the action (broda) with the cook (le jukpa).""
15. Therefore, based on the grammatical structure and the intended meaning, the correct answer is (B) ""fi cu le jukpa broda ko"".
16. While this may not be the most common way to express this idea in Lojban, it is still a valid and grammatical construction.

(B) di'u goi li pa cu merli

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) goi li pa cu merli di'u.
2. In Lojban, the word order is flexible, but there are certain rules that must be followed.
3. One of these rules is that the goi construction, which is used to specify a name or description, must come before the word it is modifying.
4. In this case, the goi construction is ""goi li pa"", which specifies the number one.
5. Therefore, it must come before the word it is modifying, which is ""merli di'u"", meaning ""counts this"".
6. If we were to switch the word order and say ""di'u goi li pa cu merli"", we would be violating this rule and creating an ungrammatical sentence.
7. So, the correct answer is (A) goi li pa cu merli di'u.
8. It's important to pay attention to the order of words in Lojban, as it can greatly affect the meaning of a sentence.

(B) mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer and (B) is not, let's break down the structure and meaning of each sentence.
2. (A) terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu This sentence can be translated as ""I will be afraid of the event of resting on a pole in an unspecified manner.""
3. The structure of this sentence is as follows: - ""terpa"" means ""to be afraid"" - ""le nu"" introduces an event - ""vau"" is a terminator that closes the ""nu"" construct - ""vreta"" means ""to rest"" - ""zu'i"" is a placeholder for an unspecified manner - ""grana"" means ""pole"" - ""ba"" indicates future tense - ""mi"" means ""I"" - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the ""le nu"" construct - ""cu"" is a separator that clarifies the relationship between the verb and the object (B) mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa This sentence can be translated as ""I, in an unspecified manner, will be the event of a pole resting, and then be afraid.""
4. The structure of this sentence is as follows: - ""mi"" means ""I"" - ""zu'i"" is a placeholder for an unspecified manner - ""cu"" is a separator that clarifies the relationship between the verb and the object - ""nu"" introduces an event - ""le grana"" means ""the pole"" - ""ba"" indicates future tense - ""vreta"" means ""to rest"" - ""vau"" is a terminator that closes the ""nu"" construct - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the ""le nu"" construct - ""terpa"" means ""to be afraid"" As you can see, sentence (A) is a more coherent and logical statement, while sentence (B) has a confusing structure and does not convey a clear meaning.
5. In (A), the fear is clearly related to the event of resting on a pole, whereas in (B), the fear seems unrelated to the event and is mentioned only after the event of the pole resting.
6. Therefore, it is clear that (A) terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu is the better answer, as it is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence that conveys a clear meaning.

A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu
(B) mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer and (B) is not, let's break down the structure and meaning of each sentence.
2. (A) terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu This sentence can be translated as ""I will be afraid of the event of resting on a pole in an unspecified manner.""
3. The structure of this sentence is as follows: - ""terpa"" means ""to be afraid"" - ""le nu"" introduces an event - ""vau"" is a terminator that closes the ""nu"" construct - ""vreta"" means ""to rest"" - ""zu'i"" is a placeholder for an unspecified manner - ""grana"" means ""pole"" - ""ba"" indicates future tense - ""mi"" means ""I"" - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the ""le nu"" construct - ""cu"" is a separator that clarifies the relationship between the verb and the object (B) mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa This sentence can be translated as ""I, in an unspecified manner, will be the event of a pole resting, and then be afraid.""
4. The structure of this sentence is as follows: - ""mi"" means ""I"" - ""zu'i"" is a placeholder for an unspecified manner - ""cu"" is a separator that clarifies the relationship between the verb and the object - ""nu"" introduces an event - ""le grana"" means ""the pole"" - ""ba"" indicates future tense - ""vreta"" means ""to rest"" - ""vau"" is a terminator that closes the ""nu"" construct - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the ""le nu"" construct - ""terpa"" means ""to be afraid"" As you can see, sentence (A) is a more coherent and logical statement, while sentence (B) has a confusing structure and does not convey a clear meaning.
5. In (A), the fear is clearly related to the event of resting on a pole, whereas in (B), the fear seems unrelated to the event and is mentioned only after the event of the pole resting.
6. Therefore, it is clear that (A) terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu is the better answer, as it is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence that conveys a clear meaning.
7. On the other hand, (B) mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa is not a valid Lojban sentence and does not convey a clear meaning.

(B) le banli cu clite loi senta

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is the better answer.
3. (A) senta clite le banli cu loi In this sentence, ""senta"" means ""layer,"" ""clite"" means ""polite,"" ""le banli"" means ""the great,"" and ""cu"" is a separator between the subject and the predicate.
4. ""loi"" is a quantifier that refers to a mass of things.
5. However, the sentence structure is incorrect, as it places ""clite"" before ""le banli,"" which doesn't make sense in Lojban grammar.
6. It would be like saying ""polite layer the great is a mass of"" in English, which is not a coherent statement.
7. (B) le banli cu clite loi senta In this sentence, ""le banli"" is the subject, meaning ""the great.""
8. ""cu"" is the separator, and ""clite"" is the predicate, meaning ""polite.""

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying meaning accurately and unambiguously.
2. Let's analyze both options to see which one is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence.
3. Option (A) ""le tapla cu lebna mu sabji"" follows the correct structure of a Lojban sentence, which is ""sumti selbri sumti"".
4. In this case, ""le tapla"" is the first sumti (subject), ""cu"" is a separator that clarifies the boundary between the subject and the predicate, ""lebna"" is the selbri (predicate), and ""mu sabji"" is the second sumti (object).
5. This sentence can be translated as ""The table takes five vegetables.""
6. Option (B) ""tapla mu le lebna sabji cu"" does not follow the correct structure of a Lojban sentence.
7. The word order is jumbled, making it difficult to identify the subject, predicate, and object.
8. Additionally, the separator ""cu"" is misplaced at the end of the sentence, which further adds to the confusion.
9. Based on this analysis, it is clear that option (A) ""le tapla cu lebna mu sabji"" is a better answer than option (B) ""tapla mu le lebna sabji cu"" because it follows the correct structure of a Lojban sentence and conveys a clear, unambiguous meaning.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the two options and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. Option (A) reads: ""se .i cu dapma racli le"" Option (B) reads: "".i le se dapma cu racli"" First, let's look at option (B).
3. The sentence starts with "".i"", which is a simple sentence separator in Lojban.
4. It is typically used to separate two sentences, but in this case, there is no preceding sentence, which makes the use of "".i"" at the beginning of the sentence unusual and potentially incorrect.
5. Now, let's examine option (A).
6. The sentence starts with ""se"", which is a conversion operator in Lojban.
7. It is used to change the order of the arguments in a predicate.
8. In this case, it is followed by "".i"", which, as mentioned earlier, is a sentence separator.
9. However, in this context, it is used correctly, as it separates the conversion operator ""se"" from the rest of the sentence.
10. Next, we have ""cu"", which is a separator used to prevent ambiguity in Lojban sentences.
11. It is followed by ""dapma"", which is a verb meaning ""to curse"" or ""to damn"".
12. Then, we have ""racli"", which means ""rational"" or ""reasonable"", and finally, ""le"", which is a definite article meaning ""the"".

2. However, let me explain why (B) is actually the better choice.
3. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is quite flexible, and it's important to understand the roles of each word in the sentence.

5. Now, let's take a look at option (B), ""sunla krasi te le cu.""

7. ""Sunla"" refers to hair, ""krasi"" means to cross or intersect, and ""te"" is a particle that indicates a relationship between the following words.
8. So, in this case, ""le cu"" is actually a clever way of expressing a specific, yet undefined, object or concept.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante is the better answer, let's break down the components of both sentences and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""selbri"" (predicate) followed by ""sumti"" (arguments).
3. The selbri is the core of the sentence, describing the relationship between the sumti.
4. (A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe In this sentence, ""zu'i"" is a sumti, meaning ""the typical value"" or ""as expected.""
5. ""Le xance pante"" translates to ""the hand pants,"" which is an unusual combination of words.
6. ""Ku"" is an elidable terminator, used to mark the end of a construct.
7. Finally, ""plipe"" is a selbri, meaning ""to jump"" or ""to leap.""
8. The issue with this sentence is that the selbri ""plipe"" comes at the end, after the sumti and the terminator ""ku.""
9. This is not a valid Lojban sentence structure, as the selbri should come before the sumti.
10. (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante In this sentence, ""ku"" is again an elidable terminator, but its placement at the beginning of the sentence is more appropriate.
11. ""Zu'i"" is still a sumti, and ""xance plipe"" now functions as a selbri, meaning ""to jump with the hand.""
12. Finally, ""le pante"" translates to ""the pants.""
13. This sentence structure is more grammatically correct in Lojban, as the selbri ""xance plipe"" comes before the sumti ""le pante.""
14. The sentence can be interpreted as ""As expected, the hand jumps with the pants,"" which, while still unusual, is a valid Lojban sentence.
15. Therefore, (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante is the better answer, as it follows the correct Lojban sentence structure.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) le ku srana cu lo cerda drani
(B) lo srana ku le drani cu cerda

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's break down both options and see why (A) is a better answer than (B).
3. (A) le ku srana cu lo cerda drani (B) lo srana ku le drani cu cerda First, let's analyze option (A).
4. In this sentence, ""le ku srana"" refers to ""the thing which is related,"" and ""cu"" is a separator that helps to clarify the structure of the sentence.
5. Next, ""lo cerda drani"" refers to ""the correct heir.""
6. So, the sentence can be translated as ""The thing which is related is the correct heir.""
7. Now, let's look at option (B).
8. In this sentence, ""lo srana ku"" refers to ""the related thing,"" and ""le drani cu cerda"" refers to ""the correct one is the heir.""
9. However, the structure of this sentence is problematic because ""ku"" is used incorrectly.
10. In Lojban, ""ku"" is used to close a description started by ""le"" or ""lo,"" but in this case, it is placed after ""srana,"" which disrupts the intended meaning of the sentence.
11. Therefore, option (A) is a better answer than (B) because it follows the correct structure and conveys the intended meaning more accurately.
12. Option (B) is wrong due to the incorrect usage of ""ku,"" which makes the sentence grammatically incorrect and confusing.
13. So, you should choose (A) as the correct answer.

(A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko
(B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) is the better answer, let's first break down the components of each sentence.
2. (A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko (B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""sumti selbri sumti"", where ""sumti"" are the arguments and ""selbri"" is the relation between them.
3. In both sentences, ""le jukpa"" is a sumti, which refers to ""the cook"" or ""the one who is cooking"".
4. The word ""broda"" is a placeholder verb, which can represent any action or relation.
5. The word ""ko"" is an imperative command, instructing the listener to do something.
6. Now, let's analyze the differences between the two sentences.
7. In sentence (A), ""cu"" is used to separate the sumti ""le jukpa"" from the selbri ""broda"".
8. However, the placement of ""fi"" before ""ko"" is incorrect, as ""fi"" is a preposition that should be followed by a sumti, not a command like ""ko"".
9. This makes sentence (A) ungrammatical.
10. On the other hand, sentence (B) has a different structure.
11. The word ""fi"" is followed by ""cu"", which is an unusual but valid construction.
12. In this case, ""fi cu"" acts as a preposition that introduces a new sumti, which is ""le jukpa"".
13. The selbri ""broda"" then follows, and the sentence ends with the command ""ko"".
14. This structure is grammatical and conveys the intended meaning: ""Do the action (broda) with the cook (le jukpa).""
15. Therefore, based on the grammatical structure and the intended meaning, the correct answer is (B) ""fi cu le jukpa broda ko"".

9. Based on this analysis, it is clear that option (B) is the better answer, as it is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence, while option (A) is not.
10. Even if you are not familiar with Lojban, you can see that option (B) has a more coherent structure and follows a logical pattern, making it the correct choice.

(B) mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) is the correct answer, let's break down both sentences and analyze their structures.
2. (A) terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu (B) mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa First, let's look at the structure of (A).
3. The sentence starts with ""terpa,"" which means ""to fear.""
4. However, the rest of the sentence is quite jumbled and doesn't follow proper Lojban grammar.
5. The phrase ""le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu"" is not a well-formed sumti, which is required to follow ""terpa.""
6. The use of ""vau"" and ""kei"" in this sentence is also incorrect, as they are not used in the proper context.
7. Now, let's examine (B).
8. The sentence starts with ""mi,"" which means ""I"" or ""me.""
9. This is followed by ""zu'i,"" which is a sumti that refers to the typical or expected value.
10. The next part of the sentence, ""cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei,"" is a well-formed sumti that describes an event of lying down with a stick.
11. Finally, the sentence ends with ""terpa,"" which means ""to fear.""
12. So, the sentence (B) can be translated as ""I, as expected, fear the event of lying down with a stick.""
13. This sentence is grammatically correct and makes logical sense in Lojban.
14. In conclusion, (B) ""mi zu'i cu nu le grana ba vreta vau kei terpa"" is the correct answer because it follows proper Lojban grammar and structure, while (A) ""terpa le nu vau vreta zu'i grana ba mi kei cu"" is incorrect due to its jumbled structure and improper use of certain Lojban words.

Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje
(B) se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku

Proposed solution:
1. First, let me explain the basic structure of a Lojban sentence.
2. In Lojban, the subject comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object.
3. Additionally, Lojban uses specific particles to indicate the relationships between words and phrases.
4. Now, let's analyze the two options: (A) ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje (B) se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku In option (A), ""ko'a cu"" indicates the subject, ""batke be"" is the verb, and ""le kakne ku be'o se cinje"" is the object.
5. However, there is a problem with this structure.
6. The particle ""be'o"" is used to close the ""be"" construction, but it is misplaced in this sentence, making it ungrammatical.
7. On the other hand, option (B) has a more logical structure.
8. ""se cu be"" is the subject, ""cinje kakne"" is the verb, and ""le batke be'o ko'a ku"" is the object.
9. The particle ""be'o"" is correctly placed in this sentence, closing the ""be"" construction and making it grammatically correct.
10. Furthermore, the use of ""se"" in option (B) indicates a change in the order of the arguments, which is a common and valid technique in Lojban to emphasize a particular aspect of the sentence.
11. In conclusion, option (B) ""se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku"" is a better answer than option (A) ""ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje"" because it follows the correct grammatical structure and uses the appropriate particles.
12. Option (A) is incorrect due to the misplaced ""be'o"" particle, which makes the sentence ungrammatical.

(B) le banli cu clite loi senta

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is the better answer.
3. (A) senta clite le banli cu loi In this sentence, ""senta"" means ""layer,"" ""clite"" means ""polite,"" ""le banli"" means ""the great,"" and ""cu"" is a separator between the subject and the predicate.
4. ""loi"" is a quantifier that refers to a mass of things.
5. However, the sentence structure is incorrect, as it places ""clite"" before ""le banli,"" which doesn't make sense in Lojban grammar.
6. It would be like saying ""polite layer the great is a mass of"" in English, which is not a coherent statement.
7. (B) le banli cu clite loi senta In this sentence, ""le banli"" is the subject, meaning ""the great.""
8. ""cu"" is the separator, and ""clite"" is the predicate, meaning ""polite.""
9. ""loi senta"" refers to a mass of layers.
10. The sentence structure is correct, and it translates to ""the great is polite in terms of a mass of layers"" in English.
11. This sentence is grammatically valid and conveys a coherent meaning.
12. Therefore, (B) le banli cu clite loi senta is the better answer, as it follows the correct Lojban grammar and conveys a clear meaning.
