A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la djan. cu se flira
(B) djan. la cu flira se

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) la djan. cu se flira.
2. This is because in Lojban, the subject comes before the predicate.
3. In (A), ""la djan."" is the subject and ""se flira"" is the predicate, so the sentence is grammatically correct.
4. However, in (B), ""djan."" is the predicate and ""la cu flira se"" is the subject, which is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
5. Therefore, (B) is the incorrect answer.
6. Additionally, the use of ""la"" in (A) is more appropriate because it is used to refer to a specific individual, while ""cu"" is used to indicate the start of the predicate.
7. So, (A) is not only grammatically correct but also more precise in its use of language.
8. In conclusion, (A) la djan. cu se flira is the correct answer and (B) djan. la cu flira se is incorrect.
