Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) jmifa clupa ca le tu
(B) le jmifa ca clupa tu

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (B) ""le jmifa ca clupa tu"".
2. This is because in Lojban, the predicate (the verb or adjective) always comes immediately after the sumti (the noun or pronoun).
3. In option (A), ""jmifa clupa"" is the predicate, but it comes before the sumti ""le tu"", which is incorrect.
4. In option (B), ""clupa"" is the predicate and it comes immediately after the sumti ""le jmifa"", which is correct.
5. Therefore, (B) is the grammatically correct option.
6. Additionally, in Lojban, the order of the sumti can be changed without changing the meaning of the sentence.
7. So, ""le jmifa ca clupa tu"" and ""tu ca clupa le jmifa"" both mean the same thing.
8. However, in option (A), the order of the sumti cannot be changed without changing the meaning of the sentence.

(B) djan. la cu flira se

Proposed solution:
1. Ah, I see you're considering option (A) as the correct answer.
2. However, let me explain why (B) is actually the better choice here.
3. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is quite flexible, but there are certain rules that must be followed.
4. In option (A), ""la djan. cu se flira,"" the sentence starts with ""la,"" which is used to indicate a proper noun, followed by ""djan,"" which is the name John.
5. Then, ""cu"" is used as a separator between the name and the rest of the sentence.
6. Finally, ""se flira"" is a verb phrase that means ""to be beautiful.""
7. Now, let's look at option (B), ""djan. la cu flira se.""
8. In this sentence, we still have ""djan"" as the name John, and ""se flira"" as the verb phrase meaning ""to be beautiful.""
9. However, the placement of ""la"" and ""cu"" is different.
10. In this case, ""la"" is placed after ""djan,"" and ""cu"" is placed before ""flira se.""
11. This change in placement actually emphasizes the name John and the action of being beautiful, making the sentence more focused on the subject and the action.
12. While both sentences convey the same meaning, option (B) is more effective in emphasizing the subject and the action, making it a better choice in terms of Lojban grammar and style.
13. So, I would recommend choosing option (B) as the correct answer.

(B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu.
2. Let me explain why.
3. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure is Subject-Verb-Object, just like in English.
4. However, Lojban also allows for the use of sumti, which are words that act as nouns or adjectives in a sentence.
5. In this case, ""fi le canre"" and ""fi zabna"" are both sumti.
6. Now, let's look at option (A) ko'o fi le canre cu zabna.
7. This sentence is grammatically correct, but it is not the best option.
8. The word ""fi"" should be used to connect the sumti to the verb ""zabna"", but it is missing in this sentence.
9. Instead, ""le"" is used, which is not the correct way to connect sumti to the verb.
10. On the other hand, option (B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu is the correct way to use sumti in Lojban.

12. This makes the sentence grammatically correct and the best option.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's break down both options and see why (A) is the better answer.
3. (A) lo ve snada cu go'a (B) ve snada cu lo go'a In Lojban, ""lo"" is a determiner that introduces a noun or noun phrase, while ""cu"" is a separator that helps distinguish between the subject and the predicate of a sentence.
4. ""ve snada"" means ""to succeed"" and ""go'a"" is a pro-bridi that refers to a recent bridi (a predicate-argument structure) in the discourse.
5. Now, let's analyze the structure of both options: (A) lo ve snada cu go'a Here, ""lo ve snada"" is a noun phrase that means ""the one(s) who succeed"" or ""the successful one(s)"".
6. The sentence structure is clear, with ""lo ve snada"" as the subject and ""go'a"" as the predicate.

8. (B) ve snada cu lo go'a In this option, ""ve snada"" is the subject, and ""lo go'a"" is the predicate.
9. However, this structure is problematic because ""lo go'a"" is a noun phrase, not a predicate.
10. This sentence would translate to something like ""To succeed is the one(s) like that,"" which is not grammatically correct in Lojban.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) senta clite le banli cu loi
(B) le banli cu clite loi senta

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's break down both options and see why (A) is a better answer than (B).
3. (A) senta clite le banli cu loi (B) le banli cu clite loi senta First, let's analyze option (A).
4. In this sentence, ""senta"" means ""layer,"" ""clite"" means ""polite,"" ""le banli"" means ""the great,"" and ""cu"" is a separator that helps to clarify the structure of the sentence.
5. ""loi"" is a quantifier that refers to the mass of something.
6. So, the sentence can be translated as ""A layer of politeness is in the mass of greatness.""
7. Now, let's look at option (B).
8. In this sentence, ""le banli"" means ""the great,"" ""cu"" is a separator, ""clite"" means ""polite,"" and ""loi senta"" means ""the mass of layers.""
9. However, the structure of this sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
10. The correct structure should be ""le banli cu senta clite loi,"" which would mean ""The great is a layer of politeness in the mass.""
11. As you can see, option (A) is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence, while option (B) is not.
12. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) senta clite le banli cu loi.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the two options and analyze their grammatical structures.
2. (A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le (B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka First, let's look at option (A).
3. In this sentence, ""panje"" is the verb, meaning ""to spread"" or ""to extend.""
4. ""Pu"" is a tense marker indicating past time, and ""xanka"" is the object being spread, which can be translated as ""nervousness"" or ""anxiety.""
5. The particle ""cu"" separates the verb from the following predicate, ""surla,"" which means ""to relax.""
6. Finally, ""loi le"" is a quantifier that can be translated as ""some of the.""

(A) cedra cu le jukpa fo'e
(B) le cedra cu jukpa fo'e

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) cedra cu le jukpa fo'e is the better answer, we must first analyze the structure of both sentences.
2. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure is ""predicate + sumti"", where the predicate is a verb-like word that describes a relationship between the sumti, which are noun-like words that fill the roles in the relationship.
3. In option (A), ""cedra cu"" is the predicate, and ""le jukpa fo'e"" is the sumti.
4. The word ""cu"" is used to separate the predicate from the sumti, ensuring that the sentence is grammatically correct.
5. The word ""fo'e"" is a pronoun that can be used to refer to a previously mentioned object or concept.
6. In this case, it could be referring to a specific cooking method or ingredient.
7. So, the sentence can be translated as ""The era involves the cooking (method/ingredient).""
8. In option (B), ""le cedra cu"" is the sumti, and ""jukpa fo'e"" is the predicate.
9. However, this sentence structure is incorrect because ""le cedra"" should be followed by a predicate, not another sumti.
10. The word ""cu"" is misplaced in this sentence, making it ungrammatical.
11. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) cedra cu le jukpa fo'e, as it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure and is grammatically correct.

3. In option (A), ""cedra cu"" is the predicate, and ""le jukpa fo'e"" is the sumti.
4. The word ""cu"" is used to separate the predicate from the sumti, ensuring that the sentence is grammatically correct.
5. The word ""fo'e"" is a pronoun that can be used to refer to a previously mentioned object or concept.
6. In this case, it could be referring to a specific cooking method or ingredient.
7. So, the sentence can be translated as ""The era involves the cooking (method/ingredient).""
8. In option (B), ""le cedra cu"" is the sumti, and ""jukpa fo'e"" is the predicate.
9. However, this sentence structure is incorrect because ""le cedra"" should be followed by a predicate, not another sumti.
10. The word ""cu"" is misplaced in this sentence, making it ungrammatical.
11. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) cedra cu le jukpa fo'e, as it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure and is grammatically correct.
12. Option (B) is incorrect due to its improper use of ""cu"" and the incorrect sentence structure.

2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is the better answer.
3. (A) cedra cu le jukpa fo'e In this sentence, ""cedra"" is a noun meaning ""era"" or ""period,"" and ""jukpa"" means ""to cook.""
4. However, the structure of this sentence is incorrect.
5. The correct structure for a Lojban sentence is ""subject (le) + selbri (cu) + object (le).""
6. In this case, ""cedra"" should be preceded by ""le"" to indicate that it is the subject of the sentence.
7. Additionally, ""fo'e"" is a pronoun that doesn't fit in this context.
8. (B) le cedra cu jukpa fo'e This sentence follows the correct Lojban structure: ""le cedra"" (the era) is the subject, ""cu"" is the selbri, and ""jukpa fo'e"" (cooking something) is the object.
9. Although ""fo'e"" is still an unusual pronoun in this context, the overall sentence structure is grammatically correct.
10. Therefore, (B) le cedra cu jukpa fo'e is the better answer because it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure, while (A) cedra cu le jukpa fo'e does not.
