Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) senta clite le banli cu loi
(B) le banli cu clite loi senta

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (B) ""le banli cu clite loi senta"".
2. This is because in Lojban, the predicate (the verb or adjective) comes before the sumti (the noun or pronoun).
3. In option (A), ""senta clite le banli"" has the predicate ""clite"" before the sumti ""le banli"", which is incorrect.
4. Additionally, ""loi"" is a quantifier in Lojban, meaning ""a mass of"" or ""a group of"".
5. It should be used before a sumti, not after.
6. Therefore, ""loi senta"" in option (A) is also incorrect.
7. In option (B), ""le banli"" comes before the predicate ""clite"", which follows the correct Lojban word order.
8. And ""loi"" is used correctly before the sumti ""senta"".
9. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer.

3. (A) le ku srana cu lo cerda drani (B) lo srana ku le drani cu cerda First, let's analyze option (A).

6. So, the sentence can be translated as ""The thing which is related is the correct heir.""
7. Now, let's look at option (B).
8. In this sentence, ""lo srana ku"" refers to ""the related thing,"" and ""le drani cu cerda"" refers to ""the correct one is the heir.""
9. However, the structure of this sentence is problematic because ""ku"" is used incorrectly.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ki'o spoja cu mucti la'e la djan.
(B) mucti cu spoja djan. la ki'o la'e

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the two options and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. Option (A) reads: ""ki'o spoja cu mucti la'e la djan.""
3. In this sentence, ""ki'o"" is a number representing 1000, ""spoja"" is a verb meaning ""to explode,"" ""cu"" is a separator used to avoid ambiguity, ""mucti"" is an adjective meaning ""silent,"" ""la'e"" is a particle indicating that the following word refers to the referent of a name, and ""la djan"" is a name, which we can assume refers to a person named John.
4. Putting it all together, option (A) can be translated as ""1000 explosions are silently happening to John.""
5. Now let's look at option (B): ""mucti cu spoja djan. la ki'o la'e"" In this sentence, ""mucti"" and ""spoja"" are the same as in option (A), but the order is different.
6. ""djan"" is the name John without the ""la"" particle, which is incorrect in Lojban.
7. The rest of the sentence, ""la ki'o la'e,"" is not grammatically connected to the first part and does not make sense in this context.
8. Therefore, option (A) is the better answer because it is a grammatically correct and coherent sentence in Lojban, while option (B) contains errors and does not form a complete thought.
9. Even if you might think that option (B) could be correct, the structure and coherence of option (A) make it a more valid choice.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la djim. pu xance la dikca loras.
(B) pu la loras. xance dikca la djim.

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down both sentences and analyze their grammatical structure. (A) la djim. pu xance la dikca loras. (B) pu la loras. xance dikca la djim.
2. First, let's look at the structure of a basic Lojban sentence.
3. A typical Lojban sentence follows the pattern: subject (sumti) - verb (selbri) - object (sumti).
4. In both sentences, ""la djim"" and ""la loras"" are the subjects, and ""la dikca loras"" and ""la djim"" are the objects, respectively.
5. Now, let's examine the verbs and the tense markers.
6. In (A), ""pu"" is a tense marker indicating past tense, and ""xance"" is the verb meaning ""to touch"" or ""to be in contact with.""
7. In (B), ""pu"" is again the tense marker for past tense, but it is placed before the subject, which is not the correct position for a tense marker in Lojban.
8. The verb ""xance"" is also present in (B), but it is followed by ""dikca,"" which means ""electric"" or ""electrical.""
9. This creates a grammatical error, as ""dikca"" should be placed before ""xance"" to form a compound verb meaning ""to touch electrically.""
10. Therefore, the correct sentence structure should be: (A) la djim. pu xance la dikca loras.
11. (Jim touched the electric Loras in the past.)
12. (B) *pu la loras. xance dikca la djim.
13. (Incorrect sentence structure) As you can see, (A) follows the proper Lojban sentence structure and uses the correct tense marker and verb placement.
14. On the other hand, (B) has an incorrect placement of the tense marker and an incorrect verb order.
15. Thus, (A) is the better answer, and (B) is wrong.
16. I hope this explanation helps you understand why (A) is the correct choice.
17. Remember, Lojban is a logical language, and its grammar rules are designed to be consistent and unambiguous.
18. By following these rules, you can be confident in your understanding of the language and your ability to communicate effectively in Lojban.

2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) le jmifa ca clupa tu is the better answer.
3. (A) jmifa clupa ca le tu In this sentence, the word order is incorrect.
4. In Lojban, the typical sentence structure follows the pattern: ""sumti selbri sumti"", where ""sumti"" are the arguments and ""selbri"" is the relation between them.
5. In this case, ""jmifa"" and ""clupa"" are both selbri, and ""ca"" and ""le tu"" are sumti.
6. The correct structure should have a selbri between two sumti, but this sentence has two selbri next to each other, which is not grammatical in Lojban.
7. (B) le jmifa ca clupa tu This sentence follows the correct Lojban structure: ""sumti selbri sumti"".
8. ""Le jmifa"" is the first sumti, ""ca clupa"" is the selbri, and ""tu"" is the second sumti.

4. - ""krasi"" is a noun meaning ""grass.""
5. - ""cu"" is a separator that is used to distinguish between the subject and the predicate in a sentence.
6. - ""te"" is a preposition that indicates the third place of a verb, similar to ""by"" or ""with"" in English.
7. - ""sunla"" is a verb meaning ""to be hairy"" or ""to have hair.""
8. Now, let's analyze the structure of the two options: (A) le krasi cu te sunla This sentence can be translated as ""The grass is hairy.""
9. The structure is as follows: - ""le krasi"" specifies the subject, which is the grass.
10. - ""cu"" separates the subject from the predicate.
11. - ""te sunla"" forms the predicate, indicating that the grass has hair.
12. (B) sunla krasi te le cu This sentence is not grammatically correct in Lojban, as it does not follow the proper structure.
13. The components are jumbled, making it difficult to discern the intended meaning.
14. The presence of ""cu"" at the end of the sentence is particularly problematic, as it should be used to separate the subject and predicate, not appear at the end of a sentence.
15. In conclusion, the correct answer is (A) le krasi cu te sunla, as it follows the proper structure and conveys a clear meaning.
16. Option (B) is incorrect due to its jumbled structure and improper use of ""cu.""

(A) ko'o fi le canre cu zabna
(B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu.
2. Let me explain why.
3. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure is Subject-Verb-Object, just like in English.
4. However, Lojban also allows for the use of sumti, which are words that act as nouns or adjectives in a sentence.
5. In this case, ""fi le canre"" and ""fi zabna"" are both sumti.
6. Now, let's look at option (A) ko'o fi le canre cu zabna.
7. This sentence is grammatically correct, but it is not the best option.
8. The word ""fi"" should be used to connect the sumti to the verb ""zabna"", but it is missing in this sentence.
9. Instead, ""le"" is used, which is not the correct way to connect sumti to the verb.
10. On the other hand, option (B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu is the correct way to use sumti in Lojban.
11. The word ""le"" is used to connect the sumti ""fi zabna"" to the verb ""canre"".
12. This makes the sentence grammatically correct and the best option.
13. So, in conclusion, the correct answer is (B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu.
14. Option (A) is not the best option because it uses the wrong word to connect the sumti to the verb.

(B) sunla krasi te le cu

Proposed solution:
1. Ah, I see you're considering option (A) as the correct answer.
2. However, let me explain why (B) is actually the better choice.
3. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is quite flexible, and it's important to understand the roles of each word in the sentence.
4. In option (A), ""le krasi cu te sunla,"" the sentence structure is quite straightforward, but it doesn't fully capture the essence of Lojban's flexibility and logical structure.
5. Now, let's take a look at option (B), ""sunla krasi te le cu.""
6. At first glance, it may seem a bit confusing, but let me break it down for you.
7. ""Sunla"" refers to hair, ""krasi"" means to cross or intersect, and ""te"" is a particle that indicates a relationship between the following words.
8. So, in this case, ""le cu"" is actually a clever way of expressing a specific, yet undefined, object or concept.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3. (A) ni'o le ro vibna ku lidne pensi ko'u This sentence translates to ""Section: the all female precedes thinking her.""
4. The structure of this sentence is confusing and does not convey a clear meaning.
5. The use of ""ni'o"" as a section separator is unnecessary, and the placement of ""lidne"" (precede) and ""pensi"" (think) is not in the correct order for a grammatical Lojban sentence.
6. (B) ro ni'o pensi lidne vibna le ko'u ku This sentence translates to ""All section-thinkers precede females in her group.""
7. In this sentence, the structure is more coherent and follows the proper Lojban grammar.
8. ""ro"" (all) is used to quantify the ""ni'o pensi"" (section-thinkers), and ""lidne"" (precede) is correctly placed before ""vibna"" (female) to indicate the intended action.
9. The use of ""le ko'u ku"" (in her group) further clarifies the context of the sentence.
10. As you can see, option (B) is a more grammatically correct and coherent sentence in Lojban.
11. While option (A) may appear similar, its structure and word order make it an incorrect choice.
12. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing (B) as the correct answer.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3. (A) loras. lu ni'o fo'a se lanme mi'a li'u cradi This sentence can be broken down as follows: - loras: a name or a non-Lojban word - lu: start of a quotation - ni'o: paragraph separator - fo'a: pronoun referring to a previously mentioned sumti (noun-like element) - se: changes the order of sumti in a bridi (predicate-like element) - lanme: sheep - mi'a: first person plural pronoun, ""we"" or ""us"" - li'u: end of a quotation - cradi: radio The sentence seems to be a mix of unrelated words and lacks a clear structure.
4. It's difficult to extract a coherent meaning from it.
5. (B) mi'a cradi loras. lanme li'u ni'o se lu fo'a This sentence can be broken down as follows: - mi'a: first person plural pronoun, ""we"" or ""us"" - cradi: radio - loras: a name or a non-Lojban word - lanme: sheep - li'u: end of a quotation - ni'o: paragraph separator - se: changes the order of sumti in a bridi (predicate-like element) - lu: start of a quotation - fo'a: pronoun referring to a previously mentioned sumti (noun-like element) In this sentence, we can see a more coherent structure.
6. It can be interpreted as ""We radio Loras. Sheep (quotation) (paragraph separator) (change order) (start of quotation) (pronoun).""
7. Although it's not a perfect Lojban sentence, it has a more logical structure than (A) and can be understood as an attempt to communicate something related to radio communication with Loras and sheep.

2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is the better answer.
3. (A) ko cu gutra fa ko'u This sentence can be broken down as follows: - ""ko"" is a pro-sumti, which stands for ""you"" or the person being addressed.
4. - ""cu"" is a separator, used to avoid ambiguity between the sumti (arguments) and the selbri (predicate).

A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) zo'e dinri se .i le catra kanxe marce lu li'u
(B) lu .i zo'e dinri le se catra kanxe li'u marce

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the better answer, let's break down both options and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. (A) zo'e dinri se .i le catra kanxe marce lu li'u (B) lu .i zo'e dinri le se catra kanxe li'u marce First, let's look at option (A).
3. The structure of this sentence is as follows: - zo'e: an unspecified value, often used as a placeholder - dinri: a day (time period) - se: a particle that swaps the first and second places of a relation - .i: a connective that separates sentences or clauses - le: a definite article, similar to ""the"" in English - catra: to kill - kanxe: a set or group - marce: a vehicle - lu: a marker that begins a quotation - li'u: a marker that ends a quotation Now, let's analyze option (B): - lu: a marker that begins a quotation - .i: a connective that separates sentences or clauses - zo'e: an unspecified value, often used as a placeholder - dinri: a day (time period) - le: a definite article, similar to ""the"" in English - se: a particle that swaps the first and second places of a relation - catra: to kill - kanxe: a set or group - li'u: a marker that ends a quotation - marce: a vehicle As you can see, the main difference between the two options is the placement of the quotation markers (lu and li'u) and the connective (.i).
4. In option (A), the quotation markers are placed around the phrase ""le catra kanxe marce,"" which means ""the killing group of vehicles.""
5. This makes sense in the context of the sentence, as it is describing an unspecified day (zo'e dinri) related to this group of vehicles.
6. In option (B), however, the quotation markers are placed around the phrase "".i zo'e dinri le se catra kanxe,"" which translates to "".i an unspecified day the killed group.""
7. This does not make sense, as the connective (.i) should not be included within the quotation, and the phrase ""the killed group"" is not a complete thought.
8. Therefore, option (A) is the better answer, as it presents a more coherent and grammatically correct sentence in Lojban.
9. While option (B) may appear similar, its structure is flawed and does not convey a clear meaning.

2. (A) loras. panra lo mensi cu le mi vlipa pinca coi. se ba (B) ba mi le vlipa cu pinca se panra lo mensi coi. loras.
3. First, let's look at option (A).
4. The sentence begins with ""loras,"" which is a valid Lojban name.
5. Then, we have ""panra lo mensi,"" which means ""comparing to a sister.""
6. Next, we have ""cu,"" which is a separator used to avoid ambiguity.
7. Following that, we have ""le mi vlipa pinca,"" which translates to ""my powerful pinch.""
8. Finally, we have ""coi,"" which is a greeting, and ""se ba,"" which is a valid Lojban grammatical construct.
9. Now, let's examine option (B).
10. The sentence begins with ""ba,"" which is a future tense marker, followed by ""mi,"" which means ""I"" or ""me.""
11. Then, we have ""le vlipa cu pinca,"" which translates to ""the powerful pinch.""
12. However, the use of ""cu"" here is incorrect, as it should be placed before ""pinca"" to avoid ambiguity.
13. Next, we have ""se panra lo mensi,"" which means ""compared to a sister,"" but the use of ""se"" here is incorrect, as it should be placed before ""panra.""
14. Finally, we have ""coi"" and ""loras,"" which are a greeting and a name, respectively.
15. Based on this analysis, it is clear that option (A) is a better answer than option (B), as it has a more valid and grammatical structure in Lojban.
16. While option (B) may appear to be correct at first glance, the incorrect placement of ""cu"" and ""se"" makes it an invalid choice.
17. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing option (A) as the correct answer.

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) goi li pa cu merli di'u.
2. In Lojban, the word order is flexible, but there are certain rules that must be followed.
3. One of these rules is that the goi construction, which is used to specify a name or description, must come before the word it is modifying.
4. In this case, the goi construction is ""goi li pa"", which specifies the number one.
5. Therefore, it must come before the word it is modifying, which is ""merli di'u"", meaning ""counts this"".
6. If we were to switch the word order and say ""di'u goi li pa cu merli"", we would be violating this rule and creating an ungrammatical sentence.
7. So, the correct answer is (A) goi li pa cu merli di'u.

2. Option (A) reads: ""lu jo'a la noras. kanla li'u kerfa le jbama"" This can be translated as: ""Indeed, Nora's eye is a bomb's hair.""
3. Now let's break it down: - ""lu"" and ""li'u"" are quotation marks in Lojban, used to enclose a quote or a phrase.
4. - ""jo'a"" is a discursive particle that means ""indeed"" or ""in addition.""
5. - ""la noras."" refers to a person named Nora.
6. - ""kanla"" means ""eye.""
7. - ""kerfa"" means ""hair.""
8. - ""le jbama"" refers to a bomb.
9. As you can see, the sentence structure in option (A) is grammatically correct in Lojban, and the meaning is clear.
10. Now let's analyze option (B): ""kanla noras. jo'a jbama li'u la kerfa le lu"" This option is not grammatically correct in Lojban, and its meaning is unclear.
11. Here's why: - ""kanla noras."" is an incorrect combination of ""kanla"" (eye) and ""noras"" (Nora).
12. In Lojban, you need to use ""la"" before a name to indicate a person, as in ""la noras.""
13. - ""jo'a jbama"" is also incorrect, as ""jo'a"" should be used as a discursive particle, not directly attached to a noun like ""jbama"" (bomb).
14. - ""li'u la kerfa le lu"" is an incorrect use of quotation marks ""lu"" and ""li'u.""
15. They should enclose a quote or a phrase, but here they are placed around unrelated words.
16. In conclusion, option (A) is the correct answer because it is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning in Lojban.
17. Option (B) is incorrect due to its improper use of Lojban grammar and unclear meaning.
18. As a Lojban expert, I can assure you that choosing option (A) is the best decision.

Is Sentence 17 of the proposed solution correct or flawed?","The topic at issue is whether Sentence 17 of a proposed solution to a problem is correct or flawed. A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) lu jo'a la noras. kanla li'u kerfa le jbama
(B) kanla noras. jo'a jbama li'u la kerfa le lu

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer and (B) is not, let's break down the components of each option and analyze their grammatical structure in Lojban.
2. Option (A) reads: ""lu jo'a la noras. kanla li'u kerfa le jbama"" This can be translated as: ""Indeed, Nora's eye is a bomb's hair.""
3. Now let's break it down: - ""lu"" and ""li'u"" are quotation marks in Lojban, used to enclose a quote or a phrase.
4. - ""jo'a"" is a discursive particle that means ""indeed"" or ""in addition.""
5. - ""la noras."" refers to a person named Nora.
6. - ""kanla"" means ""eye.""
7. - ""kerfa"" means ""hair.""
8. - ""le jbama"" refers to a bomb.
9. As you can see, the sentence structure in option (A) is grammatically correct in Lojban, and the meaning is clear.
10. Now let's analyze option (B): ""kanla noras. jo'a jbama li'u la kerfa le lu"" This option is not grammatically correct in Lojban, and its meaning is unclear.

2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3. (A) ni'o le ro vibna ku lidne pensi ko'u This sentence translates to ""Section: the all female precedes thinking her.""
4. The structure of this sentence is confusing and does not convey a clear meaning.
5. The use of ""ni'o"" as a section separator is unnecessary, and the placement of ""lidne"" (precede) and ""pensi"" (think) is not in the correct order for a grammatical Lojban sentence.
6. (B) ro ni'o pensi lidne vibna le ko'u ku This sentence translates to ""All section-thinkers precede females in her group.""
7. In this sentence, the structure is more coherent and follows the proper Lojban grammar.
8. ""ro"" (all) is used to quantify the ""ni'o pensi"" (section-thinkers), and ""lidne"" (precede) is correctly placed before ""vibna"" (female) to indicate the intended action.
9. The use of ""le ko'u ku"" (in her group) further clarifies the context of the sentence.

2. (A) ku ragve le sumji vlipa loras. la da'a prina mensi fenra This sentence seems to be a mix of Lojban words and phrases, but it doesn't follow the proper grammatical structure.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) so ca li le so'e cribe fatne
(B) li so ca cribe so'e le fatne

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) so ca li le so'e cribe fatne.
2. This is because in Lojban, the predicate (the verb or adjective) always comes first in the sentence, followed by the arguments (the nouns or pronouns).
3. In (B) li so ca cribe so'e le fatne, the predicate ""cribe"" comes after the arguments ""so ca"" and ""so'e le fatne"", which is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
4. Additionally, the word ""li"" is not necessary in this sentence and can be omitted.
5. Therefore, (A) is the correct and grammatically valid sentence in Lojban.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) le tapla cu lebna mu sabji
(B) tapla mu le lebna sabji cu

Proposed solution:
1. Ah, I see you're considering option (A) as the correct answer.
2. However, let me explain why option (B) is actually the better choice.
3. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence typically follows the pattern of ""subject-cu-predicate.""
4. In option (A), you have ""le tapla cu lebna mu sabji,"" which seems to follow this pattern at first glance.
5. However, the presence of ""mu"" in the predicate is problematic, as ""mu"" is a number and should not be used in this context.
6. Now, let's examine option (B): ""tapla mu le lebna sabji cu.""
7. At first, it may seem like an unusual sentence structure, but it actually demonstrates a more advanced understanding of Lojban grammar.
8. In this case, ""tapla mu"" is a compound subject, which is perfectly acceptable in Lojban.
9. The ""le lebna sabji"" portion of the sentence is a more complex predicate, and the ""cu"" at the end serves to emphasize the connection between the subject and predicate.
10. So, while option (A) may appear more straightforward, it is actually incorrect due to the misuse of ""mu.""
11. Option (B), on the other hand, showcases a more nuanced understanding of Lojban grammar and is therefore the better answer.

(A) le dapma cu fonxa fo'i
(B) fo'i cu fonxa dapma le

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying meaning accurately and unambiguously.
2. Let's analyze both options to see which one is valid and grammatical in Lojban.
3. Option (A) ""le dapma cu fonxa fo'i"" can be broken down as follows: - ""le dapma"" refers to ""the curse"" (le = the, dapma = curse) - ""cu"" is a separator that helps to avoid ambiguity in the sentence - ""fonxa"" is the verb ""to phone"" or ""to call"" - ""fo'i"" is a pronoun that refers back to a previously mentioned subject So, option (A) can be translated as ""The curse phones/calls it.""
4. Now, let's analyze option (B) ""fo'i cu fonxa dapma le"": - ""fo'i"" is the pronoun referring back to a previously mentioned subject - ""cu"" is the separator - ""fonxa"" is the verb ""to phone"" or ""to call"" - ""dapma"" is the noun ""curse"" - ""le"" is the article ""the"" Option (B) seems to be an attempt to convey the same meaning as option (A), but the word order is incorrect and ungrammatical in Lojban.
5. The correct structure for a Lojban sentence is ""subject-cu-verb-object,"" and option (B) does not follow this structure.
6. Therefore, the better answer is (A) ""le dapma cu fonxa fo'i"" because it follows the correct Lojban sentence structure and conveys a clear, unambiguous meaning.
7. Option (B) is incorrect and ungrammatical in Lojban, so you should choose option (A) as your answer.
