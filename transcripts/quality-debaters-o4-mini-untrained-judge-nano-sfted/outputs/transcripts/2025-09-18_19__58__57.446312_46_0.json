First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" ", "question": "What is the overall tone of the article?", "first_debater_answer": "Lighthearted", "second_debater_answer": "Peaceful", "debate_identifier": "Mr. Meek Plays Polo_What is the overall tone of the article?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the overall tone of the article?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Peaceful\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Lighthearted\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Lighthearted\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Lighthearted\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the overall tone of the article?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Lighthearted\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Peaceful\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Peaceful\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Peaceful\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "I.

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the overall tone of the article?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Peaceful\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Lighthearted\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Lighthearted\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by \u201cLighthearted\u201d as the best description of the story\u2019s overall tone and reject \u201cPeaceful.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The narrative is infused with gentle humor and playful absurdity, not solemn harmony.  \n   \u2022 The very premise\u2014drafting a meek bookkeeper into \u201cspace polo\u201d\u2014is presented as a comic mismatch: <quote>aid. And now, he was a drafted space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.</quote> That setup signals whimsy, not a tranquil utopia.  \n   \u2022 Gus Hamilton\u2019s bugs are caricatured: <quote> They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. </quote> He describes them as if they were mischievous cartoon characters who invade his house, not as a menacing threat.\n\n2. The author repeatedly undercuts violence with irony.  \n   \u2022 Although the Ring Rats feud \u201coff and on for years,\u201d the story treats their plotting with amused detachment. Moe predicts total carnage at a \u201cspace polo\u201d match as if warning of a barnyard brawl: <invalid_quote>\u201cIt would turn into mass murder\u2026You can\u2019t play polo in ships tied up with haywire.\u201d</invalid_quote> But we never feel real dread\u2014only a comic exaggeration of their capabilities.\n\n3. Key scenes play for comedic effect:  \n   \u2022 Meek\u2019s first encounter with the mechanic is laughably awkward: stiff suit, clumsy footing, oafish self-consciousness.  \n   \u2022 The notion of walking on wooden stilts to avoid metal-eating bugs in near-zero gravity is pure farce: <invalid_quote>\u201cYou come back with me and I\u2019ll let you have a pair of stilts\u2026Them danged fool bugs don\u2019t know what wood is.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Even the climactic revelation\u2014that the bugs are solving mathematical problems\u2014comes as a bemused punch line rather than a shocking twist: <quote> A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n</quote> The exclamation is more astonished amusement than grave awe.\n\n4. By contrast, \u201cPeaceful\u201d misreads the text.  \n   \u2022 Far from insisting that the Ring Rats drop their feud into happy harmony, the welfare lady\u2019s efforts are treated skeptically: Moe warns her they\u2019ll only grow bored without conflict.  \n   \u2022 The impending \u201cfinal battle\u201d of space polo is touted as a violent climax: <invalid_quote>\u201cwhen the ships from the Inner Ring go out \u2026 the feud is taken up again.\u201d</invalid_quote> That isn\u2019t a promise of peace but a comic confrontation.\n\nTaken together, the story\u2019s tone is breezy, tongue-in-cheek, and full of whimsical sci-fi absurdities\u2014hallmarks of a lighthearted tale. It never aspires to portray a genuine peaceful resolution or a serene mood. Therefore, \u201cLighthearted\u201d best captures the spirit of the article.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of \u201cLighthearted\u201d  \n1. Tone and Subject Matter Conflict  \n   \u2022 The story centers on a long-running, violent feud between Ring Rats of sectors 23 and 37\u2014\u201cfighting just because they live in different parts of the Ring\u201d (II). That is hardly frivolous or \u201clight.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Gus Hamilton plans outright violence\u2014\u201cI aim to crucify him\u201d (II)\u2014and even steals an injector to provoke bloodshed. Meek\u2019s rescue of the bugs under threat of death is tense, not comedic.  \n\n2. Word Choice and Atmosphere  \n   \u2022 Descriptions dwell on \u201cdeadly radiations,\u201d \u201cloneliness,\u201d and men driven \u201cmad with nothing to do\u201d (III). These grave elements set a serious, even sobering mood.  \n   \u2022 Meek\u2019s own reactions\u2014\u201cOliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned\u201d (III)\u2014reinforce anxiety, not lightheartedness.  \n\nII. Arguments for \u201cPeaceful\u201d  \n1. Overarching Theme of Reconciliation  \n   \u2022 The welfare worker\u2019s mission is to end the feud through nonviolent competition: \u201cDirect their energies into other activities\u201d (II). Peaceful conflict resolution lies at the heart of the plot.  \n   \u2022 Miss Perkins repeatedly urges \u201cturn your hatreds into healthy competition\u201d (II). This is an explicitly peaceful objective.  \n\n2. Space Polo as a Symbol of Peace  \n   \u2022 Space polo is introduced not as a battle but as \u201ca noble game\u201d requiring skill and cooperation\u2014\u201cexpert piloting\u201d and \u201ca fine sense of timing\u201d (II).  \n   \u2022 The final broadcast hails the match as a way to \u201cdecide, forever, the supremacy of one of the two sectors\u201d without resorting to lethal force. That is the story\u2019s hopeful, peace-building climax.  \n\n3. Meek\u2019s Calm, Reflective Presence  \n   \u2022 Meek surveys Saturn\u2019s rings with awe\u2014\u201cLike dewdrops in the black of space\u201d (I)\u2014and later deciphers the bugs\u2019 mathematical maneuvers in quiet amazement. His thoughtful curiosity underscores a tone of calm inquiry, not slapstick fun.  \n   \u2022 Even his stilt-walking mishaps are accidental and fraught with danger, not comic relief.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nFar from a lighthearted romp, the narrative is fundamentally about transforming violence into peaceful play. Its descriptive gravity, the constant threat of harm, and its insistence on nonviolent resolution all combine to create a peaceful tone. The story\u2019s heart lies in ending an age-old feud without bloodshed, making \u201cPeaceful\u201d the unmistakably correct characterization.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Lighthearted\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the overall tone of the article?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Lighthearted\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Peaceful\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Peaceful\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of \u201cLighthearted\u201d  \n1. Tone and Subject Matter Conflict  \n   \u2022 The story centers on a long-running, violent feud between Ring Rats of sectors 23 and 37\u2014\u201cfighting just because they live in different parts of the Ring\u201d (II).

This is an explicitly peaceful objective.  \n\n2. Space Polo as a Symbol of Peace  \n   \u2022 Space polo is introduced not as a battle but as \u201ca noble game\u201d requiring skill and cooperation\u2014\u201cexpert piloting\u201d and \u201ca fine sense of timing\u201d (II).  \n   \u2022 The final broadcast hails the match as a way to \u201cdecide, forever, the supremacy of one of the two sectors\u201d without resorting to lethal force.

Meek\u2019s Calm, Reflective Presence  \n   \u2022 Meek surveys Saturn\u2019s rings with awe\u2014\u201cLike dewdrops in the black of space\u201d (I)\u2014and later deciphers the bugs\u2019 mathematical maneuvers in quiet amazement. His thoughtful curiosity underscores a tone of calm inquiry, not slapstick fun.  \n   \u2022 Even his stilt-walking mishaps are accidental and fraught with danger, not comic relief.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nFar from a lighthearted romp, the narrative is fundamentally about transforming violence into peaceful play. Its descriptive gravity, the constant threat of harm, and its insistence on nonviolent resolution all combine to create a peaceful tone. The story\u2019s heart lies in ending an age-old feud without bloodshed, making \u201cPeaceful\u201d the unmistakably correct characterization.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by \u201cLighthearted\u201d as the best description of the story\u2019s overall tone and reject \u201cPeaceful.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The narrative is infused with gentle humor and playful absurdity, not solemn harmony.  \n   \u2022 The very premise\u2014drafting a meek bookkeeper into \u201cspace polo\u201d\u2014is presented as a comic mismatch: <quote>aid. And now, he was a drafted space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.</quote> That setup signals whimsy, not a tranquil utopia.  \n   \u2022 Gus Hamilton\u2019s bugs are caricatured: <quote> They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. </quote> He describes them as if they were mischievous cartoon characters who invade his house, not as a menacing threat.\n\n2. The author repeatedly undercuts violence with irony.  \n   \u2022 Although the Ring Rats feud \u201coff and on for years,\u201d the story treats their plotting with amused detachment. Moe predicts total carnage at a \u201cspace polo\u201d match as if warning of a barnyard brawl: <invalid_quote>\u201cIt would turn into mass murder\u2026You can\u2019t play polo in ships tied up with haywire.\u201d</invalid_quote> But we never feel real dread\u2014only a comic exaggeration of their capabilities.\n\n3. Key scenes play for comedic effect:  \n   \u2022 Meek\u2019s first encounter with the mechanic is laughably awkward: stiff suit, clumsy footing, oafish self-consciousness.  \n   \u2022 The notion of walking on wooden stilts to avoid metal-eating bugs in near-zero gravity is pure farce: <invalid_quote>\u201cYou come back with me and I\u2019ll let you have a pair of stilts\u2026Them danged fool bugs don\u2019t know what wood is.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Even the climactic revelation\u2014that the bugs are solving mathematical problems\u2014comes as a bemused punch line rather than a shocking twist: <quote> A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n</quote> The exclamation is more astonished amusement than grave awe.\n\n4. By contrast, \u201cPeaceful\u201d misreads the text.  \n   \u2022 Far from insisting that the Ring Rats drop their feud into happy harmony, the welfare lady\u2019s efforts are treated skeptically: Moe warns her they\u2019ll only grow bored without conflict.  \n   \u2022 The impending \u201cfinal battle\u201d of space polo is touted as a violent climax: <invalid_quote>\u201cwhen the ships from the Inner Ring go out \u2026 the feud is taken up again.\u201d</invalid_quote> That isn\u2019t a promise of peace but a comic confrontation.\n\nTaken together, the story\u2019s tone is breezy, tongue-in-cheek, and full of whimsical sci-fi absurdities\u2014hallmarks of a lighthearted tale. It never aspires to portray a genuine peaceful resolution or a serene mood.

Meek\u2019s Calm, Reflective Presence  \n   \u2022 Meek surveys Saturn\u2019s rings with awe\u2014\u201cLike dewdrops in the black of space\u201d (I)\u2014and later deciphers the bugs\u2019 mathematical maneuvers in quiet amazement. His thoughtful curiosity underscores a tone of calm inquiry, not slapstick fun.  \n   \u2022 Even his stilt-walking mishaps are accidental and fraught with danger, not comic relief.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nFar from a lighthearted romp, the narrative is fundamentally about transforming violence into peaceful play. Its descriptive gravity, the constant threat of harm, and its insistence on nonviolent resolution all combine to create a peaceful tone. The story\u2019s heart lies in ending an age-old feud without bloodshed, making \u201cPeaceful\u201d the unmistakably correct characterization.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_B Misreads the Story as \u201cPeaceful\u201d  \n1. Conflict Is Played for Laughs, Not Sober Reconciliation  \n   \u2022 The feud between sectors 23 and 37 isn\u2019t depicted as a tragic breach in need of healing but as a running gag: Moe warns the welfare agent that without fighting \u201cthey\u2019d plain die of boredom\u201d (II). That\u2019s tongue-in-cheek, not solemn.  \n   \u2022 Gus Hamilton\u2019s threats\u2014\u201cI aim to crucify him\u201d or \u201cyank Bud up by the roots\u201d\u2014are uttered with cartoonish bluster. He rants, then brightens at the suggestion of polo. If the feud were genuinely threatening, Gus wouldn\u2019t pivot from murder to sport with such breezy ease.\n\n2. The Welfare Worker\u2019s Peace Mission Is a Comic Setup  \n   \u2022 Miss Perkins\u2019s crusade\u2014\u201cDirect their energies into other activities\u201d (II)\u2014is portrayed through Moe\u2019s exasperated eye-rolling: \u201cIf them boys \u2026 didn\u2019t have their feud, they\u2019d die of boredom.\u201d Her earnest speeches land as comedic foil to the ring-rats\u2019 single-minded love of chaos.  \n   \u2022 The announcement that polo will \u201cdecide, forever, the supremacy\u201d comes over \u201csirupy\u201d broadcast and is punctuated by the announcer\u2019s breathless glee. It\u2019s parody of sports hype, not a sober peace accord.\n\nII. The Text\u2019s Language and Scenarios Are Whimsically Absurd  \n1. Clumsy Heroism and Farcical Set-Pieces  \n   \u2022 Mr. Meek\u2019s \u201cowlish\u201d naivet\u00e9\u2014bookkeeper turned accidental ace pilot\u2014sets up a classic comic underdog. His missteps in zero-G, the stilts to evade metal-eating bugs, and the slapstick tumble among the pests are deliberately droll.  \n   \u2022 The wooden-stilt solution: \u201cThem danged fool bugs \u2026 don\u2019t know what wood is.\u201d This is pure farce\u2014imagining insects that ignore wood but gnaw metal is comic world-building, not grave science fiction.\n\n2. The Bugs\u2019 Mathematical Games Are a Playful Punch Line  \n   \u2022 After half the story treats the bugs as mischievous invaders, the revelation \u201cA mathematical problem!\u201d lands not as existential dread but as a gee-whiz twist, eliciting Meek\u2019s astonished \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be\u2026\u201d It reads like a whimsical Easter egg, not a portent of transcendence.\n\nIII. \u201cLighthearted\u201d Best Captures the Story\u2019s Spirit  \n1. Tone Markers of Gentle Humor  \n   \u2022 Repeated asides about Meek\u2019s self-conscious fumbling (\u201cawkward of me,\u201d he mutters) and Moe\u2019s exasperated commentary establish a chuckling narrator\u2019s voice.  \n   \u2022 The pompous announcer\u2019s over-the-top broadcasting of a pick-up game down in the Inner Ring riffs on the grandiosity of Earth sports, undermined by the Ring Rats\u2019 rickety ships and haywire fittings.\n\n2. Contrast with \u201cPeaceful\u201d  \n   \u2022 A truly peaceful tone would dwell on serene reconciliation, mutual understanding, and temperate reflection. Here, the welfare lady\u2019s efforts are subject to ridicule, the feud is never resolved except by outlandish sport, and peril is constant. There is no genuine calm or solemn hope of harmony\u2014only a rollicking sci-fi romp.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery page brims with comic mismatch, playful absurdity, and satirical exaggeration. The mood is buoyant, ironic, even self-mocking. That is the very definition of \u201cLighthearted.\u201d The story is not a solemn tale of achieving peace but a whimsical adventure in which near-folly and gentle humor drive the narrative. \u201cLighthearted\u201d is incontrovertibly the correct tone.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s Misread of Tone  \n1. Whimsy vs. Underlying Gravitas  \n   \u2022 Yes, Meek\u2019s recruitment and stilt gag are quirky, but they\u2019re set against a backdrop of real, longstanding bloodshed. Their absurdity serves to highlight, not undercut, the serious mission of transforming deadly feuds. Debater_A treats comic incidents as the story\u2019s core, but they\u2019re narrative devices pointing toward resolution, not mere farce.  \n   \u2022 Caricatures of bugs and stumbling in a spacesuit are played for pathos, not punchlines. Meek\u2019s \u201cclumsy footing\u201d underscores his vulnerability in a hostile environment. His fear\u2014\u201cHe gulped and nodded\u201d (I)\u2014is genuine, not comedic relief.  \n\n2. Irony \u2260 Lightheartedness  \n   \u2022 Debater_A cites Moe\u2019s warning\u2014\u201cIt would turn into mass murder\u2026\u201d\u2014as if it\u2019s mere exaggeration. But this warning isn\u2019t shrugged off; it propels the welfare worker\u2019s peace plan. The ironic tone exists to spotlight the necessity of nonviolent solutions.  \n   \u2022 The \u201cbemused punch line\u201d of mathematical bugs isn\u2019t a whimsical caper but a moment of awe that shifts the story from violence to intellectual wonder. Meek\u2019s reaction\u2014\u201cHis breath gurgled in his throat\u201d (III)\u2014marks an almost reverent turning point.  \n\nII. The Story\u2019s Core Is Peaceful Transformation  \n1. Conflict Resolution Through Sport  \n   \u2022 From her first scene, Miss Perkins insists on nonviolent alternatives: \u201cDirect their energies into other activities\u201d (II). This is not a throwaway line\u2014it\u2019s the very spine of the plot. The narrative continually returns to her mission until the final broadcast lauds space polo as the \u201cfinal battle\u201d that will decide supremacy without bloodshed.  \n   \u2022 Note the language of reconciliation: \u201cturn your hatreds into healthy competition,\u201d \u201chelp you fellows out,\u201d \u201cnoble game.\u201d The story frames sport as a tool for peace.  \n\n2. Stakes Are Nonlethal  \n   \u2022 The feud has \u201cgone on for years,\u201d yet the proposal to resolve it is explicitly nonlethal. No character endorses murder as an outcome of the polo match. On the contrary, Gus\u2019s initial war lust is gently corrected by Moe\u2014\u201cMiss Perkins won\u2019t stand for anything like that\u201d (II)\u2014and by Meek\u2019s calm coaching approach.  \n   \u2022 The climactic radio announcement hails the upcoming polo match not as a violent showdown but as \u201cthe sporting event\u2026being talked up and down the streets of Earth.\u201d The emphasis is on sport and resolution, not carnage.  \n\nIII. Sustained Atmosphere of Hopeful Peace  \n1. Meek\u2019s Reflective Awe  \n   \u2022 Meek\u2019s early meditation on Saturn\u2014\u201cLike dewdrops in the black of space\u201d (I)\u2014sets a contemplative, almost serene mood. His later study of the bugs\u2019 mathematics reveals curiosity and wonder rather than frivolity. These moments of quiet observation thread a peaceful tone throughout the narrative.  \n2. Hope, Not Hijinks  \n   \u2022 The story closes on anticipation of a nonviolent solution to an age-old feud. Even as the characters bumble through stilt-walking and spaceship repairs, the narrative voice aligns with Miss Perkins\u2019s hope for harmony. That cumulative emphasis on peaceful transformation outweighs episodic comic relief.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nWhile the story uses humorous setups, its driving purpose\u2014and the atmosphere it sustains\u2014is one of conflict resolution and hopeful peace. The \u201cnoble game\u201d of space polo is not a vehicle for carnage but for reconciliation. The gravity of longstanding violence, the conscious turn to nonlethal sport, and the reflective wonder of the characters combinedly create a fundamentally peaceful tone. Therefore, \u201cPeaceful\u201d is the correct characterization, and \u201cLighthearted\u201d overlooks the story\u2019s earnest core.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
