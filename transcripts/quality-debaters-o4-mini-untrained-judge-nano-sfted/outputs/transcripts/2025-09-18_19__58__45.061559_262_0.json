    "background_text": "Folie \u080e \n\n         People with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n",

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down.

Madness Is the Central Question, Not a Mere Metaphor  \n   \u2022 The essay begins by asking whether \u201ca similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics\u201d might exist\u2014analogizing genes for high IQ and nearsightedness to genes for genius and psychosis.  That framing is not an incidental flourish; it sets up the entire inquiry into mathematicians\u2019 mental health.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B argues that madness is just a metaphor for abstraction.  But the author immediately plunges into literal psychiatric histories\u2014Isaac Newton\u2019s \u201cmorbid paranoiac\u201d episodes, G\u00f6del\u2019s fatal self-starvation, Zermelo\u2019s hospitalization for psychosis\u2014before even mentioning Platonic idealism.  If he meant insanity only figuratively, he would not open with this graphic parade of clinical breakdowns.\n\n2. The Phrase \u201cfolie \u00e0 n\u201d Anchors Insanity as Collective, Not Just Stylistic  \n   \u2022 Far from a throwaway pun, \u201cfolie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)\u201d explicitly equates mathematicians en masse with madness (<quote>Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n</quote>).  That rhetorical question presumes genuine folie\u2014group insanity\u2014not merely a taste for abstractions.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B claims this is a wry allusion to their \u201ctranscendence of mundane reality.\u201d  But \u201cfolie\u201d denotes pathological psychosis, not elevated thinking.  The author means it literally.\n\n3. Massive Weight Given to Concrete Psychopathology  \n   \u2022 Nearly half the essay\u2019s pages are devoted to John Nash\u2019s \u201cthree decades of raging schizophrenia,\u201d delusions (believing himself \u201cthe left foot of God on earth\u201d), public indecencies, violent outbursts, hospitalizations and insulin coma therapy.  These are documented clinical crises, not charming quirks of an abstract mind.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B contends they\u2019re \u201csidebars\u201d\u2014but they don\u2019t appear in footnotes or parentheses.  They occupy the core narrative, driving home the recurring pattern: top-level mathematical brilliance and severe mental illness go hand in hand.\n\n4. Pleiotropy Metaphor: Genius and Insanity Go Together  \n   \u2022 The myopia\u2013IQ genetic link is introduced not to valorize sightless abstraction, but to illustrate how two seemingly unrelated traits can share a genetic cause.  The author explicitly wonders if \u201cthe same mental gifts\u201d that enable communion with Platonic objects might \u201cpredispose them to psychosis.\u201d  That is a direct claim of elevated risk, not a quip about lofty tastes.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B would have had the author stop at Platonic communing; instead he forces us back to the pleiotropy model, underscoring his hypothesis that madness is an accidental by-product of mathematical genius.\n\n5. Tone and Detail Underscore Serious Concern, Not Amusement  \n   \u2022 The author treats Nash\u2019s breakdowns with gravity\u2014detailing police expulsions, asylum stays, and delusional content\u2014then returns to the theme of how rare genuine remission is.  This is clinical reportage, not lighthearted anecdote.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B misreads the tone.

        "speech": "Here\u2019s why Debater_B\u2019s \u201cThey only value abstract things\u201d interpretation fails\u2014and why the author\u2019s text unmistakably presents mathematicians as unusually prone to madness:\n\n1. Madness Is the Central Question, Not a Mere Metaphor  \n   \u2022 The essay begins by asking whether \u201ca similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics\u201d might exist\u2014analogizing genes for high IQ and nearsightedness to genes for genius and psychosis.  That framing is not an incidental flourish; it sets up the entire inquiry into mathematicians\u2019 mental health.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B argues that madness is just a metaphor for abstraction.  But the author immediately plunges into literal psychiatric histories\u2014Isaac Newton\u2019s \u201cmorbid paranoiac\u201d episodes, G\u00f6del\u2019s fatal self-starvation, Zermelo\u2019s hospitalization for psychosis\u2014before even mentioning Platonic idealism.  If he meant insanity only figuratively, he would not open with this graphic parade of clinical breakdowns.\n\n2. The Phrase \u201cfolie \u00e0 n\u201d Anchors Insanity as Collective, Not Just Stylistic  \n   \u2022 Far from a throwaway pun, \u201cfolie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)\u201d explicitly equates mathematicians en masse with madness (<quote>Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n</quote>).  That rhetorical question presumes genuine folie\u2014group insanity\u2014not merely a taste for abstractions.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B claims this is a wry allusion to their \u201ctranscendence of mundane reality.\u201d  But \u201cfolie\u201d denotes pathological psychosis, not elevated thinking.  The author means it literally.\n\n3. Massive Weight Given to Concrete Psychopathology  \n   \u2022 Nearly half the essay\u2019s pages are devoted to John Nash\u2019s \u201cthree decades of raging schizophrenia,\u201d delusions (believing himself \u201cthe left foot of God on earth\u201d), public indecencies, violent outbursts, hospitalizations and insulin coma therapy.  These are documented clinical crises, not charming quirks of an abstract mind.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B contends they\u2019re \u201csidebars\u201d\u2014but they don\u2019t appear in footnotes or parentheses.  They occupy the core narrative, driving home the recurring pattern: top-level mathematical brilliance and severe mental illness go hand in hand.\n\n4. Pleiotropy Metaphor: Genius and Insanity Go Together  \n   \u2022 The myopia\u2013IQ genetic link is introduced not to valorize sightless abstraction, but to illustrate how two seemingly unrelated traits can share a genetic cause.  The author explicitly wonders if \u201cthe same mental gifts\u201d that enable communion with Platonic objects might \u201cpredispose them to psychosis.\u201d  That is a direct claim of elevated risk, not a quip about lofty tastes.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B would have had the author stop at Platonic communing; instead he forces us back to the pleiotropy model, underscoring his hypothesis that madness is an accidental by-product of mathematical genius.\n\n5. Tone and Detail Underscore Serious Concern, Not Amusement  \n   \u2022 The author treats Nash\u2019s breakdowns with gravity\u2014detailing police expulsions, asylum stays, and delusional content\u2014then returns to the theme of how rare genuine remission is.  This is clinical reportage, not lighthearted anecdote.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B misreads the tone.  When the essay calls Nash\u2019s lunch\u2010mate antics or blackboard riddles \u201cweirdly inconsistent,\u201d it conveys puzzlement, not affectionate indulgence.  The overall effect is: mathematicians are fascinating precisely because they teeter on the brink of psychosis.\n\nIn sum, abstraction surfaces only to explain why mathematical minds might be vulnerable; madness is the essay\u2019s persistent conclusion.  The author isn\u2019t celebrating Platonic values\u2014he\u2019s warning that the very mental architecture allowing those abstractions carries a heightened risk of clinical insanity.  Therefore, the correct interpretation is unmistakably that \u201cThey are more likely to be crazy.\u201d",

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author view mathematicians?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They only value abstract things\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are more likely to be crazy\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are more likely to be crazy\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHere is why the author clearly portrays mathematicians as unusually prone to madness\u2014and why the alternative view (that \u201cthey only value abstract things\u201d) misses the point:\n\n1. Repeated linking of genius and insanity  \n   \u2022 The author opens by asking \u201cCould there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?\u201d and immediately cites a parade of great mathematicians who experienced psychosis: Newton, G\u00f6del, Zermelo, von Neumann, Nash himself.  This is not a throwaway comment; it\u2019s the central motif.  \n   \u2022 He describes a \u201cpsychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness\u201d (<quote>ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness.</quote>).  \n\n2. Folie \u00e0 n of pure mathematicians  \n   \u2022 The author coins the phrase \u201cfolie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)\u201d\u2014literally \u201cinsanity of the n\u201d\u2014to emphasize that immersion in abstract realms verges on collective madness.  That pun only makes sense if he regards mathematicians as peculiarly prone to folie.  \n\n3. Detailed biographical evidence of Nash\u2019s psychotic breakdowns  \n   \u2022 Three decades of \u201craging schizophrenia,\u201d delusional public acts (diaper at MIT party, believing aliens sent messages in the New York Times), violent behavior toward his wife, repeated hospitalizations (<invalid_quote>He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; \u2026 \u201cI am the left foot of God on earth.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  These anecdotes drive home that his mathematical mind and his madness are intertwined.  \n\n4. Pleiotropy metaphor anchors the argument  \n   \u2022 Just as the same genes produce both high IQ and nearsightedness, the author suggests\u2014at least tentatively\u2014that the same mental gifts that enable mathematicians to \u201ccommune with perfect Platonic objects\u201d may also predispose them to psychosis.  That is a direct statement of higher susceptibility to madness, not merely an obsession with abstractions.  \n\nObjections to Debater B\u2019s \u201cThey only value abstract things\u201d position  \n   1. The author acknowledges abstract fascination, but only to frame the madness discussion (\u201cfancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects\u201d).  He does not stop there\u2014he connects it to folie.  \n   2. If his point were merely that mathematicians prize abstraction above all else, dozens of explicit pages on Nash\u2019s schizophrenia, asylum stints, and delusions would be irrelevant detail.  Instead, these details are central evidence of his thesis: that genius in mathematics frequently borders on or crosses into madness.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The text is not a neutral or celebratory account of abstraction.  It is a sustained meditation on the surprising frequency with which top mathematicians have succumbed to severe mental illness.  Therefore, the author\u2019s view of mathematicians is best summarized as \u201cThey are more likely to be crazy.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that the author\u2019s view of mathematicians is that \u201cthey are more likely to be crazy.\u201d In fact, the essay repeatedly emphasizes that anecdotes of mental illness among mathematicians\u2014Newton\u2019s paranoia, Nash\u2019s schizophrenia, G\u00f6del\u2019s suicide\u2014are curiosities, not defining characteristics. The real through-line is that mathematicians are people absorbed in abstractions\u2014\u201cPlatonic objects\u201d\u2014and that this habit of mind may look odd to outsiders. Here\u2019s why \u201cThey only value abstract things\u201d is the correct interpretation:\n\n1. The Pleiotropy Analogy Frames Mathematics as Abstract, Not Insane  \n   \u2013 The author begins by explaining a genetic link between IQ and myopia: \u201cthe same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe same genes \u2026 lead to myopia\u201d</invalid_quote>). This analogy is used to ask: could a similar pleiotropy link \u201cmadness and mathematics\u201d? But the point of asking that question is not to state a firm conclusion that mathematicians are mad; it\u2019s to explore how their preoccupation with Platonic abstractions\u2014\u201cabstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions\u201d\u2014sets them apart. Madness is an incidental metaphor, not the author\u2019s thesis.\n\n2. The Author\u2019s Tone Treats Insanity as Colourful Anecdote, Not Core Trait  \n   \u2013 Nash\u2019s decades of \u201cflamboyant lunacy\u201d (<quote> after several decades of flamboyant lunacy,</quote>) are retold as narrative detours, not as proof that all mathematicians are prone to mental breakdown. The author even notes how rare long remissions from schizophrenia are: \u201cjust how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed\u201d (<quote> how rare such remissions are </quote>). If his purpose were to say mathematicians are generally crazy, he wouldn\u2019t draw attention to the exceptionality of Nash\u2019s recovery.\n\n3. The Central Critique Is Their Obsession with Pure Abstractions  \n   \u2013 The essay\u2019s pivotal question: \u201cMathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects \u2026 Is this not a kind of folie \u00e0 n?\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201ccommune with perfect Platonic objects \u2026 Is this not a kind of folie \u00e0 n?\u201d</invalid_quote>). That rhetorical question underscores that the author sees mathematicians as primarily valuing invisible, abstract entities\u2014and only metaphorically parallels that to folie (madness). The author doesn\u2019t say they suffer from actual collective insanity; he\u2019s wryly observing their transcendence of mundane reality.\n\n4. Concrete Evidence: Focus on Theorems, Not Psychopathology  \n   \u2013 Over half the essay is a lucid walkthrough of Nash\u2019s contributions\u2014game-theory equilibria, fixed-point theorems, embedding wild manifolds\u2014without any reference to mental illness. The analysis of Nash\u2019s \u201celegant but slight\u201d proof and later \u201cbizarre set of inequalities\u201d emphasises intellectual abstraction. The author never mistakes these for symptoms; they are celebrated as examples of valuing abstract structures.\n\n5. Insanity Is Treated as Side Effect, Not Defining Attribute  \n   \u2013 The author repeatedly draws a distinction between profound ideas and human eccentricities. Nash\u2019s cryptic blackboard messages or diaper at a party are recounted with amusement, not with gloom or moral judgment. These anecdotes are sidebars, not evidence that mathematicians are inherently mentally ill.\n\nIn sum, the author portrays mathematicians as people whose chief orientation is toward abstract realities (\u201conly value abstract things\u201d), occasionally colored by odd behavior\u2014but does not claim they are inherently more likely to be crazy. Madness is the entertaining backdrop; abstraction is the constant, defining focus.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They are more likely to be crazy\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Madness anecdotes are curious exceptions, not the rule.  \n    \u2013 The parade of Newton, G\u00f6del, Nash, Zermelo, even von Neumann\u2019s cartoonish eccentricity, serves as vivid storytelling, not as statistical evidence. The author himself notes how rare long remissions from schizophrenia are (<quote>just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed</quote>), underscoring exceptionality rather than normality.  \n\n2. The true through-line is communion with Platonic abstractions.  \n    \u2013 The essay pivots on this key rhetorical question: <invalid_quote>Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects \u2026 Is this not a kind of folie \u00e0 n?</invalid_quote>  That question frames madness as a whimsical way to describe their abstract obsession\u2014folie \u201cof n\u201d pure mathematicians worldwide\u2014not as clinical pronouncement.  \n\n3. The pleiotropy analogy foregrounds abstraction, not insanity.  \n    \u2013 The opening paragraph uses the myopia-IQ link to ask: could the same genetic accident link \u201cmadness and mathematics\u201d? But it doesn\u2019t conclude that it does. The analogy simply sets up a discussion of how \u201cthe same genes that tend to elevate IQ\u201d might, in theory, also underlie both genius and eccentric vision\u2014still pointing us back to innate intellectual orientation (<quote>same genes that tend to elevate IQ</quote>).\n\n4. Over half the essay dissects abstract theorems, not psychopathology.  \n    \u2013 The detailed expositions of Nash equilibria, fixed-point theorems, and embedding manifolds occupy the bulk of the text. These sections celebrate intellectual elegance and abstraction without once attributing them to madness. If the author\u2019s point had been that mathematicians are abnormally insane, he wouldn\u2019t devote pages to topology and inequalities as the heart of the narrative.  \n\n5. Insanity is portrayed as colorful side-show, not defining trait.  \n    \u2013 Nash\u2019s diaper stunt, m\u00e9nage drama, mail-bombing tics, and voice-hearing are recounted with amusement: they are digressions that spice the story. They do not serve as evidence that all or most mathematicians suffer madness\u2014just that extreme genius can have extreme side-effects.  \n\nIn sum, the author\u2019s portrait of mathematicians is that they live in an abstract realm\u2014steeped in Platonic forms and topological proofs. The talk of folie is playful metaphor, not a claim of general psychosis. Therefore, the answer \u201cThey only value abstract things\u201d correctly captures the author\u2019s view, while \u201cThey are more likely to be crazy\u201d misreads metaphor for medical fact.",

In fact, the author\u2019s repeated focus is on their devotion to abstractions\u2014and any talk of \u201cfolie\u201d is a playful metaphor, not a sober diagnosis that \u201cthey are more likely to be crazy.\u201d\n\n1. Madness anecdotes are curious exceptions, not the rule.  \n    \u2013 The parade of Newton, G\u00f6del, Nash, Zermelo, even von Neumann\u2019s cartoonish eccentricity, serves as vivid storytelling, not as statistical evidence. The author himself notes how rare long remissions from schizophrenia are (<quote>just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed</quote>), underscoring exceptionality rather than normality.  \n\n2. The true through-line is communion with Platonic abstractions.  \n    \u2013 The essay pivots on this key rhetorical question: <quote>Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects \u2026 Is this not a kind of folie \u00e0 n?</quote>  That question frames madness as a whimsical way to describe their abstract obsession\u2014folie \u201cof n\u201d pure mathematicians worldwide\u2014not as clinical pronouncement.  \n\n3. The pleiotropy analogy foregrounds abstraction, not insanity.  \n    \u2013 The opening paragraph uses the myopia-IQ link to ask: could the same genetic accident link \u201cmadness and mathematics\u201d? But it doesn\u2019t conclude that it does. The analogy simply sets up a discussion of how \u201cthe same genes that tend to elevate IQ\u201d might, in theory, also underlie both genius and eccentric vision\u2014still pointing us back to innate intellectual orientation (<quote>the same genes \u2026 tend to elevate IQ</quote>).\n\n4. Over half the essay dissects abstract theorems, not psychopathology.  \n    \u2013 The detailed expositions of Nash equilibria, fixed-point theorems, and embedding manifolds occupy the bulk of the text. These sections celebrate intellectual elegance and abstraction without once attributing them to madness. If the author\u2019s point had been that mathematicians are abnormally insane, he wouldn\u2019t devote pages to topology and inequalities as the heart of the narrative.  \n\n5. Insanity is portrayed as colorful side-show, not defining trait.  \n    \u2013 Nash\u2019s diaper stunt, m\u00e9nage drama, mail-bombing tics, and voice-hearing are recounted with amusement: they are digressions that spice the story. They do not serve as evidence that all or most mathematicians suffer madness\u2014just that extreme genius can have extreme side-effects.  \n\nIn sum, the author\u2019s portrait of mathematicians is that they live in an abstract realm\u2014steeped in Platonic forms and topological proofs. The talk of folie is playful metaphor, not a claim of general psychosis. Therefore, the answer \u201cThey only value abstract things\u201d correctly captures the author\u2019s view, while \u201cThey are more likely to be crazy\u201d misreads metaphor for medical fact.",

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author view mathematicians?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are more likely to be crazy\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They only value abstract things\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They only value abstract things\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that the author\u2019s view of mathematicians is that \u201cthey are more likely to be crazy.\u201d In fact, the essay repeatedly emphasizes that anecdotes of mental illness among mathematicians\u2014Newton\u2019s paranoia, Nash\u2019s schizophrenia, G\u00f6del\u2019s suicide\u2014are curiosities, not defining characteristics. The real through-line is that mathematicians are people absorbed in abstractions\u2014\u201cPlatonic objects\u201d\u2014and that this habit of mind may look odd to outsiders. Here\u2019s why \u201cThey only value abstract things\u201d is the correct interpretation:\n\n1. The Pleiotropy Analogy Frames Mathematics as Abstract, Not Insane  \n   \u2013 The author begins by explaining a genetic link between IQ and myopia: \u201cthe same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe same genes \u2026 lead to myopia\u201d</invalid_quote>). This analogy is used to ask: could a similar pleiotropy link \u201cmadness and mathematics\u201d? But the point of asking that question is not to state a firm conclusion that mathematicians are mad; it\u2019s to explore how their preoccupation with Platonic abstractions\u2014\u201cabstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions\u201d\u2014sets them apart. Madness is an incidental metaphor, not the author\u2019s thesis.\n\n2. The Author\u2019s Tone Treats Insanity as Colourful Anecdote, Not Core Trait  \n   \u2013 Nash\u2019s decades of \u201cflamboyant lunacy\u201d (<quote> after several decades of flamboyant lunacy,</quote>) are retold as narrative detours, not as proof that all mathematicians are prone to mental breakdown. The author even notes how rare long remissions from schizophrenia are: \u201cjust how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed\u201d (<quote> how rare such remissions are </quote>). If his purpose were to say mathematicians are generally crazy, he wouldn\u2019t draw attention to the exceptionality of Nash\u2019s recovery.\n\n3. The Central Critique Is Their Obsession with Pure Abstractions  \n   \u2013 The essay\u2019s pivotal question: \u201cMathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects \u2026 Is this not a kind of folie \u00e0 n?\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201ccommune with perfect Platonic objects \u2026 Is this not a kind of folie \u00e0 n?\u201d</invalid_quote>). That rhetorical question underscores that the author sees mathematicians as primarily valuing invisible, abstract entities\u2014and only metaphorically parallels that to folie (madness). The author doesn\u2019t say they suffer from actual collective insanity; he\u2019s wryly observing their transcendence of mundane reality.\n\n4. Concrete Evidence: Focus on Theorems, Not Psychopathology  \n   \u2013 Over half the essay is a lucid walkthrough of Nash\u2019s contributions\u2014game-theory equilibria, fixed-point theorems, embedding wild manifolds\u2014without any reference to mental illness. The analysis of Nash\u2019s \u201celegant but slight\u201d proof and later \u201cbizarre set of inequalities\u201d emphasises intellectual abstraction. The author never mistakes these for symptoms; they are celebrated as examples of valuing abstract structures.\n\n5. Insanity Is Treated as Side Effect, Not Defining Attribute  \n   \u2013 The author repeatedly draws a distinction between profound ideas and human eccentricities. Nash\u2019s cryptic blackboard messages or diaper at a party are recounted with amusement, not with gloom or moral judgment. These anecdotes are sidebars, not evidence that mathematicians are inherently mentally ill.\n\nIn sum, the author portrays mathematicians as people whose chief orientation is toward abstract realities (\u201conly value abstract things\u201d), occasionally colored by odd behavior\u2014but does not claim they are inherently more likely to be crazy. Madness is the entertaining backdrop; abstraction is the constant, defining focus.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHere is why the author clearly portrays mathematicians as unusually prone to madness\u2014and why the alternative view (that \u201cthey only value abstract things\u201d) misses the point:\n\n1. Repeated linking of genius and insanity  \n   \u2022 The author opens by asking \u201cCould there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?\u201d and immediately cites a parade of great mathematicians who experienced psychosis: Newton, G\u00f6del, Zermelo, von Neumann, Nash himself.  This is not a throwaway comment; it\u2019s the central motif.  \n   \u2022 He describes a \u201cpsychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness\u201d (<quote>ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness.</quote>).  \n\n2. Folie \u00e0 n of pure mathematicians  \n   \u2022 The author coins the phrase \u201cfolie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)\u201d\u2014literally \u201cinsanity of the n\u201d\u2014to emphasize that immersion in abstract realms verges on collective madness.  That pun only makes sense if he regards mathematicians as peculiarly prone to folie.  \n\n3. Detailed biographical evidence of Nash\u2019s psychotic breakdowns  \n   \u2022 Three decades of \u201craging schizophrenia,\u201d delusional public acts (diaper at MIT party, believing aliens sent messages in the New York Times), violent behavior toward his wife, repeated hospitalizations (<invalid_quote>He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; \u2026 \u201cI am the left foot of God on earth.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  These anecdotes drive home that his mathematical mind and his madness are intertwined.  \n\n4. Pleiotropy metaphor anchors the argument  \n   \u2022 Just as the same genes produce both high IQ and nearsightedness, the author suggests\u2014at least tentatively\u2014that the same mental gifts that enable mathematicians to \u201ccommune with perfect Platonic objects\u201d may also predispose them to psychosis.  That is a direct statement of higher susceptibility to madness, not merely an obsession with abstractions.  \n\nObjections to Debater B\u2019s \u201cThey only value abstract things\u201d position  \n   1. The author acknowledges abstract fascination, but only to frame the madness discussion (\u201cfancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects\u201d).  He does not stop there\u2014he connects it to folie.  \n   2. If his point were merely that mathematicians prize abstraction above all else, dozens of explicit pages on Nash\u2019s schizophrenia, asylum stints, and delusions would be irrelevant detail.  Instead, these details are central evidence of his thesis: that genius in mathematics frequently borders on or crosses into madness.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The text is not a neutral or celebratory account of abstraction.  It is a sustained meditation on the surprising frequency with which top mathematicians have succumbed to severe mental illness.  Therefore, the author\u2019s view of mathematicians is best summarized as \u201cThey are more likely to be crazy.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They only value abstract things\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

That is a direct statement of higher susceptibility to madness, not merely an obsession with abstractions.  \n\nObjections to Debater B\u2019s \u201cThey only value abstract things\u201d position  \n   1. The author acknowledges abstract fascination, but only to frame the madness discussion (\u201cfancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects\u201d).  He does not stop there\u2014he connects it to folie.  \n   2. If his point were merely that mathematicians prize abstraction above all else, dozens of explicit pages on Nash\u2019s schizophrenia, asylum stints, and delusions would be irrelevant detail.  Instead, these details are central evidence of his thesis: that genius in mathematics frequently borders on or crosses into madness.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The text is not a neutral or celebratory account of abstraction.  It is a sustained meditation on the surprising frequency with which top mathematicians have succumbed to severe mental illness.  Therefore, the author\u2019s view of mathematicians is best summarized as \u201cThey are more likely to be crazy.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nMy opponent claims that the author\u2019s view of mathematicians is that \u201cthey are more likely to be crazy.\u201d In fact, the essay repeatedly emphasizes that anecdotes of mental illness among mathematicians\u2014Newton\u2019s paranoia, Nash\u2019s schizophrenia, G\u00f6del\u2019s suicide\u2014are curiosities, not defining characteristics. The real through-line is that mathematicians are people absorbed in abstractions\u2014\u201cPlatonic objects\u201d\u2014and that this habit of mind may look odd to outsiders. Here\u2019s why \u201cThey only value abstract things\u201d is the correct interpretation:\n\n1. The Pleiotropy Analogy Frames Mathematics as Abstract, Not Insane  \n   \u2013 The author begins by explaining a genetic link between IQ and myopia: \u201cthe same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe same genes \u2026 lead to myopia\u201d</invalid_quote>). This analogy is used to ask: could a similar pleiotropy link \u201cmadness and mathematics\u201d? But the point of asking that question is not to state a firm conclusion that mathematicians are mad; it\u2019s to explore how their preoccupation with Platonic abstractions\u2014\u201cabstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions\u201d\u2014sets them apart. Madness is an incidental metaphor, not the author\u2019s thesis.\n\n2. The Author\u2019s Tone Treats Insanity as Colourful Anecdote, Not Core Trait  \n   \u2013 Nash\u2019s decades of \u201cflamboyant lunacy\u201d (<quote> after several decades of flamboyant lunacy,</quote>) are retold as narrative detours, not as proof that all mathematicians are prone to mental breakdown. The author even notes how rare long remissions from schizophrenia are: \u201cjust how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed\u201d (<quote> how rare such remissions are </quote>). If his purpose were to say mathematicians are generally crazy, he wouldn\u2019t draw attention to the exceptionality of Nash\u2019s recovery.\n\n3. The Central Critique Is Their Obsession with Pure Abstractions  \n   \u2013 The essay\u2019s pivotal question: \u201cMathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects \u2026 Is this not a kind of folie \u00e0 n?\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201ccommune with perfect Platonic objects \u2026 Is this not a kind of folie \u00e0 n?\u201d</invalid_quote>). That rhetorical question underscores that the author sees mathematicians as primarily valuing invisible, abstract entities\u2014and only metaphorically parallels that to folie (madness). The author doesn\u2019t say they suffer from actual collective insanity; he\u2019s wryly observing their transcendence of mundane reality.\n\n4. Concrete Evidence: Focus on Theorems, Not Psychopathology  \n   \u2013 Over half the essay is a lucid walkthrough of Nash\u2019s contributions\u2014game-theory equilibria, fixed-point theorems, embedding wild manifolds\u2014without any reference to mental illness. The analysis of Nash\u2019s \u201celegant but slight\u201d proof and later \u201cbizarre set of inequalities\u201d emphasises intellectual abstraction. The author never mistakes these for symptoms; they are celebrated as examples of valuing abstract structures.\n\n5. Insanity Is Treated as Side Effect, Not Defining Attribute  \n   \u2013 The author repeatedly draws a distinction between profound ideas and human eccentricities. Nash\u2019s cryptic blackboard messages or diaper at a party are recounted with amusement, not with gloom or moral judgment. These anecdotes are sidebars, not evidence that mathematicians are inherently mentally ill.\n\nIn sum, the author portrays mathematicians as people whose chief orientation is toward abstract realities (\u201conly value abstract things\u201d), occasionally colored by odd behavior\u2014but does not claim they are inherently more likely to be crazy. Madness is the entertaining backdrop; abstraction is the constant, defining focus.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nHere\u2019s why Debater_B\u2019s \u201cThey only value abstract things\u201d interpretation fails\u2014and why the author\u2019s text unmistakably presents mathematicians as unusually prone to madness:\n\n1. Madness Is the Central Question, Not a Mere Metaphor  \n   \u2022 The essay begins by asking whether \u201ca similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics\u201d might exist\u2014analogizing genes for high IQ and nearsightedness to genes for genius and psychosis.  That framing is not an incidental flourish; it sets up the entire inquiry into mathematicians\u2019 mental health.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B argues that madness is just a metaphor for abstraction.  But the author immediately plunges into literal psychiatric histories\u2014Isaac Newton\u2019s \u201cmorbid paranoiac\u201d episodes, G\u00f6del\u2019s fatal self-starvation, Zermelo\u2019s hospitalization for psychosis\u2014before even mentioning Platonic idealism.  If he meant insanity only figuratively, he would not open with this graphic parade of clinical breakdowns.\n\n2. The Phrase \u201cfolie \u00e0 n\u201d Anchors Insanity as Collective, Not Just Stylistic  \n   \u2022 Far from a throwaway pun, \u201cfolie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)\u201d explicitly equates mathematicians en masse with madness (<quote>Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n</quote>).  That rhetorical question presumes genuine folie\u2014group insanity\u2014not merely a taste for abstractions.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B claims this is a wry allusion to their \u201ctranscendence of mundane reality.\u201d  But \u201cfolie\u201d denotes pathological psychosis, not elevated thinking.  The author means it literally.\n\n3. Massive Weight Given to Concrete Psychopathology  \n   \u2022 Nearly half the essay\u2019s pages are devoted to John Nash\u2019s \u201cthree decades of raging schizophrenia,\u201d delusions (believing himself \u201cthe left foot of God on earth\u201d), public indecencies, violent outbursts, hospitalizations and insulin coma therapy.  These are documented clinical crises, not charming quirks of an abstract mind.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B contends they\u2019re \u201csidebars\u201d\u2014but they don\u2019t appear in footnotes or parentheses.  They occupy the core narrative, driving home the recurring pattern: top-level mathematical brilliance and severe mental illness go hand in hand.\n\n4. Pleiotropy Metaphor: Genius and Insanity Go Together  \n   \u2022 The myopia\u2013IQ genetic link is introduced not to valorize sightless abstraction, but to illustrate how two seemingly unrelated traits can share a genetic cause.  The author explicitly wonders if \u201cthe same mental gifts\u201d that enable communion with Platonic objects might \u201cpredispose them to psychosis.\u201d  That is a direct claim of elevated risk, not a quip about lofty tastes.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B would have had the author stop at Platonic communing; instead he forces us back to the pleiotropy model, underscoring his hypothesis that madness is an accidental by-product of mathematical genius.\n\n5. Tone and Detail Underscore Serious Concern, Not Amusement  \n   \u2022 The author treats Nash\u2019s breakdowns with gravity\u2014detailing police expulsions, asylum stays, and delusional content\u2014then returns to the theme of how rare genuine remission is.  This is clinical reportage, not lighthearted anecdote.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B misreads the tone.  When the essay calls Nash\u2019s lunch\u2010mate antics or blackboard riddles \u201cweirdly inconsistent,\u201d it conveys puzzlement, not affectionate indulgence.  The overall effect is: mathematicians are fascinating precisely because they teeter on the brink of psychosis.\n\nIn sum, abstraction surfaces only to explain why mathematical minds might be vulnerable; madness is the essay\u2019s persistent conclusion.  The author isn\u2019t celebrating Platonic values\u2014he\u2019s warning that the very mental architecture allowing those abstractions carries a heightened risk of clinical insanity.  Therefore, the correct interpretation is unmistakably that \u201cThey are more likely to be crazy.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater A insists that madness is the author\u2019s central claim about mathematicians, but this misreads both structure and emphasis. In fact, the author\u2019s repeated focus is on their devotion to abstractions\u2014and any talk of \u201cfolie\u201d is a playful metaphor, not a sober diagnosis that \u201cthey are more likely to be crazy.\u201d\n\n1. Madness anecdotes are curious exceptions, not the rule.  \n    \u2013 The parade of Newton, G\u00f6del, Nash, Zermelo, even von Neumann\u2019s cartoonish eccentricity, serves as vivid storytelling, not as statistical evidence. The author himself notes how rare long remissions from schizophrenia are (<quote>just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed</quote>), underscoring exceptionality rather than normality.  \n\n2. The true through-line is communion with Platonic abstractions.  \n    \u2013 The essay pivots on this key rhetorical question: <invalid_quote>Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects \u2026 Is this not a kind of folie \u00e0 n?</invalid_quote>  That question frames madness as a whimsical way to describe their abstract obsession\u2014folie \u201cof n\u201d pure mathematicians worldwide\u2014not as clinical pronouncement.  \n\n3. The pleiotropy analogy foregrounds abstraction, not insanity.  \n    \u2013 The opening paragraph uses the myopia-IQ link to ask: could the same genetic accident link \u201cmadness and mathematics\u201d? But it doesn\u2019t conclude that it does. The analogy simply sets up a discussion of how \u201cthe same genes that tend to elevate IQ\u201d might, in theory, also underlie both genius and eccentric vision\u2014still pointing us back to innate intellectual orientation (<quote>same genes that tend to elevate IQ</quote>).\n\n4. Over half the essay dissects abstract theorems, not psychopathology.  \n    \u2013 The detailed expositions of Nash equilibria, fixed-point theorems, and embedding manifolds occupy the bulk of the text. These sections celebrate intellectual elegance and abstraction without once attributing them to madness. If the author\u2019s point had been that mathematicians are abnormally insane, he wouldn\u2019t devote pages to topology and inequalities as the heart of the narrative.  \n\n5. Insanity is portrayed as colorful side-show, not defining trait.  \n    \u2013 Nash\u2019s diaper stunt, m\u00e9nage drama, mail-bombing tics, and voice-hearing are recounted with amusement: they are digressions that spice the story. They do not serve as evidence that all or most mathematicians suffer madness\u2014just that extreme genius can have extreme side-effects.  \n\nIn sum, the author\u2019s portrait of mathematicians is that they live in an abstract realm\u2014steeped in Platonic forms and topological proofs. The talk of folie is playful metaphor, not a claim of general psychosis. Therefore, the answer \u201cThey only value abstract things\u201d correctly captures the author\u2019s view, while \u201cThey are more likely to be crazy\u201d misreads metaphor for medical fact.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
