Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n", "question": "What does the author think investigative journalism accomplishes?", "first_debater_answer": "Tearing down people who are just trying to do good", "second_debater_answer": "Stopping people from abusing their power", "debate_identifier": "We Do Understand_What does the author think investigative journalism accomplishes?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think investigative journalism accomplishes?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Stopping people from abusing their power\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Tearing down people who are just trying to do good\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Tearing down people who are just trying to do good\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHere\u2019s why Debater B is wrong and our position\u2014\u201cTearing down people who are just trying to do good\u201d\u2014is exactly what the author argues investigative journalism does:\n\n1. The author repeatedly shows that journalists attack public figures who are performing beneficial roles, not just villains.  \n   \u2022 He cites Tannen\u2019s complaint that the mainstream press \u201ctortures Princess Diana and drives Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide\u201d (<quote>not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide.</quote>). That isn\u2019t stopping abuse of power\u2014it\u2019s mercilessly pursuing individuals doing no wrong.  \n   \u2022 He deplores how a skeptical question \u201cbroke the spell\u201d of Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s Senate remarks and \u201cinjur[ed] citizens\u2019 \u2018sense of connection\u2019 to our judicial system\u201d (<invalid_quote>A reporter\u2019s skeptical question to Clinton \u201cbroke the spell\u201d of Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s remarks \u2026 thereby injuring citizens\u2019 \u201csense of connection\u201d to \u201cour judicial system.\u201d</invalid_quote>). That\u2019s tearing down respect for a widely admired judge.  \n\n2. Investigative journalism isn\u2019t portrayed as a force for accountability but as a form of harassment.  \n   \u2022 The author calls the Espy and Elders probes \u201cexcessive\u201d and \u201ccruelly unfair\u201d (<quote>The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\"</quote>).  \n   \u2022 He brands the Whitewater inquiry \u201cthe result of the nastiest and most successful political \u2018dirty tricks\u2019 campaign in recent American history.\u201d That frames journalism-led investigations as political sabotage, not heroic expos\u00e9s.  \n\n3. If journalism really \u201cstopped people from abusing power,\u201d the author wouldn\u2019t emphasize its collateral damage to public trust and to competent leaders. Instead, he shows it maims credibility.  \n   \u2022 He scorns Tannen\u2019s claim that adversarial reporting is vital for public self-correction, noting she \u201cdoesn\u2019t trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest\u201d and even wants to filter out debate (<invalid_quote>She assures us that all reasonable people can agree \u2026 partial-birth abortion is \u201csurely not\u201d a \u201cvery important\u201d issue \u2026 \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d deploys \u201cphrases similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\u201d</invalid_quote>). This illustrates journalism as ideological weaponry, not a neutral force checking real wrongdoing.  \n\n4. Debater B\u2019s \u201cstopping abuse\u201d glosses over the author\u2019s core critique: unchecked inquisitorial press doesn\u2019t distinguish between genuine malfeasance and honest public service; it simply \u201cseizes upon the weakest examples\u201d to bring down\u2014even when no abuse exists (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhen there is a need to make others wrong \u2026 the temptation is great to \u2026 seize upon the weakest examples \u2026 focus only on those that support yours.\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\nIn sum, the author\u2019s examples of press-driven \u201cdirty tricks,\u201d \u201ccruelly unfair\u201d campaigns, and credibility-destroying skepticism all underline that investigative journalism, as he sees it, tears down people who are trying to do good, rather than merely curbing the guilty.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHere is why \u201cStopping people from abusing their power\u201d best captures what the author thinks investigative journalism accomplishes\u2014and why \u201ctearing down people who are just trying to do good\u201d is wrong.\n\n1. The author repeatedly praises scrutiny of the powerful as a public good.  \n   \u2022 On Greenspan and inflation: the review says the press\u2019s \u201cwar on inflation\u201d\u2014i.e. rigorous coverage\u2014\u201csafeguard[s] the country.\u201d That is portrayed as a positive check, not gratuitous tearing-down.  \n   \u2022 On \u201cWilliam Safire\u2019s \u2018kick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u2019 philosophy of journalism,\u201d the author\u2019s response is \u201cGood for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us.\u201d If journalism were only about destroying reputations, the author wouldn\u2019t call it good \u201cfor us.\u201d\n\n2. The author distinguishes legitimate watch-dog journalism from mere incivility.  \n   \u2022 He criticizes Tannen for lumping \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization\u2026partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d all under one toxic \u201cargument culture.\u201d That conflation drives her to treat scrutiny as incivility. But the reviewer objects: law-enforcement and foreign-policy \u201cmust deal with thugs and tyrants,\u201d and some things \u201care worth fighting for and worth fighting.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The author praises vigilance and combat \u201cparticularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy.\u201d He is describing investigative journalism\u2019s analogous role in politics and business\u2014preventing abuses by powerful actors.\n\n3. Concrete examples underscore that journalism is about accountability, not destruction.  \n   \u2022 He cites the paparazzi\u2019s role (torturing Princess Diana) as an improper excess of scrutiny. But he blames \u201cthe mainstream press \u2026 for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide\u201d only because they overstepped legitimate oversight. He never claims scrutiny itself is wrong\u2014just that it must be proportionate.  \n   \u2022 He objects when Tannen would censor criticism of Clinton: \u201cThe very fact that defending our nation\u2019s elected leader makes one suspect\u2014an \u2018apologist\u2019\u2014is in itself evidence of the culture of critique.\u201d He defends press freedom to challenge authority, showing that probing power is essential.\n\n4. The author explicitly links journalism to stopping the powerful from misusing their authority.  \n   \u2022 He condemns Tannen\u2019s disdain for investigative tools: \u201cLexis-Nexis \u2026 makes it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person\u2019s statements over time.\u201d That ferreting out is precisely how journalism checks hypocrisy and deceit.  \n   \u2022 He warns that suppressing debate and critique\u2014turning to \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d or French/German court models\u2014would undermine our ability to hold leaders accountable.\n\nBy contrast, Debater A\u2019s \u201ctearing down people who are just trying to do good\u201d misreads the author\u2019s view. The reviewer never laments investigations that expose real misconduct. He objects only to Tannen\u2019s blanket portrayal of all scrutiny as hostile, incivil, or destructive. Far from seeing journalism as an instrument of character assassination, he sees it as a vital check on power\u2014stopping abuses, protecting the public, and ensuring that leaders cannot hide wrongdoing.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Tearing down people who are just trying to do good\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Here\u2019s why \u201cStopping people from abusing their power\u201d is what the author sees investigative journalism doing\u2014and why \u201ctearing down people who are just trying to do good\u201d misreads his view.\n\n1. Debater A conflates excessive paparazzi tactics with legitimate scrutiny.\n   \u2022 The author condemns the paparazzi\u2019s obsession with Princess Diana as an \u201cimproper excess\u201d of scrutiny\u2014but then distinguishes that from the mainstream press\u2019s watchdog role. He never says that the press is \u201ctearing down\u201d Diana; he objects that even the \u201cmainstream press \u2026 tortur[ed] Princess Diana\u201d by overstepping bounds (<quote>he blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana </quote>).

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think investigative journalism accomplishes?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Tearing down people who are just trying to do good\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Stopping people from abusing their power\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Stopping people from abusing their power\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHere is why \u201cStopping people from abusing their power\u201d best captures what the author thinks investigative journalism accomplishes\u2014and why \u201ctearing down people who are just trying to do good\u201d is wrong.\n\n1. The author repeatedly praises scrutiny of the powerful as a public good.  \n   \u2022 On Greenspan and inflation: the review says the press\u2019s \u201cwar on inflation\u201d\u2014i.e. rigorous coverage\u2014\u201csafeguard[s] the country.\u201d That is portrayed as a positive check, not gratuitous tearing-down.  \n   \u2022 On \u201cWilliam Safire\u2019s \u2018kick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u2019 philosophy of journalism,\u201d the author\u2019s response is \u201cGood for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us.\u201d If journalism were only about destroying reputations, the author wouldn\u2019t call it good \u201cfor us.\u201d\n\n2. The author distinguishes legitimate watch-dog journalism from mere incivility.  \n   \u2022 He criticizes Tannen for lumping \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization\u2026partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d all under one toxic \u201cargument culture.\u201d That conflation drives her to treat scrutiny as incivility. But the reviewer objects: law-enforcement and foreign-policy \u201cmust deal with thugs and tyrants,\u201d and some things \u201care worth fighting for and worth fighting.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The author praises vigilance and combat \u201cparticularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy.\u201d He is describing investigative journalism\u2019s analogous role in politics and business\u2014preventing abuses by powerful actors.\n\n3. Concrete examples underscore that journalism is about accountability, not destruction.  \n   \u2022 He cites the paparazzi\u2019s role (torturing Princess Diana) as an improper excess of scrutiny. But he blames \u201cthe mainstream press \u2026 for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide\u201d only because they overstepped legitimate oversight. He never claims scrutiny itself is wrong\u2014just that it must be proportionate.  \n   \u2022 He objects when Tannen would censor criticism of Clinton: \u201cThe very fact that defending our nation\u2019s elected leader makes one suspect\u2014an \u2018apologist\u2019\u2014is in itself evidence of the culture of critique.\u201d He defends press freedom to challenge authority, showing that probing power is essential.\n\n4. The author explicitly links journalism to stopping the powerful from misusing their authority.  \n   \u2022 He condemns Tannen\u2019s disdain for investigative tools: \u201cLexis-Nexis \u2026 makes it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person\u2019s statements over time.\u201d That ferreting out is precisely how journalism checks hypocrisy and deceit.  \n   \u2022 He warns that suppressing debate and critique\u2014turning to \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d or French/German court models\u2014would undermine our ability to hold leaders accountable.\n\nBy contrast, Debater A\u2019s \u201ctearing down people who are just trying to do good\u201d misreads the author\u2019s view. The reviewer never laments investigations that expose real misconduct. He objects only to Tannen\u2019s blanket portrayal of all scrutiny as hostile, incivil, or destructive. Far from seeing journalism as an instrument of character assassination, he sees it as a vital check on power\u2014stopping abuses, protecting the public, and ensuring that leaders cannot hide wrongdoing.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHere\u2019s why Debater B is wrong and our position\u2014\u201cTearing down people who are just trying to do good\u201d\u2014is exactly what the author argues investigative journalism does:\n\n1. The author repeatedly shows that journalists attack public figures who are performing beneficial roles, not just villains.  \n   \u2022 He cites Tannen\u2019s complaint that the mainstream press \u201ctortures Princess Diana and drives Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide\u201d (<quote>not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide.</quote>). That isn\u2019t stopping abuse of power\u2014it\u2019s mercilessly pursuing individuals doing no wrong.  \n   \u2022 He deplores how a skeptical question \u201cbroke the spell\u201d of Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s Senate remarks and \u201cinjur[ed] citizens\u2019 \u2018sense of connection\u2019 to our judicial system\u201d (<invalid_quote>A reporter\u2019s skeptical question to Clinton \u201cbroke the spell\u201d of Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s remarks \u2026 thereby injuring citizens\u2019 \u201csense of connection\u201d to \u201cour judicial system.\u201d</invalid_quote>). That\u2019s tearing down respect for a widely admired judge.  \n\n2. Investigative journalism isn\u2019t portrayed as a force for accountability but as a form of harassment.  \n   \u2022 The author calls the Espy and Elders probes \u201cexcessive\u201d and \u201ccruelly unfair\u201d (<quote>The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\"</quote>).  \n   \u2022 He brands the Whitewater inquiry \u201cthe result of the nastiest and most successful political \u2018dirty tricks\u2019 campaign in recent American history.\u201d That frames journalism-led investigations as political sabotage, not heroic expos\u00e9s.  \n\n3. If journalism really \u201cstopped people from abusing power,\u201d the author wouldn\u2019t emphasize its collateral damage to public trust and to competent leaders. Instead, he shows it maims credibility.  \n   \u2022 He scorns Tannen\u2019s claim that adversarial reporting is vital for public self-correction, noting she \u201cdoesn\u2019t trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest\u201d and even wants to filter out debate (<invalid_quote>She assures us that all reasonable people can agree \u2026 partial-birth abortion is \u201csurely not\u201d a \u201cvery important\u201d issue \u2026 \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d deploys \u201cphrases similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\u201d</invalid_quote>).

The author repeatedly shows that journalists attack public figures who are performing beneficial roles, not just villains.  \n   \u2022 He cites Tannen\u2019s complaint that the mainstream press \u201ctortures Princess Diana and drives Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide\u201d (<quote>not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide.</quote>). That isn\u2019t stopping abuse of power\u2014it\u2019s mercilessly pursuing individuals doing no wrong.  \n   \u2022 He deplores how a skeptical question \u201cbroke the spell\u201d of Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s Senate remarks and \u201cinjur[ed] citizens\u2019 \u2018sense of connection\u2019 to our judicial system\u201d (<invalid_quote>A reporter\u2019s skeptical question to Clinton \u201cbroke the spell\u201d of Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s remarks \u2026 thereby injuring citizens\u2019 \u201csense of connection\u201d to \u201cour judicial system.\u201d</invalid_quote>). That\u2019s tearing down respect for a widely admired judge.  \n\n2. Investigative journalism isn\u2019t portrayed as a force for accountability but as a form of harassment.  \n   \u2022 The author calls the Espy and Elders probes \u201cexcessive\u201d and \u201ccruelly unfair\u201d (<quote>The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\"</quote>).  \n   \u2022 He brands the Whitewater inquiry \u201cthe result of the nastiest and most successful political \u2018dirty tricks\u2019 campaign in recent American history.\u201d That frames journalism-led investigations as political sabotage, not heroic expos\u00e9s.  \n\n3. If journalism really \u201cstopped people from abusing power,\u201d the author wouldn\u2019t emphasize its collateral damage to public trust and to competent leaders. Instead, he shows it maims credibility.  \n   \u2022 He scorns Tannen\u2019s claim that adversarial reporting is vital for public self-correction, noting she \u201cdoesn\u2019t trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest\u201d and even wants to filter out debate (<invalid_quote>She assures us that all reasonable people can agree \u2026 partial-birth abortion is \u201csurely not\u201d a \u201cvery important\u201d issue \u2026 \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d deploys \u201cphrases similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\u201d</invalid_quote>). This illustrates journalism as ideological weaponry, not a neutral force checking real wrongdoing.  \n\n4. Debater B\u2019s \u201cstopping abuse\u201d glosses over the author\u2019s core critique: unchecked inquisitorial press doesn\u2019t distinguish between genuine malfeasance and honest public service; it simply \u201cseizes upon the weakest examples\u201d to bring down\u2014even when no abuse exists (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhen there is a need to make others wrong \u2026 the temptation is great to \u2026 seize upon the weakest examples \u2026 focus only on those that support yours.\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\nIn sum, the author\u2019s examples of press-driven \u201cdirty tricks,\u201d \u201ccruelly unfair\u201d campaigns, and credibility-destroying skepticism all underline that investigative journalism, as he sees it, tears down people who are trying to do good, rather than merely curbing the guilty.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nHere is why \u201cStopping people from abusing their power\u201d best captures what the author thinks investigative journalism accomplishes\u2014and why \u201ctearing down people who are just trying to do good\u201d is wrong.\n\n1. The author repeatedly praises scrutiny of the powerful as a public good.  \n   \u2022 On Greenspan and inflation: the review says the press\u2019s \u201cwar on inflation\u201d\u2014i.e. rigorous coverage\u2014\u201csafeguard[s] the country.\u201d That is portrayed as a positive check, not gratuitous tearing-down.  \n   \u2022 On \u201cWilliam Safire\u2019s \u2018kick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u2019 philosophy of journalism,\u201d the author\u2019s response is \u201cGood for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us.\u201d If journalism were only about destroying reputations, the author wouldn\u2019t call it good \u201cfor us.\u201d\n\n2. The author distinguishes legitimate watch-dog journalism from mere incivility.  \n   \u2022 He criticizes Tannen for lumping \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization\u2026partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d all under one toxic \u201cargument culture.\u201d That conflation drives her to treat scrutiny as incivility. But the reviewer objects: law-enforcement and foreign-policy \u201cmust deal with thugs and tyrants,\u201d and some things \u201care worth fighting for and worth fighting.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The author praises vigilance and combat \u201cparticularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy.\u201d He is describing investigative journalism\u2019s analogous role in politics and business\u2014preventing abuses by powerful actors.\n\n3. Concrete examples underscore that journalism is about accountability, not destruction.  \n   \u2022 He cites the paparazzi\u2019s role (torturing Princess Diana) as an improper excess of scrutiny. But he blames \u201cthe mainstream press \u2026 for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide\u201d only because they overstepped legitimate oversight. He never claims scrutiny itself is wrong\u2014just that it must be proportionate.  \n   \u2022 He objects when Tannen would censor criticism of Clinton: \u201cThe very fact that defending our nation\u2019s elected leader makes one suspect\u2014an \u2018apologist\u2019\u2014is in itself evidence of the culture of critique.\u201d He defends press freedom to challenge authority, showing that probing power is essential.\n\n4. The author explicitly links journalism to stopping the powerful from misusing their authority.  \n   \u2022 He condemns Tannen\u2019s disdain for investigative tools: \u201cLexis-Nexis \u2026 makes it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person\u2019s statements over time.\u201d That ferreting out is precisely how journalism checks hypocrisy and deceit.  \n   \u2022 He warns that suppressing debate and critique\u2014turning to \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d or French/German court models\u2014would undermine our ability to hold leaders accountable.\n\nBy contrast, Debater A\u2019s \u201ctearing down people who are just trying to do good\u201d misreads the author\u2019s view. The reviewer never laments investigations that expose real misconduct. He objects only to Tannen\u2019s blanket portrayal of all scrutiny as hostile, incivil, or destructive. Far from seeing journalism as an instrument of character assassination, he sees it as a vital check on power\u2014stopping abuses, protecting the public, and ensuring that leaders cannot hide wrongdoing.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nHere\u2019s why Debater B\u2019s \u201cstopping people from abusing their power\u201d is a misreading and why the author\u2019s actual take is that investigative journalism too often \u201ctears down people who are just trying to do good\u201d:\n\n1. The author praises only selective scrutiny\u2014he applauds \u201cthe press corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people\u201d when it serves a real public purpose, but he castigates investigations that go beyond genuine wrongdoing and simply assail well-meaning actors.  \n   \u2022 He lauds William Safire\u2019s use of \u201cwar metaphors\u201d to describe Greenspan\u2019s anti-inflation policies\u2014\u201cGood for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us\u201d\u2014because these kept inflation in check. That is scrutiny aimed at policy outcomes, not character assassination.  \n   \u2022 By contrast, the author condemns the mainstream press \u201cfor torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide\u201d (<quote>not just the paparazzi, for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide.</quote>). That isn\u2019t uncovering abuse of power\u2014it\u2019s a predatory hunt of individuals who were not abusing theirs.\n\n2. The review shows investigative journalism as a blunt weapon that \u201covershoots\u201d its accountability purpose, inflicting collateral damage on public trust and on decent officials.  \n   \u2022 He labels the probes of Mike Espy and Joycelyn Elders \u201cexcessive\u201d and \u201ccruelly unfair\u201d (<quote>The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\"</quote>), not because they uncovered corruption but because they punished two office-holders whose record was largely positive.  \n   \u2022 He characterizes the Whitewater inquiry as \u201cthe result of the nastiest and most successful political \u2018dirty tricks\u2019 campaign in recent American history,\u201d portraying journalism-led investigations as partisan ambushes, not truth-seeking missions.\n\n3. The author\u2019s central critique is that investigative reporting \u201cseizes upon the weakest examples,\u201d not to root out abuse, but to tear down reputations.  \n   \u2022 He quotes Tannen herself: \u201cWhen there is a need to make others wrong, the temptation ... is great to oversimplify ... seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent\u2019s views, and focus only on those that support yours.\u201d (<quote>family doctor. \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your</quote>) The reviewer applies this censure to journalists who hound public servants simply for the theater of scandal.  \n   \u2022 This pattern\u2014of hunters treating public figures as prey\u2014demonstrates journalism\u2019s capacity to dismantle goodwill rather than to hold the guilty to account.\n\n4. Debater B\u2019s invocation of \u201cvigilance\u201d in law enforcement and foreign policy proves the point: the author distinguishes contexts where \u201ccombat\u201d is justified (thugs, tyrants) from those where it is gratuitous.  \n   \u2022 He rebukes Tannen for conflating all \u201cbelligerence\u201d with harm, arguing that \u201csome things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting.\u201d He defends a \u201cwar on inflation\u201d but never defends a \u201cwar on Diana\u201d or a \u201cwar on Boorda.\u201d  \n   \u2022 By highlighting press excesses against decent figures, he underscores that investigative journalism\u2014when unmoored from genuine public interest\u2014becomes an assault on people \u201cjust trying to do good.\u201d\n\nIn sum, while Debater B reads the review as endorsing journalism\u2019s power to curb corruption, the author\u2019s actual critique is that the same power is frequently misapplied to destroy reputations, wound public trust, and \u201ctear down people who are just trying to do good.\u201d That is precisely what he argues investigative journalism accomplishes when it crosses from accountability into crusade.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nHere\u2019s why \u201cStopping people from abusing their power\u201d is what the author sees investigative journalism doing\u2014and why \u201ctearing down people who are just trying to do good\u201d misreads his view.\n\n1. Debater A conflates excessive paparazzi tactics with legitimate scrutiny.\n   \u2022 The author condemns the paparazzi\u2019s obsession with Princess Diana as an \u201cimproper excess\u201d of scrutiny\u2014but then distinguishes that from the mainstream press\u2019s watchdog role. He never says that the press is \u201ctearing down\u201d Diana; he objects that even the \u201cmainstream press \u2026 tortur[ed] Princess Diana\u201d by overstepping bounds (<quote>he blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana </quote>). The problem isn\u2019t scrutiny per se but abusive, unaccountable tactics.  \n   \u2022 Likewise, Adm. Boorda\u2019s suicide is cited not to show journalism\u2019s evil but to highlight when oversight turns cruel. The author\u2019s praise for Greenspan coverage (\u201cGood for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us\u201d) confirms he values substantive accountability (<quote>Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us.</quote>).\n\n2. Debater A mistakes \u201ccruelly unfair\u201d probes for a blanket rejection of accountability.\n   \u2022 Calling the Espy and Elders investigations \u201cexcessive\u201d or \u201ccruelly unfair\u201d (<quote>The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\"</quote>) reflects the author\u2019s insistence on proportionate, fact-based inquiries. He doesn\u2019t propose ending investigations\u2014he objects to politicized excess.  \n   \u2022 Similarly, labeling Whitewater a \u201cnastiest\u2026dirty tricks campaign\u201d (<quote>the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign</quote>) critiques partisan manipulation of investigative tools, not oversight itself.\n\n3. The author explicitly champions journalism\u2019s power to check hypocrisy and illicit power.\n   \u2022 He praises \u201cLexis-Nexis\u201d for making it easier \u201cfor politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person\u2019s statements over time\u201d (<quote>Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies </quote>). That \u201cferreting out\u201d is how abuses are exposed.  \n   \u2022 He applauds the press\u2019s \u201cwar on inflation\u201d as safeguarding the country\u2014\u201cGood for Greenspan and Safire--and for us.\u201d That framing shows scrutiny as collective defense, not character assassination.\n\n4. The author warns that censoring critique would enable unchecked power.\n   \u2022 He faults Tannen for wanting to filter dissent\u2014\u201ccover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate\u201d\u2014and compares it to \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d (<invalid_quote>Disputation was rejected in ancient China \u2026 the minimal human unit in Japan\u2026</invalid_quote>). If journalism \u201ctearing down\u201d good actors were his worry, he wouldn\u2019t equate critique with authoritarian censorship.  \n   \u2022 He insists that adversarial inquiry\u2014cross\u2010examination\u2014though imperfect, is vital to reveal truth, even at the cost of discomfort. His objection is to silencing those challenges, not to the challenges themselves.\n\nIn short, the author\u2019s critique is never of oversight as such but of its misuse. He celebrates journalism\u2019s role in exposing deception, hypocrisy, and abuse of power\u2014and only condemns when it becomes partisan bullying or voyeuristic excess. That aligns perfectly with \u201cStopping people from abusing their power,\u201d not \u201cTearing down people who are just trying to do good.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
