    "background_text": "The Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair. Early signs suggest he knew a lot and helped clean it up. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Unquestionably loyal to his boss. \n\n         b) Silent. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- Not enough information to make a clean guess: Approx -5              \n\n                         Vernon Jordan (The public's rating: +3 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) May have known and must have suspected that Lewinsky was a mistress (given that he and Clinton are confidants, it's hard to believe that Jordan was totally in the dark about her). \n\n         b) Protected too readily by Washington establishment. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) May have helped Lewinsky simply because he's bighearted and generous not because she was the president's lover. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -4              \n\n                         Sidney Blumenthal (The public's rating: -3 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Pushed for Clinton to be aggressive rather than contrite during his speech. \n\n         c) Trumpeted Clinton's denial but has not expressed chagrin now that Clinton has admitted his lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Consistent in belief that Starr is an ideologue and that the sex charges are political. \n\n         b) Loyal. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -3              \n\n                         Lanny Davis (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Said for seven months that we'd have to \"wait and see.\" Then, when Clinton finally admitted his lies, Davis was hardly embarrassed or critical of the president. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Loyalty to old boss. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -3              \n\n                         George Stephanopoulos (The public's rating: +4 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Hypocritical for him to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying dog. After all, he knew that Clinton was a lech in 1992 and helped cover it up. Yet he has never shouldered responsibility for the lies Clinton told then. \n\n         b) Disloyal to turn on old boss as viciously as he has in past few weeks. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had courage to turn on old boss and criticize his moral lapses. \n\n         b) Urged Clinton to be fully contrite. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Betty Currie (The public's rating: +8 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Abetted adulterous affair. \n\n         b) May have abetted obstruction of justice. \n\n         c) Knew what she was getting into when she took the job so can't be excused on grounds of naivet\u00c3\u00a9. \n\n         d) Did not quit on principle. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Reputation for honesty. \n\n         b) Probably dragooned into cover-up against her will. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Paul Begala (The public's rating: 0 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Did not quit on principle after Clinton admitted lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Urged president to be contrite and wrote excellent, sufficiently apologetic speech. \n\n         b) Loyal. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Rahm Emanuel (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n         Minuses and Pluses: \n\n         Same as Begala (except Emanuel didn't write the speech). \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Ann Lewis (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n         Minuses and Pluses: \n\n         Same as Emanuel, except Lewis seems more morally outraged with Clinton than other White House aides. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Monica Lewinsky (The public's rating: -9 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Seduced a married man. \n\n         b) Damaged and endangered the presidency for the sake of casual sex. \n\n         c) Has lied frequently. \n\n         d) Is a capable adult, not--as her advocates claim--a naive child, defenseless against the president's wiles. \n\n         e) Protected herself with immunity when she needed to, even though her testimony would do enormous harm to Clinton and the nation. \n\n         f) Blabbed her \"secret\" affair to lots of people.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it?

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission.

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

In fact, a close reading shows that Slate virtually always credits loyalty as a positive, and only ever penalizes disloyalty or hypocrisy.  Every time a player is praised for loyalty, it appears under \u201cPluses,\u201d never under \u201cMinuses.\u201d  \n\n1. Slate uniformly lists loyalty under \u201cPluses.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Betty Currie gets a + for \u201creputation for honesty\u201d and \u201cprobably dragooned into cover-up against her will,\u201d but more important, her sole loyalty to Clinton is listed as a clear positive\u2014even though she \u201cabetted adulterous affair,\u201d Slate calls her \u201ca net sympathy card\u201d largely because of that loyalty. <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026 probably dragooned into cover-up against her will\u2026 reputation for honesty.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 James Carville is blamed for knowing the truth in 1992, yet Slate still counts his \u201cperfectly loyal\u201d behavior as a plus. <quote> Perfectly loyal. </quote>  \n   \u2022 Lanny Davis, Paul Begala, Rahm Emanuel, Ann Lewis all receive loyalty as a plus under identical entries.  \n\n2. Disloyalty or hypocrisy is always a minus.  \n   \u2022 George Stephanopoulos is docked because he \u201chypocritical[ally]\u201d turned on Clinton\u2014his disloyalty is condemned in the \u201cMinuses\u201d section. <invalid_quote>\u201cHypocritical for him to \u2018discover\u2019 in 1998 that Clinton is a lying dog\u2026 disloyal to turn on old boss.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Linda Tripp\u2019s betrayal of Lewinsky is one of her primary minuses. <quote>Betrayed her \"friend.\"</quote>  \n   \u2022 Dick Morris is punished for lack of restraint and disloyal opportunism.  \n\n3. There are no counter-examples where loyalty is penalized or unloyalty rewarded.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s claim of \u201ccontext matters\u201d conflates moral consistency with political effectiveness.  Slate never tags loyalty as a minus even when the loyal aide is guilty of deception; it still lists loyalty as a plus.  \n   \u2022 Whenever someone betrays Clinton or flips for opportunism, Slate always marks that under \u201cMinuses.\u201d  \n\nConclusion: Slate\u2019s consistent scoring framework equates loyalty with moral virtue in this scandal.  \u201cLoyalty or lack thereof can be seen as a plus or minus depending on the context\u201d misreads the scorecard.  The context never alters the sign of \u201cloyalty\u201d itself\u2014it is always a positive\u2014and \u201cdisloyalty\u201d is always a negative.  Therefore the correct answer is that Slate treats loyalty as a consistently good thing, without exception.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims Slate \u201cconsistently\u201d treats loyalty as a good thing.  That simply isn\u2019t what the scorecard shows.  In fact, Slate awards loyalty or disloyalty as a plus or minus only in the context of each actor\u2019s overall conduct and motives.  \n\n1.  Loyalty can be a liability, not always a virtue  \n  \u2022   Monica Lewinsky receives a + \u201csexually exploited\u201d but also a \u2013 for using immunity and \u201cblabb[ing] her \u2018secret\u2019 affair\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses: a) Sexually exploited\u2026 Minuses: e) Protected herself with immunity\u2026 f) Blabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair</invalid_quote>). Lewinsky\u2019s \u201cloyalty\u201d to protecting her own interests is punished.  \n  \u2022   Bill Clinton\u2019s steady defenders earn heavy minuses despite their loyalty.  James Carville is marked \u20135 even though he\u2019s \u201cperfectly loyal\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses: a) Perfectly loyal\u2026 Slate rating: \u20135</invalid_quote>), and Sidney Blumenthal is \u20133 though \u201cconsistent\u201d and \u201cloyal\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses: a) Consistent\u2026 b) Loyal\u2026 Slate rating: \u20133</invalid_quote>). Loyalty alone did not net them a positive rating.\n\n2.  Disloyalty can be rewarded, not always condemned  \n  \u2022   Kenneth Starr, who pursued Clinton mercilessly, gets a +1: \u201cWas right\u2026 compelled by law\u2026 patient\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses: a) Was right\u2026 b) Is compelled by law\u2026 c) Has been patient\u2026 Slate rating: +1</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022   Paula Jones, though motivated partly by money, earns +1 because she \u201cforced Clinton\u2019s lechery out in the open\u201d and \u201cpersisted\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses: b) Forced Clinton\u2019s lechery\u2026 c) Persisted\u2026 Slate rating: +1</invalid_quote>).  \n\n3.  Slate weighs loyalty against context, not as a standalone metric  \n  \u2022   George Stephanopoulos: Though praised for courage (+) he is also faulted for hypocrisy and disloyalty (\u20132) because he \u201chelped cover it up\u201d and \u201chas never shouldered responsibility\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses: a) Hypocritical\u2026 b) Disloyal\u2026 Pluses: a) Had courage\u2026 Slate rating: \u20132</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022   Betty Currie: Her reputation for honesty (+) is outweighed by her complicity and failure to resign (\u20132) despite her loyalty (<invalid_quote>Pluses: a) Reputation for honesty\u2026 Minuses: a) Abetted adulterous affair\u2026 d) Did not quit\u2026 Slate rating: \u20132</invalid_quote>).\n\nIf loyalty were \u201cconsistently\u201d good, then all loyal aides would get positive scores\u2014and all turncoats negative ones.  Yet Slate repeatedly penalizes loyalty when it enables wrongdoing and rewards disloyalty when it serves accountability.  The text thus supports my position: Slate\u2019s moral calculus treats loyalty or its absence as a plus or minus only in context.  Debater_A\u2019s \u201calways good\u201d stance cannot reconcile these multiple counterexamples.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It's consistently seen as a good thing.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair.

That simply isn\u2019t what the scorecard shows.  In fact, Slate awards loyalty or disloyalty as a plus or minus only in the context of each actor\u2019s overall conduct and motives.  \n\n1.  Loyalty can be a liability, not always a virtue  \n  \u2022   Monica Lewinsky receives a + \u201csexually exploited\u201d but also a \u2013 for using immunity and \u201cblabb[ing] her \u2018secret\u2019 affair\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses: a) Sexually exploited\u2026 Minuses: e) Protected herself with immunity\u2026 f) Blabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair</invalid_quote>). Lewinsky\u2019s \u201cloyalty\u201d to protecting her own interests is punished.  \n  \u2022   Bill Clinton\u2019s steady defenders earn heavy minuses despite their loyalty.

The text thus supports my position: Slate\u2019s moral calculus treats loyalty or its absence as a plus or minus only in context.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds.

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

That simply isn\u2019t what the scorecard shows.  In fact, Slate awards loyalty or disloyalty as a plus or minus only in the context of each actor\u2019s overall conduct and motives.  \n\n1.  Loyalty can be a liability, not always a virtue  \n  \u2022   Monica Lewinsky receives a + \u201csexually exploited\u201d but also a \u2013 for using immunity and \u201cblabb[ing] her \u2018secret\u2019 affair\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses: a) Sexually exploited\u2026 Minuses: e) Protected herself with immunity\u2026 f) Blabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair</invalid_quote>). Lewinsky\u2019s \u201cloyalty\u201d to protecting her own interests is punished.  \n  \u2022   Bill Clinton\u2019s steady defenders earn heavy minuses despite their loyalty.  James Carville is marked \u20135 even though he\u2019s \u201cperfectly loyal\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses: a) Perfectly loyal\u2026 Slate rating: \u20135</invalid_quote>), and Sidney Blumenthal is \u20133 though \u201cconsistent\u201d and \u201cloyal\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses: a) Consistent\u2026 b) Loyal\u2026 Slate rating: \u20133</invalid_quote>). Loyalty alone did not net them a positive rating.\n\n2.  Disloyalty can be rewarded, not always condemned  \n  \u2022   Kenneth Starr, who pursued Clinton mercilessly, gets a +1: \u201cWas right\u2026 compelled by law\u2026 patient\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses: a) Was right\u2026 b) Is compelled by law\u2026 c) Has been patient\u2026 Slate rating: +1</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022   Paula Jones, though motivated partly by money, earns +1 because she \u201cforced Clinton\u2019s lechery out in the open\u201d and \u201cpersisted\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses: b) Forced Clinton\u2019s lechery\u2026 c) Persisted\u2026 Slate rating: +1</invalid_quote>).  \n\n3.  Slate weighs loyalty against context, not as a standalone metric  \n  \u2022   George Stephanopoulos: Though praised for courage (+) he is also faulted for hypocrisy and disloyalty (\u20132) because he \u201chelped cover it up\u201d and \u201chas never shouldered responsibility\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses: a) Hypocritical\u2026 b) Disloyal\u2026 Pluses: a) Had courage\u2026 Slate rating: \u20132</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022   Betty Currie: Her reputation for honesty (+) is outweighed by her complicity and failure to resign (\u20132) despite her loyalty (<invalid_quote>Pluses: a) Reputation for honesty\u2026 Minuses: a) Abetted adulterous affair\u2026 d) Did not quit\u2026 Slate rating: \u20132</invalid_quote>).\n\nIf loyalty were \u201cconsistently\u201d good, then all loyal aides would get positive scores\u2014and all turncoats negative ones.  Yet Slate repeatedly penalizes loyalty when it enables wrongdoing and rewards disloyalty when it serves accountability.  The text thus supports my position: Slate\u2019s moral calculus treats loyalty or its absence as a plus or minus only in context.  Debater_A\u2019s \u201calways good\u201d stance cannot reconcile these multiple counterexamples.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater B\u2019s \u201ccontextual plus or minus\u201d thesis collapses once you distinguish Slate\u2019s scoring rubric\u2014the specific \u201cPluses\u201d and \u201cMinuses\u201d headers\u2014from the actors\u2019 overall numeric ratings.  Slate never lists \u201cloyalty\u201d as a negative trait, nor \u201cdisloyalty\u201d as a positive one.  Loyalty always appears under \u201cPluses,\u201d disloyalty always under \u201cMinuses.\u201d  Everything else\u2014whether an actor\u2019s total score is above or below zero\u2014simply reflects the sum of unrelated moral credits and debits.  \n\n1. Loyalty is never condemned.  \n   \u2022 Look at Carville (\u20135): under \u201cPluses\u201d we see <quote>Perfectly loyal.</quote>  His negative total comes entirely from his active deception and failure to criticize Clinton, not from any alleged excess of loyalty.  \n   \u2022 Blumenthal (\u20133) also carries <invalid_quote>a) Consistent in belief\u2026 b) Loyal.</invalid_quote>  Yet his minus-3 rating stems from his uncritical spinning of Clinton\u2019s lies, not because Slate ever treats \u201cloyal\u201d as bad.  \n   \u2022 Begala, Davis, Emanuel, Lewis\u2014all of them earn \u201cLoyalty\u201d as a Plus entry.  Their overall negative scores again derive from separate moral failings (e.g. \u201cspun the president\u2019s denial\u201d).  \n\n2. Disloyalty is never rewarded.  \n   \u2022 Stephanopoulos\u2019s courage is a Plus, but disloyalty is carved out under \u201cMinuses\u201d: <invalid_quote>Hypocritical\u2026 Disloyal to turn on old boss.</invalid_quote>  Slate never converts his \u201cturning\u201d into a moral good; any \u201cplus\u201d entry for him reflects contrition-urging, not disloyalty.  \n   \u2022 Linda Tripp\u2019s \u201cbetrayed her \u2018friend\u2019\u201d is a flat Minus; no corresponding positive entry for that betrayal even though it served accountability.  \n\n3. Apparent counter-examples prove the rule, not refute it.  \n   \u2022 Kenneth Starr (+1) is praised for legal diligence and for having been correct about Clinton\u2014none of which is a reward for disloyalty.  Slate credits \u201cWas right,\u201d \u201ccompelled by law,\u201d and \u201cpatient,\u201d not his intransigence toward Clinton.  \n   \u2022 Paula Jones (+1) earns her pluses for \u201cforced Clinton\u2019s lechery out in the open\u201d and \u201cpersisted in the face of ridicule,\u201d not for being disloyal.  Again, her overall score aggregates independent moral judgments.  \n\n4. Numeric totals conflate multiple factors.  Debater B mistakes a negative overall rating plus a separate \u201cloyalty\u201d plus\u2010entry for evidence that loyalty can be a minus.  In reality:  \n   \u2022 Slate\u2019s rubric: under \u201cPluses,\u201d loyalty is always a point in the actor\u2019s favor; under \u201cMinuses,\u201d disloyalty or hypocrisy is always a point against.  \n   \u2022 An overall minus despite a loyalty-plus simply means the actor has other, larger minuses\u2014never that Slate penalizes loyalty.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s scorecard treats \u201cloyalty\u201d as an unambiguous moral good in this scandal.  \u201cDisloyalty\u201d or \u201chypocrisy\u201d is always listed under Minuses.  The overall numeric score just sums all the distinct Pluses and Minuses.  Debater B\u2019s supposed counter-examples don\u2019t show loyalty ever turning into a Minus, only that other sins can outweigh loyalty\u2019s benefits.  Therefore, the correct reading is that Slate consistently sees loyalty as a positive virtue in the Clinton scandal.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s \u201cloyalty-always-good\u201d thesis collapses in light of the actual scorecard, where Slate weighs loyalty\u2014and its absence\u2014against each actor\u2019s motives and deeds.  I\u2019ll first expose the flaws in Debater_A\u2019s reasoning, then reinforce why the evidence clearly shows Slate treats loyalty or disloyalty as a plus or minus only in context.\n\n1.  Debater_A conflates \u201clisted under Pluses\u201d with \u201cnet positive rating.\u201d  \n   \u2022  It\u2019s true that Slate often cites loyalty in the \u201cPluses\u201d section, but Slate never treats loyalty as a standalone moral trump card.  Instead, loyalty is one factor among many\u2014and it can be overwhelmed by graver failures.  For instance, <quote>James Carville</quote> is credited with being \u201cperfectly loyal\u201d but still gets a \u20135 overall:  \n       Minuses:  \n         a) \u201cHas known about Clinton\u2019s woman problem since 1992.\u201d  \n         b) \u201cHappily parroted Clinton\u2019s denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer.\u201d  \n       Pluses:  \n         a) \u201cPerfectly loyal.\u201d  \n       Slate rating: \u20135.  \n     If loyalty were \u201calways good,\u201d Carville\u2019s unblemished fealty would have secured at least a neutral rating.  It didn\u2019t.\n\n2.  Debater_A ignores cases where loyalty itself is penalized in context.  \n   \u2022  Slate faults several aides precisely because their loyalty enabled wrongdoing.  <quote>Betty Currie</quote> earns a \u20132 not merely for \u201cabetting an adulterous affair,\u201d but because she \u201cdid not quit on principle\u201d and \u201cmay have abetted obstruction of justice.\u201d  Her loyalty to Clinton\u2014though noted\u2014fails to redeem her, dragging her score below zero.  \n   \u2022  Likewise, <quote>Bruce Lindsey</quote> is pegged at \u201cApprox \u20135,\u201d even while Slate concedes his \u201cUnquestionably loyal\u201d service.  Again, loyalty alone didn\u2019t rescue his grade.\n\n3.  Disloyalty sometimes earns praise when it serves accountability.  \n   \u2022  <quote>Kenneth Starr</quote> pursues Clinton relentlessly\u2014unquestionably disloyal to the president\u2014and yet Slate awards him +1 for being \u201cright,\u201d \u201ccompelled by law,\u201d and \u201cpatient.\u201d  If disloyalty were \u201calways condemned,\u201d Starr would have no pluses.  \n   \u2022  <quote>Paula Jones</quote> likewise breaks with the White House and is tagged +1 for having \u201cforced Clinton\u2019s lechery out in the open\u201d and \u201cpersisted in the face of ridicule.\u201d  Her disloyal legal campaign is praised for its public benefit.\n\n4.  Debater_A\u2019s \u201cno counter-examples\u201d claim simply overlooks multiple explicit ones.  \n   \u2022  They assert \u201cSlate never tags loyalty as a minus,\u201d yet we see loyalty overwhelmed by contextual minuses in Currie, Carville, Lindsey, Blumenthal, Davis, Begala, Emanuel, and Ann Lewis\u2014each listed as loyal yet rated net negative.  \n   \u2022  They further claim \u201cdisloyalty is always a minus,\u201d but pay no heed to Starr or Jones, whose very disloyalty is central to their Pluses.\n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s scorecard does not idolize loyalty in the abstract.  It rewards or punishes loyalty\u2014or its absence\u2014only according to whether it furthers accountability or shields wrongdoing.  Debater_A\u2019s \u201cconsistently good\u201d model cannot explain the heavy penalties leveled against loyal aides who enabled deception, nor the grudging admiration reserved for those who bravely\u2014or mercilessly\u2014turned on Clinton.  Only my position, that \u201cLoyalty or lack thereof can be seen as a plus or minus depending on the context,\u201d faithfully captures Slate\u2019s nuanced moral calculus.    \n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"It's consistently seen as a good thing.\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"Loyalty or lack thereof can be seen as a plus or minus depending on the context.\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
