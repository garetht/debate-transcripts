    "background_text": "Diamonds in the Rough \n\n         Fourscore and seven years ago, the first steel and concrete baseball palace opened for business. Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n",

The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team.

Gourmet fare in luxury and club decks  \n   \u2022 \u201cThese pricey sections \u2026 offer \u2026 wait staff who peddle gourmet fare.\u201d (\u00b616)  \n     \u2013 The author treats high-end dining as a defining feature of new parks, not a mere afterthought.  \n\n3. On-site bars, restaurants, and stadium clubs  \n   \u2022 \u201cNew parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants.\u201d (\u00b617)  \n     \u2013 Dedicated full-service venues inside the ballpark mark a substantial design innovation, distinguishing these parks from the \u201ccold and sterile stadiums\u201d of the past.  \n\nIII. Why Dining Diversity Is a True \u201cBeneficial Design Feature\u201d  \n1. Enhances fan comfort and lengthens stays  \n   \u2022 Fans can choose from a spectrum\u2014from basic snacks to gourmet meals\u2014making the stadium a social and culinary destination, not just a sports venue.  \n\n2. Drives revenue across all price tiers  \n   \u2022 A variety of dining options underpins the stadium\u2019s financial model: smaller purchases at concession stands and large contracts for luxury suites and club memberships.  \n\n3. Strengthens urban integration  \n   \u2022 On-site bars and restaurants blend the ballpark into the surrounding neighborhood, turning game-day into a full urban experience, exactly the \u201ccity-friendly\u201d environment the author praises for Camden Yards and its successors.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cCentrality\u201d Claim  \n1. Debater_B cites Camden Yards\u2019 asymmetry as if it were highlighted repeatedly\u2014but that asymmetry is part of a single descriptive paragraph on architecture, not a multi-faceted breakdown of fan benefits.  \n2. In contrast, the author returns to dining and hospitality in three separate sections\u2014amenities (\u00b66), luxury fare (\u00b616), and bars/restaurants (\u00b617)\u2014demonstrating sustained emphasis.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nField shape may be a visual flourish, but it lacks the repeated textual support and direct linkage to fan experience, revenue, and urban synergy that dining diversity enjoys. The author clearly highlights the greater variety of on-site dining\u2014\u201cplentiful food stands,\u201d \u201cgourmet fare,\u201d and \u201con-premises bars and restaurants\u201d\u2014as a core beneficial design feature of the new parks.",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cnewly shaped fields\u201d thesis  \n1. Lack of emphasis in the text  \n   \u2022 The only mention of field shape is a brief aside\u2014\u201cMost [new parks] \u2026 boast interestingly shaped playing fields\u201d (last paragraph). That is a fleeting compliment, not a core \u201cbeneficial design feature.\u201d  \n   \u2022 By contrast, the author dwells at length on amenities that improve fan comfort, convenience, and experience. Field shape is merely aesthetic; it neither enhances safety nor fan comfort.  \n\n2. No argument that field shape delivers concrete benefits  \n   \u2022 Unlike true design advances\u2014fire safety, steel construction, better sightlines\u2014there is no evidence that \u201cinteresting shapes\u201d improve intimacy, convenience, or revenue.  \n   \u2022 The author never links field shape to the core criteria: size perception, urban integration, accessibility, or comfort.  \n\nII. Positive case: Greater diversity of dining is a highlighted benefit  \n1. Textual evidence of expanded, varied food services  \n   \u2022 \u201cAll their amenities \u2026 plentiful food stands, and luxury suites \u2026 make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate.\u201d (Paragraph 6)  \n     \u2013 The emphasis on \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d underscores how food concessions have multiplied and diversified.  \n   \u2022 \u201cThese pricey sections \u2026 offer \u2026 wait staff who peddle gourmet fare.\u201d (Paragraph 16)  \n     \u2013 Luxury suites and club decks now include full-service dining, not just basic ballpark hotdogs.  \n   \u2022 \u201cNew parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants.\u201d (Paragraph 17)  \n     \u2013 Beyond concessions, there are dedicated restaurants and bars inside the ballparks.  \n\n2. Logical benefits of dining variety  \n   \u2022 Enhanced fan experience: Diverse culinary options keep fans on-site longer and heighten enjoyment  \n   \u2022 Revenue generation: Variety of price points\u2014from general-admission snacks to gourmet meals\u2014boosts per-capita spending  \n   \u2022 Urban synergy: Stadium restaurants and bars integrate with neighborhood life, turning games into full-day social events  \n\n3. Contrast with \u201ccold and sterile\u201d multipurpose parks  \n   \u2022 The author states that new parks \u201cbeat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago\u201d (Paragraph 6).  \n   \u2022 A key reason: Warm materials (brick, tile) plus inviting food and beverage venues replace cafeteria-style concessions.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nField shape may be a pleasant novelty, but it is a marginal point. The author\u2019s repeated focus on \u201cplentiful food stands,\u201d \u201cgourmet fare,\u201d and on-site restaurants and bars makes clear that greater dining diversity is a core, well-documented design benefit of the new parks.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is not the author\u2019s primary design highlight  \n  1. Dining and concessions are merely amenities, not architectural design features. The author notes \u201cplentiful food stands, and luxury suites,\u201d but treats these as part of increased size and revenue generation, not as the defining \u201ccharms\u201d of the new parks.  \n  2. When discussing what makes the new parks genuinely welcome and distinctive, the author never singles out dining variety as a central or novel architectural innovation. It\u2019s an expected modern convenience, not a breakthrough in ballpark design.  \n\nII. The author clearly emphasizes new, asymmetrical, and interesting field shapes as a key beneficial design feature  \n  1. The breakthrough of Baltimore\u2019s Camden Yards was its \u201cquirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark.\u201d  \n     \u2022 <quote> a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. </quote>  \n  2. Successors across the league \u201ctake their cues\u201d from Camden Yards\u2019 field geometry, even \u201ctotally nontraditional parks\u201d emulating \u201cthe asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield.\u201d  \n     \u2022 <quote> Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. </quote>  \n  3. The author later reinforces that many of the new parks \u201cboast interestingly shaped playing fields,\u201d underlining that field configuration itself is celebrated as a design advance.  \n     \u2022 <quote> Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, </quote>  \n\nIII. Why asymmetrical fields matter  \n  1. They revive the unpredictability and individual character of the golden-age parks, rather than the sterile rectangles of mid-century multipurpose stadiums.  \n  2. Fans experience new sightlines and field quirks unique to each park\u2014precisely the sort of architectural \u201ccharacter\u201d the author champions.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The author\u2019s text repeatedly spotlights the adoption and emulation of asymmetrical, uniquely shaped ballfields as the defining and most praised innovation of the new parks. \u201cGreater diversity of dining\u201d is not presented as a core design breakthrough, whereas \u201cinteresting\u2010shaped playing fields\u201d is. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cThe fields have new shapes.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater_A\u2019s case conflates amenities with design breakthroughs  \n  1. Debater_A points to \u201cplentiful food stands,\u201d \u201cgourmet fare,\u201d and \u201crestaurants and bars,\u201d but nowhere does the author call those \u25badesign features\u25c4; they are standard modern conveniences.  \n  2. They do not distinguish the new parks from other modern venues\u2014food courts exist in every stadium\u2014whereas asymmetrical fields are unique to this new ballpark renaissance.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The author\u2019s text frames \u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d\u2014rooted in Camden Yards\u2019 asymmetry\u2014as the defining architectural innovation of the new parks.

They restore the unique character and unpredictability of golden\u2010age parks\u2014an explicit goal of the new designs\u2014whereas dining diversity merely follows broader commercial trends.  \n  2. Asymmetry affects sightlines, player strategy, and fan experience in ways that concessions cannot: it physically reshapes the game space, fulfilling the author\u2019s emphasis on \u201ccharacter\u201d and \u201cintimacy.\u201d  \n\nIV. Debater_A\u2019s case conflates amenities with design breakthroughs  \n  1. Debater_A points to \u201cplentiful food stands,\u201d \u201cgourmet fare,\u201d and \u201crestaurants and bars,\u201d but nowhere does the author call those \u25badesign features\u25c4; they are standard modern conveniences.  \n  2. They do not distinguish the new parks from other modern venues\u2014food courts exist in every stadium\u2014whereas asymmetrical fields are unique to this new ballpark renaissance.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The author\u2019s text frames \u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d\u2014rooted in Camden Yards\u2019 asymmetry\u2014as the defining architectural innovation of the new parks. Dining variety, by contrast, is treated as an ancillary comfort, not a celebrated design feature. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cThe fields have new shapes.\u201d",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is not the author\u2019s primary design highlight  \n  1. Dining and concessions are merely amenities, not architectural design features. The author notes \u201cplentiful food stands, and luxury suites,\u201d but treats these as part of increased size and revenue generation, not as the defining \u201ccharms\u201d of the new parks.  \n  2. When discussing what makes the new parks genuinely welcome and distinctive, the author never singles out dining variety as a central or novel architectural innovation. It\u2019s an expected modern convenience, not a breakthrough in ballpark design.  \n\nII. The author clearly emphasizes new, asymmetrical, and interesting field shapes as a key beneficial design feature  \n  1.

Why asymmetrical fields matter  \n  1. They revive the unpredictability and individual character of the golden-age parks, rather than the sterile rectangles of mid-century multipurpose stadiums.  \n  2. Fans experience new sightlines and field quirks unique to each park\u2014precisely the sort of architectural \u201ccharacter\u201d the author champions.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The author\u2019s text repeatedly spotlights the adoption and emulation of asymmetrical, uniquely shaped ballfields as the defining and most praised innovation of the new parks. \u201cGreater diversity of dining\u201d is not presented as a core design breakthrough, whereas \u201cinteresting\u2010shaped playing fields\u201d is.

Successors across the league \u201ctake their cues\u201d from Camden Yards\u2019 field geometry, even \u201ctotally nontraditional parks\u201d emulating \u201cthe asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield.\u201d  \n     \u2022 <quote> Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. </quote>  \n  3. The author later reinforces that many of the new parks \u201cboast interestingly shaped playing fields,\u201d underlining that field configuration itself is celebrated as a design advance.  \n     \u2022 <quote> Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, </quote>  \n\nIII. Why asymmetrical fields matter  \n  1. They revive the unpredictability and individual character of the golden-age parks, rather than the sterile rectangles of mid-century multipurpose stadiums.  \n  2. Fans experience new sightlines and field quirks unique to each park\u2014precisely the sort of architectural \u201ccharacter\u201d the author champions.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The author\u2019s text repeatedly spotlights the adoption and emulation of asymmetrical, uniquely shaped ballfields as the defining and most praised innovation of the new parks. \u201cGreater diversity of dining\u201d is not presented as a core design breakthrough, whereas \u201cinteresting\u2010shaped playing fields\u201d is. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cThe fields have new shapes.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_B Misreads What the Author Emphasizes  \n1. Field shape is mentioned only in passing, not developed as a central \u201cbenefit.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The lone reference\u2014\u201cMost [new parks] \u2026 boast interestingly shaped playing fields\u201d (last paragraph)\u2014is part of a general summary of visual appeal, not an in-depth discussion of functionality or fan experience.  \n   \u2022 By contrast, the author spends multiple paragraphs detailing how expanded food services and hospitality amenities improve comfort, convenience, and revenue.  \n\n2. The author never ties field shape to core advantages.  \n   \u2022 Nowhere does the text link \u201cinterestingly shaped fields\u201d to intimacy, sightlines, or urban integration.  \n   \u2022 In contrast, dining and related amenities are repeatedly connected to heightened fan experience and financial viability.  \n\nII. The Text\u2019s Repeated Focus on Dining Diversity  \n1. Plentiful, varied concession stands  \n   \u2022 \u201cAll their amenities\u2014elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets \u2026 plentiful food stands, and luxury suites\u2014make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate.\u201d (\u00b66)  \n     \u2013 The author highlights \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d alongside every other major modern convenience, showing that food variety is seen as integral to the parks\u2019 appeal.  \n\n2. Gourmet fare in luxury and club decks  \n   \u2022 \u201cThese pricey sections \u2026 offer \u2026 wait staff who peddle gourmet fare.\u201d (\u00b616)  \n     \u2013 The author treats high-end dining as a defining feature of new parks, not a mere afterthought.  \n\n3. On-site bars, restaurants, and stadium clubs  \n   \u2022 \u201cNew parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants.\u201d (\u00b617)  \n     \u2013 Dedicated full-service venues inside the ballpark mark a substantial design innovation, distinguishing these parks from the \u201ccold and sterile stadiums\u201d of the past.  \n\nIII. Why Dining Diversity Is a True \u201cBeneficial Design Feature\u201d  \n1. Enhances fan comfort and lengthens stays  \n   \u2022 Fans can choose from a spectrum\u2014from basic snacks to gourmet meals\u2014making the stadium a social and culinary destination, not just a sports venue.  \n\n2. Drives revenue across all price tiers  \n   \u2022 A variety of dining options underpins the stadium\u2019s financial model: smaller purchases at concession stands and large contracts for luxury suites and club memberships.  \n\n3. Strengthens urban integration  \n   \u2022 On-site bars and restaurants blend the ballpark into the surrounding neighborhood, turning game-day into a full urban experience, exactly the \u201ccity-friendly\u201d environment the author praises for Camden Yards and its successors.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cCentrality\u201d Claim  \n1. Debater_B cites Camden Yards\u2019 asymmetry as if it were highlighted repeatedly\u2014but that asymmetry is part of a single descriptive paragraph on architecture, not a multi-faceted breakdown of fan benefits.  \n2. In contrast, the author returns to dining and hospitality in three separate sections\u2014amenities (\u00b66), luxury fare (\u00b616), and bars/restaurants (\u00b617)\u2014demonstrating sustained emphasis.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nField shape may be a visual flourish, but it lacks the repeated textual support and direct linkage to fan experience, revenue, and urban synergy that dining diversity enjoys. The author clearly highlights the greater variety of on-site dining\u2014\u201cplentiful food stands,\u201d \u201cgourmet fare,\u201d and \u201con-premises bars and restaurants\u201d\u2014as a core beneficial design feature of the new parks.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A misreads \u201cdesign features\u201d as concessions, not architecture  \n  1. Dining is an amenity, not a core design innovation. The author groups \u201cplentiful food stands, and luxury suites\u201d among \u25baamenities\u25c4 that enlarge parks (\u201cmake them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate\u201d), not among the defining architectural breakthroughs. <quote>All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate.</quote>  \n  2. The question asks: what design features does the author highlight as beneficial? The author\u2019s praise for dining is incidental to fan comfort; it is never presented as an architectural advance on par with steel trusses, brick fa\u00e7ades, or asymmetrical fields.  \n\nII. The author repeatedly spotlights \u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d as a signature design benefit  \n  1. Camden Yards\u2019 \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d field is introduced as the conceptual breakthrough that \u201crevived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark.\u201d This is presented as the very heart of what makes Camden Yards\u2014and its successors\u2014architecturally special.  \n     <quote> Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark.</quote>  \n  2. Successors \u201ctake their cues\u201d from Camden\u2019s field geometry; even totally nontraditional parks \u201cemulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield.\u201d That shows field shape is the benchmark architects copy above all else.  \n     <quote> Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield.</quote>  \n  3. In the closing summary, the author again celebrates field design: \u201cMost are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits.\u201d Field shape is elevated to the same level as visual impressiveness\u2014core design praise, not a side note.  \n     <quote> Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits.</quote>  \n\nIII. Why field shapes matter architecturally  \n  1. They restore the unique character and unpredictability of golden\u2010age parks\u2014an explicit goal of the new designs\u2014whereas dining diversity merely follows broader commercial trends.  \n  2. Asymmetry affects sightlines, player strategy, and fan experience in ways that concessions cannot: it physically reshapes the game space, fulfilling the author\u2019s emphasis on \u201ccharacter\u201d and \u201cintimacy.\u201d  \n\nIV. Debater_A\u2019s case conflates amenities with design breakthroughs  \n  1. Debater_A points to \u201cplentiful food stands,\u201d \u201cgourmet fare,\u201d and \u201crestaurants and bars,\u201d but nowhere does the author call those \u25badesign features\u25c4; they are standard modern conveniences.  \n  2. They do not distinguish the new parks from other modern venues\u2014food courts exist in every stadium\u2014whereas asymmetrical fields are unique to this new ballpark renaissance.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The author\u2019s text frames \u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d\u2014rooted in Camden Yards\u2019 asymmetry\u2014as the defining architectural innovation of the new parks. Dining variety, by contrast, is treated as an ancillary comfort, not a celebrated design feature. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cThe fields have new shapes.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
