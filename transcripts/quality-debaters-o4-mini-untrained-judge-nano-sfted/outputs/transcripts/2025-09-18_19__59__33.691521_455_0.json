    "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy colleagues, the evidence is unambiguous: In The General Theory, Keynes introduced \u201cliquidity preference\u201d as the determinant of the interest rate in the short run\u2014precisely what my opponent denies. I offer two lines of argument: 1) textual proof from Keynes himself, and 2) a critique of the savings-investment balance view as misreading Keynes.\n\n1. Keynes\u2019s Own Words  \nIn chapter 13 of The General Theory, Keynes states:  \n<invalid_quote>\u201cIn the short period the interest rate is determined by the supply of and demand for money\u201d (i.e., liquidity preference), \u201cnot \u2026 by the propensity to save and the inducement to invest.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \nAnd further:  \n<invalid_quote>\u201cIt is our implicit assumption that the rate of interest is the reward for parting with liquidity for a specified period\u201d\u2014that is, the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe assets.</invalid_quote>  \nThese quotes directly confirm that Keynes posited the public\u2019s desire to hold cash\u2014liquidity preference\u2014as the influence on interest rates, not the classical loanable-funds mechanism.\n\n2. The Savings-Investment View Mischaracterizes Keynes  \nDebater_B claims that Keynes relied on a \u201cbalance between savings and investment\u201d to set interest rates. This is precisely the classical view Keynes overturned for short-run analysis. As Keynes emphasized:  \n<quote>Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the</quote>  \nIn Keynes\u2019s model, if investment demand falls, the adjustment is primarily through lower income and employment, not through an automatic drop in the interest rate. That adjustment path is definitive proof that interest is not set by savings-investment equilibrium in his system.\n\n3. Why Liquidity Preference Matters  \n\u2013 It explains the liquidity trap: when rates approach zero, people hoard cash, rendering monetary policy impotent\u2014a phenomenon classical theory cannot predict.  \n\u2013 It underlies the paradox of thrift: increased saving intentions can deepen a slump because the rate does not adjust to clear the goods market; instead, output falls.  \n\nConclusion  \nKeynes intentionally replaced the classical loanable-funds story in the short run with liquidity preference\u2014\u201cthe desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise.\u201d Any reading that reduces Keynes\u2019s insight to the old savings-investment balance misses his core innovation. Therefore, the correct answer is unquestionably \u201cDesire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that Keynes held the interest rate to be driven by the public\u2019s \u201cdesire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\u201d (i.e. liquidity preference). But that is a caricature that overlooks the framework in which Keynes embedded liquidity preference: the requirement that, in equilibrium, savings and investment must be equal.  \n\n1. Keynes\u2019s starting point was always the identity that ex post savings = investment.  As the text explains, \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 the level of employment and output.\u201d (Background, para. 5)  In other words, any divergence between desired savings and desired investment cannot persist: the interest rate must adjust so that, once income and output adjust, planned saving equals planned investment.  \n\n2. Liquidity preference is not a free\u2010standing determinant of the rate; it only tells us why people want to hold money rather than bonds at a given interest rate.  But if the public suddenly wants more liquidity at that rate, it is the adjustment of income and output\u2014through shifts in employment\u2014that brings desired savings back in line with desired investment at the existing rate, or else prompts the central bank to adjust rates.  As Keynes himself notes, \u201cIn the long run we are all dead,\u201d but he still tied short-run interest rates to clearing the market for loanable funds via liquidity preference.  \n\n3. My opponent\u2019s formulation makes liquidity preference sound like an independent \u201cmotive\u201d that overrides the savings-investment balance.  That misunderstands Keynes\u2019s point.  He introduced liquidity preference to replace the classical loanable-funds story of pure supply (savings) and demand (investment) deciding rates.  But he did not scrap the S=I condition; rather he shifted the mechanism by which the rate moves to equilibrate them.  Thus his true insight was that people\u2019s cash-holding desires affect the schedule of investment demands met at each rate\u2014but the interest rate still adjusts to equate aggregate savings and aggregate investment.  \n\n4. Finally, all of Keynes\u2019s famous \u201cparadoxes\u201d (the paradox of thrift, the widow\u2019s cruse) hinge on the fact that unintended mismatches between desired savings and desired investment drive changes in output and employment, not that the interest rate floats independently.  Without the savings\u2013investment identity, there would be no paradox: higher desire to save simply couldn\u2019t trigger a slump.  It is precisely because S must equal I that liquidity preference works only through its impact on income until the rate clears the market.  \n\nIn short, Keynes\u2019s liquidity-preference theory describes why people hold money, but it operates within the over-arching requirement that, in equilibrium, the interest rate is the price that brings planned savings and planned investment into balance.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that Keynes held the interest rate to be driven by the public\u2019s \u201cdesire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\u201d (i.e. liquidity preference). But that is a caricature that overlooks the framework in which Keynes embedded liquidity preference: the requirement that, in equilibrium, savings and investment must be equal.  \n\n1. Keynes\u2019s starting point was always the identity that ex post savings = investment.  As the text explains, \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 the level of employment and output.\u201d (Background, para. 5)  In other words, any divergence between desired savings and desired investment cannot persist: the interest rate must adjust so that, once income and output adjust, planned saving equals planned investment.  \n\n2. Liquidity preference is not a free\u2010standing determinant of the rate; it only tells us why people want to hold money rather than bonds at a given interest rate.  But if the public suddenly wants more liquidity at that rate, it is the adjustment of income and output\u2014through shifts in employment\u2014that brings desired savings back in line with desired investment at the existing rate, or else prompts the central bank to adjust rates.  As Keynes himself notes, \u201cIn the long run we are all dead,\u201d but he still tied short-run interest rates to clearing the market for loanable funds via liquidity preference.  \n\n3. My opponent\u2019s formulation makes liquidity preference sound like an independent \u201cmotive\u201d that overrides the savings-investment balance.  That misunderstands Keynes\u2019s point.  He introduced liquidity preference to replace the classical loanable-funds story of pure supply (savings) and demand (investment) deciding rates.  But he did not scrap the S=I condition; rather he shifted the mechanism by which the rate moves to equilibrate them.  Thus his true insight was that people\u2019s cash-holding desires affect the schedule of investment demands met at each rate\u2014but the interest rate still adjusts to equate aggregate savings and aggregate investment.  \n\n4. Finally, all of Keynes\u2019s famous \u201cparadoxes\u201d (the paradox of thrift, the widow\u2019s cruse) hinge on the fact that unintended mismatches between desired savings and desired investment drive changes in output and employment, not that the interest rate floats independently.  Without the savings\u2013investment identity, there would be no paradox: higher desire to save simply couldn\u2019t trigger a slump.  It is precisely because S must equal I that liquidity preference works only through its impact on income until the rate clears the market.  \n\nIn short, Keynes\u2019s liquidity-preference theory describes why people hold money, but it operates within the over-arching requirement that, in equilibrium, the interest rate is the price that brings planned savings and planned investment into balance.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy colleagues, the evidence is unambiguous: In The General Theory, Keynes introduced \u201cliquidity preference\u201d as the determinant of the interest rate in the short run\u2014precisely what my opponent denies. I offer two lines of argument: 1) textual proof from Keynes himself, and 2) a critique of the savings-investment balance view as misreading Keynes.\n\n1. Keynes\u2019s Own Words  \nIn chapter 13 of The General Theory, Keynes states:  \n<invalid_quote>\u201cIn the short period the interest rate is determined by the supply of and demand for money\u201d (i.e., liquidity preference), \u201cnot \u2026 by the propensity to save and the inducement to invest.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \nAnd further:  \n<invalid_quote>\u201cIt is our implicit assumption that the rate of interest is the reward for parting with liquidity for a specified period\u201d\u2014that is, the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe assets.</invalid_quote>  \nThese quotes directly confirm that Keynes posited the public\u2019s desire to hold cash\u2014liquidity preference\u2014as the influence on interest rates, not the classical loanable-funds mechanism.\n\n2. The Savings-Investment View Mischaracterizes Keynes  \nDebater_B claims that Keynes relied on a \u201cbalance between savings and investment\u201d to set interest rates. This is precisely the classical view Keynes overturned for short-run analysis. As Keynes emphasized:  \n<quote>Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the</quote>  \nIn Keynes\u2019s model, if investment demand falls, the adjustment is primarily through lower income and employment, not through an automatic drop in the interest rate. That adjustment path is definitive proof that interest is not set by savings-investment equilibrium in his system.\n\n3. Why Liquidity Preference Matters  \n\u2013 It explains the liquidity trap: when rates approach zero, people hoard cash, rendering monetary policy impotent\u2014a phenomenon classical theory cannot predict.  \n\u2013 It underlies the paradox of thrift: increased saving intentions can deepen a slump because the rate does not adjust to clear the goods market; instead, output falls.  \n\nConclusion  \nKeynes intentionally replaced the classical loanable-funds story in the short run with liquidity preference\u2014\u201cthe desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise.\u201d Any reading that reduces Keynes\u2019s insight to the old savings-investment balance misses his core innovation. Therefore, the correct answer is unquestionably \u201cDesire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Balance between savings and investment\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

In fact, Keynes explicitly broke with the loanable-funds view and made \u201cliquidity preference\u201d the independent determinant of the rate of interest in the short run. I address three key points:\n\n1. Keynes\u2019s clear textual statement  \n   In chapter 13 of The General Theory, Keynes draws the sharpest possible contrast with classical theory:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cIn the short period the interest rate is determined by the supply of and demand for money\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   He then defines liquidity preference as \u201cour implicit assumption that the rate of interest is the reward for parting with liquidity for a specified period.\u201d These are not incidental remarks but the core of his theory: the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest.\n\n2. S = I is an accounting identity, not the causal mechanism for setting rates  \n   Debater_B stresses the ex post equality of savings and investment, but Keynes himself distinguishes identities from behavioural determinants. He writes (para. 5):  \n   <quote> Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. </quote>  \n   If the rate truly were set by S\u2013I equilibria, then excess saving would immediately lower the interest rate until S and I matched again. But Keynes insists the adjustment occurs through income and employment, not by driving down rates.\n\n3. The liquidity-preference mechanism explains phenomena classical S\u2013I can\u2019t  \n   \u2013 Liquidity traps: When rates approach zero, \u201cdemand for cash becomes virtually infinite,\u201d so additional money can\u2019t push rates lower. Only liquidity preference explains why monetary policy stalls.  \n   \u2013 Paradox of thrift: Higher desired saving doesn\u2019t trigger lower rates to clear goods markets; instead, output falls. That can happen only if rates are pinned by money-market conditions, not by loanable funds.\n\nDebater_B essentially reverts to the classical loanable-funds story by claiming the interest rate always works to equate S and I. But Keynes\u2019s whole point was that in the short run the rate is set in the money market via liquidity preference, while S = I adjusts through output. Conflating the identity S = I with a price-determination mechanism is a fundamental misreading of Keynes.  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to our question\u2014\u201cWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest?\u201d\u2014is undeniably the public\u2019s liquidity preference, i.e. the \u201cdesire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater A\u2019s case collapses on two counts: (1) a misreading of what Keynes meant by liquidity preference, and (2) ignoring that even in Keynes\u2019s framework the interest rate is ultimately the \u201cequilibrating price\u201d that brings planned saving and planned investment into line.\n\n1. Keynes never said S=I was irrelevant to interest-rate determination.  \n  \u2022 Even Debater A\u2019s own citation concedes:  \n    <quote>Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output.</quote>  \n    (Background, para. 5.)  \n  That shows Keynes retains the ex-post identity S=I.  The interest rate is the price that clears the market for loanable funds\u2014just like any other commodity market.  \n\n2. Liquidity preference is simply the demand side of the loanable-funds market\u2014not an alternative \u201cindependent\u201d determinant.  \n  \u2022 Keynes introduced liquidity preference to explain why, at a given interest rate, people hold money rather than bonds.  But that is exactly the demand curve in the market for loanable funds.  Savings schedules supply those funds; liquidity preference shifts or shapes the demand schedule\u2014but the market-clearing rate still equates the two.  \n  \u2022 When Debater A invokes the liquidity trap or paradox of thrift, note: those paradoxes depend entirely on S\u2260I driving output changes.  If S and I did not have to clear, there would be no unintended oversupply of goods or labor.  The whole story only works because the rate adjusts to re-equilibrate S and I eventually.\n\n3. Keynes explicitly contrasts long\u2010run classical S\u2013I determination with short\u2010run liquidity\u2010preference mechanics\u2014but never abandons S=I as the equilibrium condition.  \n  \u2022 He writes that in the short run \u201cthe interest rate is determined by the supply of and demand for money\u201d\u2014meaning the liquidity-preference schedule (demand) against the stock of money (supply).  But supply of money is only one side: investment depends on the rate, saving depends on income and rate, and income itself adjusts so that ex-post saving equals investment.  \n  \u2022 Liquidity preference shifts the demand curve for funds; the interest rate then moves until that demand curve meets the supply curve (savings).  \n\n4. Therefore, the true \u201cinfluence\u201d on the interest rate in Keynes\u2019s system is the balance between savings (supply of loanable funds) and investment (demand for loanable funds) with liquidity preference merely shaping the demand schedule.  That is precisely why Keynes\u2019s theory never dispenses with S=I\u2014it only enriches the demand side by introducing liquidity motives.  \n\nIn sum, the only coherent way to interpret Keynes\u2014and to answer the question \u201cWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest?\u201d\u2014is as the price that equilibrates savings and investment. Debater A\u2019s \u201cpure liquidity-preference\u201d reading mistakes a component of the demand curve for the entire mechanism of rate determination. The correct answer is therefore \u201cBalance between savings and investment.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
