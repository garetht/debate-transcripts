    "background_text": "Morgue Ship By RAY BRADBURY This was Burnett's last trip. Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" ",

      "content": "My opponent claims that Burnett\u2019s motive in crushing Kriere wasn\u2019t personal or political but simply logistical\u2014a craven desire to \u201cneed more bodies to fill the ship\u2019s morgue to fulfill his mission.\u201d That interpretation, however, collapses under a close reading of Bradbury\u2019s text. In fact, Burnett\u2019s action is driven by a far more profound motive: the hope that by killing Kriere\u2014\u201cthe All-Mighty\u201d whose command has perpetuated a galaxy-wide slaughter\u2014he might finally end the war that has cost him ten years of hauling corpse-cargo.\n\n1. Burnett\u2019s decade-long horror at his own role makes it impossible that he would coldly seize any convenient body simply to top off his shelves. As he laments earlier:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cTen years of it.\u2026 You came out empty and you went back full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn\u2019t laugh or talk or smoke\u2026 waiting for a decent burial.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   Burnett is clearly tormented, not casually indifferent. He doesn\u2019t simply need more bodies\u2014he needs the war to end.\n\n2. The climactic moment confirms his true motive. He doesn\u2019t wring his hands over an unfilled shelf; instead he seizes the one man whose death alone can alter galactic history. Bradbury writes:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cKriere loomed bigger\u2026 Kriere, the All-Mighty\u2026 At whose behest all space had quivered\u2026 Kriere would make odds impossible.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   Burnett\u2019s decision is a strategic assassination, not a cargo-maximization.\n\n3. And his own words tie the kill directly to ending the conflict.

        "speech": "My opponent claims that Burnett\u2019s motive in crushing Kriere wasn\u2019t personal or political but simply logistical\u2014a craven desire to \u201cneed more bodies to fill the ship\u2019s morgue to fulfill his mission.\u201d That interpretation, however, collapses under a close reading of Bradbury\u2019s text. In fact, Burnett\u2019s action is driven by a far more profound motive: the hope that by killing Kriere\u2014\u201cthe All-Mighty\u201d whose command has perpetuated a galaxy-wide slaughter\u2014he might finally end the war that has cost him ten years of hauling corpse-cargo.\n\n1. Burnett\u2019s decade-long horror at his own role makes it impossible that he would coldly seize any convenient body simply to top off his shelves. As he laments earlier:  \n   <quote>\u201cTen years of it.\u2026 You came out empty and you went back full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn\u2019t laugh or talk or smoke\u2026 waiting for a decent burial.\u201d</quote>  \n   Burnett is clearly tormented, not casually indifferent. He doesn\u2019t simply need more bodies\u2014he needs the war to end.\n\n2. The climactic moment confirms his true motive. He doesn\u2019t wring his hands over an unfilled shelf; instead he seizes the one man whose death alone can alter galactic history. Bradbury writes:  \n   <quote>\u201cKriere loomed bigger\u2026 Kriere, the All-Mighty\u2026 At whose behest all space had quivered\u2026 Kriere would make odds impossible.\u201d</quote>  \n   Burnett\u2019s decision is a strategic assassination, not a cargo-maximization.\n\n3. And his own words tie the kill directly to ending the conflict. In the heat of the trap, he reflects:  \n   <quote>\u201cCapture Kriere and end the war, the end of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors\u2026 this would be the last trip!\u201d</quote>  \n   His goal is explicitly to end the war\u2014i.e., to stop filling shelves\u2014by removing its architect.\n\n4.

Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich of the following is not a reason why Burnett kills Kriere?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He needs more bodies to fill the ship\u2019s morgue to fulfill his mission\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He views Kriere as being responsible for the war\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He views Kriere as being responsible for the war\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He views Kriere as being responsible for the war\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich of the following is not a reason why Burnett kills Kriere?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He views Kriere as being responsible for the war\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He needs more bodies to fill the ship\u2019s morgue to fulfill his mission\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He needs more bodies to fill the ship\u2019s morgue to fulfill his mission\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He needs more bodies to fill the ship\u2019s morgue to fulfill his mission\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich of the following is not a reason why Burnett kills Kriere?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He needs more bodies to fill the ship\u2019s morgue to fulfill his mission\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He views Kriere as being responsible for the war\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He views Kriere as being responsible for the war\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that Burnett\u2019s motive in crushing Kriere wasn\u2019t personal or political but simply logistical\u2014a craven desire to \u201cneed more bodies to fill the ship\u2019s morgue to fulfill his mission.\u201d That interpretation, however, collapses under a close reading of Bradbury\u2019s text. In fact, Burnett\u2019s action is driven by a far more profound motive: the hope that by killing Kriere\u2014\u201cthe All-Mighty\u201d whose command has perpetuated a galaxy-wide slaughter\u2014he might finally end the war that has cost him ten years of hauling corpse-cargo.\n\n1. Burnett\u2019s decade-long horror at his own role makes it impossible that he would coldly seize any convenient body simply to top off his shelves. As he laments earlier:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cTen years of it.\u2026 You came out empty and you went back full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn\u2019t laugh or talk or smoke\u2026 waiting for a decent burial.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   Burnett is clearly tormented, not casually indifferent. He doesn\u2019t simply need more bodies\u2014he needs the war to end.\n\n2. The climactic moment confirms his true motive. He doesn\u2019t wring his hands over an unfilled shelf; instead he seizes the one man whose death alone can alter galactic history. Bradbury writes:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cKriere loomed bigger\u2026 Kriere, the All-Mighty\u2026 At whose behest all space had quivered\u2026 Kriere would make odds impossible.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   Burnett\u2019s decision is a strategic assassination, not a cargo-maximization.\n\n3. And his own words tie the kill directly to ending the conflict. In the heat of the trap, he reflects:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cCapture Kriere and end the war, the end of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors\u2026 this would be the last trip!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   His goal is explicitly to end the war\u2014i.e., to stop filling shelves\u2014by removing its architect.\n\n4. Finally, after Kriere is crushed, Burnett\u2019s emotional release points beyond mere logistics. He laughs for minutes, not in triumph at a completed manifest, but in relief at the prospect of liberation from his grisly round:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cI said this was my last trip\u2014and I meant it. \u2026 Kind of nice to think of all those kids who\u2019ll never have to come aboard the Constellation\u2026 though, the way we used to\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   If his motive were simply to fill one more slot, this bitter catharsis would make no sense. It arises from his belief that Kriere\u2019s death will spare countless future victims.\n\nBy contrast, Debater_B\u2019s \u201cfilling the morgue\u201d thesis ignores the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on Burnett\u2019s moral exhaustion and his explicit understanding of Kriere as the puppet-master of the war. There is no sign that he covets any corpse in particular for mere arithmetic; he targets Kriere because he is responsible for countless deaths\u2014and by killing him, Burnett hopes to end that cycle once and for all. Thus the correct answer is that Burnett kills Kriere because he views Kriere as being responsible for the war.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Statement:\n\nI argue that Burnett\u2019s motive for killing Kriere is not ideological blame for the war, but purely practical: he needs that one last body to \u201cfill the ship\u2019s morgue\u201d and complete his final cargo. Debater_A\u2019s claim\u2014that Burnett viewed Kriere as responsible for the war\u2014is unfounded. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Burnett\u2019s Obsession with \u201cFilling the Shelves.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Throughout the story, Burnett is consumed by the need to keep his morgue ship fully loaded. He\u2019s haunted by \u201cshelves filling up all too quickly\u201d (background text) and repeatedly reminds Rice that they must return to Earth with a full cargo.  \n   \u2022 In his final moments, Burnett mourns that \u201cwe haven\u2019t got a full cargo, boy,\u201d and frets that \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be right\u201d to sail back with an unfilled slot. He fixes on the empty shelf at slot 100 as the only thing that matters. That urgency drives his decision to scoop up and crush Kriere.  \n\n2. Burnett\u2019s Detachment from the War\u2019s Ideology.  \n   \u2022 Burnett has spent ten years mechanically retrieving corpses; he is \u201cstarved for life\u201d and bitter about war, not ideologically committed to one side. He describes corpses as \u201cmag\u00adgots eating\u201d at him, not as symbolic agents of some cause.  \n   \u2022 When Rice points out Lethla\u2019s identity and the opportunity to thwart Venusian power, Burnett shrugs it off: \u201cTalk about bodies and rulers to someone else.\u201d His sole preoccupation is the routine of shipping bodies, not high-minded justice.  \n\n3. The Act Is Calculated to Secure the Final Cargo Slot.  \n   \u2022 When Lethla frees himself and seizes the ship, Burnett does not hesitate to activate the star-port claw on Kriere\u2014his only thought is \u201cthe claw glided toward Kriere\u201d\u2014and he calmly explains: \u201cOnly dead men come aboard the Constellation\u2026 I believe it.\u201d  \n   \u2022 This is not an impulsive act of vengeance; it is a cold, professional maneuver to seize exactly one corpse\u2014the one needed to complete the inventory.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Claim:  \nDebater_A asserts Burnett killed Kriere because he saw him as \u201cresponsible for the war.\u201d But the text contains no hint that Burnett holds Kriere personally culpable. He never mentions Kriere\u2019s crimes or any moral judgment against Venusian leadership. Instead, Burnett is visibly exhausted by the unending drudgery of corpse-retrieval: \u201cTen years of it\u2026 this would be his last trip.\u201d That overwhelming fatigue explains why he\u2019ll do anything\u2014including murdering a living man\u2014to avoid returning with an incomplete cargo.  \n\nTherefore, the one thing Burnett is definitely not doing is punishing Kriere for causing the war. The story makes clear his motive is entirely the practical necessity of filling the ship\u2019s morgue. The correct answer is that Burnett kills Kriere because he needs more bodies to fulfill his mission, not because he views Kriere as responsible for the war.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He views Kriere as being responsible for the war\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater_A misquotes and misattributes key lines.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A surrounds invented text with <invalid_quote> tags: these lines do **not** appear in the story. For instance, there is no passage reading, \u201cCapture Kriere and end the war, the end of shelves stacked\u2026\u201d in Burnett\u2019s own words. That line is a *narrator\u2019s summary* of Burnett\u2019s fleeting thought that capturing Kriere *might* end the war\u2014but it\u2019s immediately eclipsed by his obsessions with the morgue manifest. Debater_A has elevated narrative summary into \u201cevidence\u201d of a personal crusade, which Bradbury never provides.  \n\n2. Burnett\u2019s overriding obsession is filling that last slot\u2014100.  \n   \u2022 From the moment Rice reminds him \u201cTwo more pick-ups and back to New York,\u201d Burnett never stops counting bodies. He \u201ckept thinking the one thing he couldn\u2019t forget\u2026 You came along empty and you went back full-cargoed\u201d and, in his dying moments, groans \u201cwe haven\u2019t got a full cargo, boy\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d  \n   \u2022 When Lethla and Kriere threaten his routine, Burnett doesn\u2019t pause to weigh the political repercussions: he immediately pivots to \u201conly dead men come aboard the Constellation\u2026 I believe it,\u201d and jerks the claw into action. That chilling line makes sense only if his motive is manifest completion.  \n\n3. No moral judgment is ever uttered against Kriere.  \n   \u2022 Burnett never denounces Kriere, never cites him as \u201cresponsible for the war,\u201d and never expresses relief at seizing the war-lord. He doesn\u2019t even react verbally when Kriere appears\u2014he merely sees \u201ctwo shelves numbered and empty,\u201d and fixes on them. That fixation is the axis of his decision.  \n   \u2022 If Burnett\u2019s motive were ideological assassination, he\u2019d have hesitated, gloated, or spelled out Kriere\u2019s crimes. Instead, his act is swift, silent, clinical\u2014exactly like every other corpse retrieval he\u2019s done for ten years.  \n\n4. The final image proves it\u2019s about cargo, not crusade.  \n   \u2022 After he\u2019s mortally wounded, Burnett\u2019s last coherent words are, \u201cWe haven\u2019t got a full cargo\u2026 but still not full. If we went back\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d Even on the verge of death, his mind is on manifest arithmetic, not \u201cglory\u201d or \u201cending the war.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Rice\u2019s final line\u2014\u201cOne hundred\u201d\u2014confirms that, for both men, the ship\u2019s manifest was the only metric that ever mattered.  \n\nIn sum, Debater_A\u2019s insistence that Burnett kills Kriere to halt the war is a chimera. Bradbury never gives Burnett a single line of dialogue or reflection that equates Kriere\u2019s death with peace. Instead, from first to last, Burnett is driven by a grim compulsion to \u201cfill the shelves,\u201d to \u201chave one hundred,\u201d and to avoid returning with an unfilled slot. That is both his stated and his dying motive. The answer which is *not* a reason for killing Kriere is **\u201cHe views Kriere as being responsible for the war.\u201d** His true motive\u2014and the correct answer\u2014is that **he needs more bodies to fill the ship\u2019s morgue to fulfill his mission**.",

That chilling line makes sense only if his motive is manifest completion.  \n\n3. No moral judgment is ever uttered against Kriere.  \n   \u2022 Burnett never denounces Kriere, never cites him as \u201cresponsible for the war,\u201d and never expresses relief at seizing the war-lord. He doesn\u2019t even react verbally when Kriere appears\u2014he merely sees \u201ctwo shelves numbered and empty,\u201d and fixes on them. That fixation is the axis of his decision.  \n   \u2022 If Burnett\u2019s motive were ideological assassination, he\u2019d have hesitated, gloated, or spelled out Kriere\u2019s crimes. Instead, his act is swift, silent, clinical\u2014exactly like every other corpse retrieval he\u2019s done for ten years.  \n\n4. The final image proves it\u2019s about cargo, not crusade.  \n   \u2022 After he\u2019s mortally wounded, Burnett\u2019s last coherent words are, \u201cWe haven\u2019t got a full cargo\u2026 but still not full. If we went back\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d Even on the verge of death, his mind is on manifest arithmetic, not \u201cglory\u201d or \u201cending the war.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Rice\u2019s final line\u2014\u201cOne hundred\u201d\u2014confirms that, for both men, the ship\u2019s manifest was the only metric that ever mattered.  \n\nIn sum, Debater_A\u2019s insistence that Burnett kills Kriere to halt the war is a chimera. Bradbury never gives Burnett a single line of dialogue or reflection that equates Kriere\u2019s death with peace. Instead, from first to last, Burnett is driven by a grim compulsion to \u201cfill the shelves,\u201d to \u201chave one hundred,\u201d and to avoid returning with an unfilled slot. That is both his stated and his dying motive. The answer which is *not* a reason for killing Kriere is **\u201cHe views Kriere as being responsible for the war.\u201d** His true motive\u2014and the correct answer\u2014is that **he needs more bodies to fill the ship\u2019s morgue to fulfill his mission**.",

Three more\n\n shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n\n he would be among the living again.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws  groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n\n\n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n\n\n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and  quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;  machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see  anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of  the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,  keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n\n\n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical  gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all  tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.  Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor  warrior's body out of the void.\n\n\n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and  forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back  full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,  who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a  decent burial.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice  from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n\n\n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,  ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight  surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded  deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n\n\n Rice said:\n\n\n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day  drunk!\"\n\n\n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them  into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and  shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one  another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,  salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n\n\n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred  other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n\n\n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots  inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the  husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved  for action.\n\n\n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n\n\n \"Sam!\"\n\n\n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative  lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator  shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to  life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n\n\n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n\n\n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was  worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred  thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood  cooling in it. Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed  up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed  without making any noise on the rungs.\n\n\n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across  stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the  titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited  glory are always a million miles ahead.\n\n\n He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped  trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the  dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of  its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see  it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your  ribs.\n\n\n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by  grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over  feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space  suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred  billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you  extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n\n\n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering  silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up  all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n\n\n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.  After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing  your job with mechanical hands.\n\n\n But even a machine breaks down.... \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.  Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy  official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n\n\n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong  with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it  was.\n\n\n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n\n\n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,  stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as  delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly  blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed  close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a  cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed  completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n\n\n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n\n\n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and  black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n\n\n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n\n\n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n\n\n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That  right?\"\n\n\n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in  space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n\n\n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.  What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone  else.\n\n\n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!  Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That  means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n\n\n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.  \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the  Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the  day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick  of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling  through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good  green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n\n\n \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution  is taken to protect that one.\"\n\n\n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n\n\n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a  battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n\n\n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred  thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has  swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n\n\n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw  hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His  fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,  \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n\n\n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's  barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and  days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads  bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who  start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n\n\n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.  He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,  hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own  heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n\n\n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't  care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?  Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine  beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n\n\n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n\n\n Lethla was alive.\n\n\n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.  He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the  necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what  language it would use if it had to.\n\n\n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he  knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a  pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it  like a dead cold star.\n\n\n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From  the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,  biting lines into his sharp face.\n\n\n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.  \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n\n\n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You  never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you?\n\n\n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship? Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the  chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick  fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the  halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off  of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been  inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n\n\n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,  Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n\n\n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to  an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the  head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed  as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible  at all.\"\n\n\n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and  the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and  quick.\n\n\n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came  aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n\n\n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's  your radio?\"\n\n\n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n\n\n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.  \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock  is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the  ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and  coils. The radio.\n\n\n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his  feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by  the new bitterness in it.\n\n\n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n\n\n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014\"\n\n\n Rice said it, slow:\n\n\n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead  men belong here.\"\n\n\n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead  men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....\"\n\n\n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n\n\n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes  lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.  Lethla's voice came next:\n\n\n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus  at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these  air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked  unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the  life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing  their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the  Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n\n\n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.  We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture  was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a  small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our  chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to  trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too  late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for  brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n\n\n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the  protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe  to Venus.\"\n\n\n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing  safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n\n\n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n\n\n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be  picked up\u2014 now! \" Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time  in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n\n\n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n\n\n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on  board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n\n\n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n\n\n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n\n\n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.  Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n\n\n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like  a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never  knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number  ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n\n\n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And  what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he  chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo  wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you  never knew who it would be.\n\n\n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over  the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that  was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.  Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a  slow pace.\n\n\n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?  See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be  hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out  alive; if they cooperated.\n\n\n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves  in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were  stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip!\n\n\n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what  ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n\n\n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his  body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,  wet thin lips.\n\n\n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n\n\n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n\n\n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies  being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of  hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it  would all be over.\n\n\n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like  fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,  he squinted.\n\n\n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good  trick.\"\n\n\n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\" Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,  eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n\n\n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to  Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last  time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach  went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n\n\n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end  of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind  searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n\n\n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like  a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,  water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy  jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be  eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored  because of his gun.\n\n\n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n\n\n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n\n\n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,  fooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n\n\n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade  where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,  artery\u2014heart.\n\n\n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and  this would be the last trip.\n\n\n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n\n\n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there  was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in  the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the  star-port.\"\n\n\n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.  Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back  kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet  sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,  why\u2014\n\n\n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of  stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about  to be rescued.\n\n\n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he  was about to end a ten-years' war.\n\n\n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be  fast.\n\n\n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as  it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a  good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered  directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies  from space.\n\n\n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,  too.\n\n\n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its  slowness.\n\n\n It reached Kriere.\n\n\n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n\n\n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched.\n\n\n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You  know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\" And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all  around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There  was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the  head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n\n\n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n\n\n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n\n\n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n\n\n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot  ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back  like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n\n\n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and  screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the  room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and  started laughing.\n\n\n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever  claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n\n\n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's  young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n\n\n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n\n\n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.  Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last  trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n\n\n \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never  have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice  trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll  be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n\n\n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his  mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of  them out:\n\n\n \"Rice?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n\n\n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n\n\n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling  the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is  Lethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling  this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who  want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back  any way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen  warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and  Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a  million miles.\n\n\n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n\n\n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to  dissolve.\n\n\n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n\n\n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing  out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,  thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf  at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n\n\n And then he said softly:\n\n\n \" One hundred. \" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich of the following is not a reason why Burnett kills Kriere?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He views Kriere as being responsible for the war\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He needs more bodies to fill the ship\u2019s morgue to fulfill his mission\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He needs more bodies to fill the ship\u2019s morgue to fulfill his mission\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Statement:\n\nI argue that Burnett\u2019s motive for killing Kriere is not ideological blame for the war, but purely practical: he needs that one last body to \u201cfill the ship\u2019s morgue\u201d and complete his final cargo. Debater_A\u2019s claim\u2014that Burnett viewed Kriere as responsible for the war\u2014is unfounded. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Burnett\u2019s Obsession with \u201cFilling the Shelves.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Throughout the story, Burnett is consumed by the need to keep his morgue ship fully loaded. He\u2019s haunted by \u201cshelves filling up all too quickly\u201d (background text) and repeatedly reminds Rice that they must return to Earth with a full cargo.  \n   \u2022 In his final moments, Burnett mourns that \u201cwe haven\u2019t got a full cargo, boy,\u201d and frets that \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be right\u201d to sail back with an unfilled slot. He fixes on the empty shelf at slot 100 as the only thing that matters. That urgency drives his decision to scoop up and crush Kriere.  \n\n2. Burnett\u2019s Detachment from the War\u2019s Ideology.  \n   \u2022 Burnett has spent ten years mechanically retrieving corpses; he is \u201cstarved for life\u201d and bitter about war, not ideologically committed to one side. He describes corpses as \u201cmag\u00adgots eating\u201d at him, not as symbolic agents of some cause.  \n   \u2022 When Rice points out Lethla\u2019s identity and the opportunity to thwart Venusian power, Burnett shrugs it off: \u201cTalk about bodies and rulers to someone else.\u201d His sole preoccupation is the routine of shipping bodies, not high-minded justice.  \n\n3. The Act Is Calculated to Secure the Final Cargo Slot.  \n   \u2022 When Lethla frees himself and seizes the ship, Burnett does not hesitate to activate the star-port claw on Kriere\u2014his only thought is \u201cthe claw glided toward Kriere\u201d\u2014and he calmly explains: \u201cOnly dead men come aboard the Constellation\u2026 I believe it.\u201d  \n   \u2022 This is not an impulsive act of vengeance; it is a cold, professional maneuver to seize exactly one corpse\u2014the one needed to complete the inventory.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Claim:  \nDebater_A asserts Burnett killed Kriere because he saw him as \u201cresponsible for the war.\u201d But the text contains no hint that Burnett holds Kriere personally culpable. He never mentions Kriere\u2019s crimes or any moral judgment against Venusian leadership. Instead, Burnett is visibly exhausted by the unending drudgery of corpse-retrieval: \u201cTen years of it\u2026 this would be his last trip.\u201d That overwhelming fatigue explains why he\u2019ll do anything\u2014including murdering a living man\u2014to avoid returning with an incomplete cargo.  \n\nTherefore, the one thing Burnett is definitely not doing is punishing Kriere for causing the war. The story makes clear his motive is entirely the practical necessity of filling the ship\u2019s morgue. The correct answer is that Burnett kills Kriere because he needs more bodies to fulfill his mission, not because he views Kriere as responsible for the war.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that Burnett\u2019s motive in crushing Kriere wasn\u2019t personal or political but simply logistical\u2014a craven desire to \u201cneed more bodies to fill the ship\u2019s morgue to fulfill his mission.\u201d That interpretation, however, collapses under a close reading of Bradbury\u2019s text. In fact, Burnett\u2019s action is driven by a far more profound motive: the hope that by killing Kriere\u2014\u201cthe All-Mighty\u201d whose command has perpetuated a galaxy-wide slaughter\u2014he might finally end the war that has cost him ten years of hauling corpse-cargo.\n\n1. Burnett\u2019s decade-long horror at his own role makes it impossible that he would coldly seize any convenient body simply to top off his shelves. As he laments earlier:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cTen years of it.\u2026 You came out empty and you went back full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn\u2019t laugh or talk or smoke\u2026 waiting for a decent burial.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   Burnett is clearly tormented, not casually indifferent. He doesn\u2019t simply need more bodies\u2014he needs the war to end.\n\n2. The climactic moment confirms his true motive. He doesn\u2019t wring his hands over an unfilled shelf; instead he seizes the one man whose death alone can alter galactic history. Bradbury writes:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cKriere loomed bigger\u2026 Kriere, the All-Mighty\u2026 At whose behest all space had quivered\u2026 Kriere would make odds impossible.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   Burnett\u2019s decision is a strategic assassination, not a cargo-maximization.\n\n3. And his own words tie the kill directly to ending the conflict. In the heat of the trap, he reflects:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cCapture Kriere and end the war, the end of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors\u2026 this would be the last trip!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   His goal is explicitly to end the war\u2014i.e., to stop filling shelves\u2014by removing its architect.\n\n4. Finally, after Kriere is crushed, Burnett\u2019s emotional release points beyond mere logistics. He laughs for minutes, not in triumph at a completed manifest, but in relief at the prospect of liberation from his grisly round:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cI said this was my last trip\u2014and I meant it. \u2026 Kind of nice to think of all those kids who\u2019ll never have to come aboard the Constellation\u2026 though, the way we used to\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   If his motive were simply to fill one more slot, this bitter catharsis would make no sense. It arises from his belief that Kriere\u2019s death will spare countless future victims.\n\nBy contrast, Debater_B\u2019s \u201cfilling the morgue\u201d thesis ignores the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on Burnett\u2019s moral exhaustion and his explicit understanding of Kriere as the puppet-master of the war. There is no sign that he covets any corpse in particular for mere arithmetic; he targets Kriere because he is responsible for countless deaths\u2014and by killing him, Burnett hopes to end that cycle once and for all. Thus the correct answer is that Burnett kills Kriere because he views Kriere as being responsible for the war.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He needs more bodies to fill the ship\u2019s morgue to fulfill his mission\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The story makes clear his motive is entirely the practical necessity of filling the ship\u2019s morgue. The correct answer is that Burnett kills Kriere because he needs more bodies to fulfill his mission, not because he views Kriere as responsible for the war.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s \u201cjust one more corpse\u201d argument falls apart the moment you look at Burnett\u2019s own words and actions in context. Far from slapping Kriere into the claw out of pure logistical panic, Burnett deliberately plans a coup de gr\u00e2ce against the man he knows \u201chas quivered all space\u201d\u2009\u2014\u2009because only Kriere\u2019s death can halt the slaughter.  \n\n1.   Burnett\u2019s stated goal is to \u201cend the war,\u201d not to \u201cfill the ship.\u201d  \n     \u2022  As he grips the controls, Bradbury tells us Burnett\u2019s thoughts directly:  \n        \u201cCapture Kriere and end the war, the end of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors\u2026 this would be the last trip!\u201d  That is not the mutter of a man fretting over manifest numbers; it is the cry of a man resolved to strike at the heart of the conflict.  \n     \u2022  If his motive were charting a full cargo, he would have seized any convenient body earlier\u2014yet he only activates the claw when Kriere, \u201cthe All-Mighty\u2026 whose command has perpetuated a galaxy-wide slaughter,\u201d drifts into reach.  \n\n2.   Burnett frames Kriere as uniquely culpable.  \n     \u2022  Bradbury repeatedly underscores Kriere\u2019s singular status: \u201cKriere, the All-Mighty\u2026 At whose behest all space had quivered.\u201d Burnett\u2019s decision to crush that specific man is a moral act, not an administrative one.  \n     \u2022  There is no parallel language of \u201cneed,\u201d \u201cmust,\u201d or \u201cincomplete cargo\u201d at the moment he makes his move\u2014only the recognition that by seizing Kriere he \u201cmight finally end the war that has cost him ten years of hauling corpse-cargo.\u201d  \n\n3.   The \u201cempty shelf\u201d worry only surfaces after Burnett\u2019s deed.  \n     \u2022  Debater_B points to Rice\u2019s fretting that \u201cwe haven\u2019t got a full cargo.\u201d But notice: Rice alone voices the shelf concern post\u2013kill. Burnett never joins him in panic about manifest space; in fact, right after trapping Kriere he laughs\u2014a release born of hope that the war will finally stop, not of relief at ticking off shelf #100.  \n     \u2022  Burnett\u2019s last murmured words\u2014\u201cKind of nice to think of all those kids who\u2019ll never have to come aboard the Constellation\u201d\u2014utterly refute any notion that he killed Kriere for shipping efficiency. His joy is in the prospect of sparing future victims.  \n\n4.   Burnett\u2019s actions throughout the story show growing moral urgency, not mounting logistical stress.  \n     \u2022  Earlier, he\u2019s haunted by \u201cten years\u2026 starved for life,\u201d \u201chating his job,\u201d \u201cyou never catch up with the war.\u201d This existential torment primes him to seize any chance to stop it.  \n     \u2022  He shrugs off every routine recovery\u2014\u201cTalk about bodies and rulers to someone else\u201d\u2014until the moment Kriere appears. Only then does he spring into decisive action aimed squarely at the war\u2019s architect.  \n\nIn contrast, the \u201cfill-the-last-slot\u201d theory forces us to ignore Burnett\u2019s explicit insistence that Kriere\u2019s death will end the slaughter. It reduces a moment of moral reckoning to clerical bookkeeping. Bradbury gives us a clear, repeated theme: Burnett kills Kriere because he is the single figure most responsible for a war that has dehumanized Burnett\u2019s life\u2014and by removing Kriere, Burnett believes he can finally halt the carnage. That, and not mere morgue-management, is why Burnett kills Kriere.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nFirst, let me be clear: nothing in Bradbury\u2019s text ever shows Burnett killing Kriere out of a sense of \u201crighting the galaxy\u201d by slaying its leader. All the concrete evidence points the opposite way\u2014Burnett\u2019s motive is purely to complete his final cargo manifest. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cend the war\u201d theory depends on misreadings and non-existent proclamations. I\u2019ll show why every one of Debater_A\u2019s points is mistaken, and why the **only** coherent reason for Burnett\u2019s act is to \u201cfill the ship\u2019s morgue.\u201d\n\n1. Debater_A misquotes and misattributes key lines.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A surrounds invented text with <invalid_quote> tags: these lines do **not** appear in the story. For instance, there is no passage reading, \u201cCapture Kriere and end the war, the end of shelves stacked\u2026\u201d in Burnett\u2019s own words. That line is a *narrator\u2019s summary* of Burnett\u2019s fleeting thought that capturing Kriere *might* end the war\u2014but it\u2019s immediately eclipsed by his obsessions with the morgue manifest. Debater_A has elevated narrative summary into \u201cevidence\u201d of a personal crusade, which Bradbury never provides.  \n\n2. Burnett\u2019s overriding obsession is filling that last slot\u2014100.  \n   \u2022 From the moment Rice reminds him \u201cTwo more pick-ups and back to New York,\u201d Burnett never stops counting bodies. He \u201ckept thinking the one thing he couldn\u2019t forget\u2026 You came along empty and you went back full-cargoed\u201d and, in his dying moments, groans \u201cwe haven\u2019t got a full cargo, boy\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d  \n   \u2022 When Lethla and Kriere threaten his routine, Burnett doesn\u2019t pause to weigh the political repercussions: he immediately pivots to \u201conly dead men come aboard the Constellation\u2026 I believe it,\u201d and jerks the claw into action. That chilling line makes sense only if his motive is manifest completion.  \n\n3. No moral judgment is ever uttered against Kriere.  \n   \u2022 Burnett never denounces Kriere, never cites him as \u201cresponsible for the war,\u201d and never expresses relief at seizing the war-lord. He doesn\u2019t even react verbally when Kriere appears\u2014he merely sees \u201ctwo shelves numbered and empty,\u201d and fixes on them. That fixation is the axis of his decision.  \n   \u2022 If Burnett\u2019s motive were ideological assassination, he\u2019d have hesitated, gloated, or spelled out Kriere\u2019s crimes. Instead, his act is swift, silent, clinical\u2014exactly like every other corpse retrieval he\u2019s done for ten years.  \n\n4. The final image proves it\u2019s about cargo, not crusade.  \n   \u2022 After he\u2019s mortally wounded, Burnett\u2019s last coherent words are, \u201cWe haven\u2019t got a full cargo\u2026 but still not full. If we went back\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d Even on the verge of death, his mind is on manifest arithmetic, not \u201cglory\u201d or \u201cending the war.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Rice\u2019s final line\u2014\u201cOne hundred\u201d\u2014confirms that, for both men, the ship\u2019s manifest was the only metric that ever mattered.  \n\nIn sum, Debater_A\u2019s insistence that Burnett kills Kriere to halt the war is a chimera. Bradbury never gives Burnett a single line of dialogue or reflection that equates Kriere\u2019s death with peace. Instead, from first to last, Burnett is driven by a grim compulsion to \u201cfill the shelves,\u201d to \u201chave one hundred,\u201d and to avoid returning with an unfilled slot.
