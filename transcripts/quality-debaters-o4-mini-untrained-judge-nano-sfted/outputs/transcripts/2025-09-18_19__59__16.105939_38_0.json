    "background_text": "Diamonds in the Rough \n\n         Fourscore and seven years ago, the first steel and concrete baseball palace opened for business. Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n",

These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the golden age parks compare to the older parks?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The newer ones were less hazardous\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The older ones were more intimate\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The older ones were more intimate\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The older ones were more intimate\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million.

Actual Size Comparisons  \n   \u2022 Ebbets Field (golden age): 5.7 acres, 32,000 seats  \n   \u2022 Kingdome (\u201976 multipurpose): 9.3 acres, 58,000 seats  \n   \u2022 Ballpark at Arlington (modern \u201cretro\u201d): 13.6 acres, 49,100 seats  \n   The author\u2019s explicit conclusion: \u201c<quote>in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate.</quote>\u201d By direct contrast, the golden-age parks sat fans much tighter to the field.  \n2. Proximity to the Action  \n   \u2022 Tiger Stadium upper deck: 125 feet from batter  \n   \u2022 Arlington upper deck: 224 feet from batter  \n   The text attributes this retreat to \u201cplacing the columns behind the seating areas\u201d and adding luxury tiers\u2014none of which has anything to do with safety but everything to do with intimacy.  \n3. Subjective Feel  \n   \u2022 The author praises \u201cexposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings\u201d for creating convincing forms, attractive materials, and an intimate sense of scale.  \n   \u2022 Even Camden Yards, designed to revive golden-age character, had to press for deck-lowering \u201cabout eight rows closer than Arlington\u2019s\u201d to recapture intimacy.  \n\nIII. Why \u201cLess Hazardous\u201d Fails as the Defining Comparison  \n1. Peripheral Mention vs. Sustained Analysis  \n   \u2022 Fire safety is one word in a four-part list.

The Question Asks \u201cHow Did the Golden Age Parks Compare to the Older Parks?\u201d  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s answer is clearly about fan experience: scale, sightlines, neighborhood character. Safety, while beneficial, is not presented as the golden-age parks\u2019 signature legacy\u2014intimacy is.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nDebater_B\u2019s safety argument seizes on a single clause, but the essay\u2019s core argument\u2014and every detailed comparison\u2014revolves around how much more intimate the golden-age steel-and-concrete parks were than their wooden predecessors. Therefore, the correct answer is that the older, golden-age parks were more intimate.",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the golden age parks compare to the older parks?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The newer ones were less hazardous\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The older ones were more intimate\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The older ones were more intimate\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLess Hazardous\u201d Claim  \n1. Misreads the question\u2019s focus. The debate asks how golden-age parks compared to the older wooden parks, not whether they were safer. Debater_B\u2019s emphasis on fire safety (<quote>Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size,</quote>) misses that we\u2019re comparing fan experience, not construction risk.  \n2. Overlooks trade-offs. Yes, steel-and-concrete parks reduced fire risk. But they did so at the expense of the qualities most treasured by fans\u2014namely, intimacy and close-up viewing. Safety alone does not answer how they compared in terms of atmosphere.  \n3. Ignores the author\u2019s central praise of intimacy. The text continually measures parks by their scale and fan proximity, e.g.:  \n   \u2022 <quote> Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. </quote>  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThese parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks \u2026 far larger than the parks they claim to emulate.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \nDebater_B\u2019s focus on hazard is peripheral to the argument the author actually develops.\n\nII. The Golden-Age Parks Were More Intimate  \n1. Actual Size: Golden-age parks occupied far less land, seating fewer fans closer together.  \n   \u2013 Ebbets Field: 5.7 acres, 32,000 seats  \n   \u2013 Ballpark at Arlington: 13.6 acres, 49,100 seats  \n   \u2013 Kingdome (\u201976): 9.3 acres, 58,000 seats  \n   The author demonstrates that \u201cnew ballyards are not intimate\u201d in actual size, outpacing both golden-age and mid-century multipurpose stadiums.  \n2. Proximity to the Game: Upper decks in the old parks were much closer.  \n   \u2013 Tiger Stadium: 125 feet from batter to middle-row upper-deck  \n   \u2013 Arlington: 224 feet\u2014the new park\u2019s decks sit almost 100 feet farther back.  \n   The text attributes this to sprawling amenities and relocated support columns:  \n     <quote>placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back</quote>  \n3. Subjective Perception of Intimacy: The golden-age parks\u2019 tight sightlines and distinctive asymmetries gave fans a sense of being \u201cin the game.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Exposed brick, steelwork, and irregular field dimensions contributed to a cozy, neighborhood feel.  \n   \u2013 Baltimore\u2019s Camden Yards mimicked this intimacy, but even then had to fight to lower its decks <quote> about eight rows closer than Arlington's. </quote>  \n4. Authorial Emphasis: The essay laments that contemporary parks \u201clack the character of the classic parks\u201d and repeatedly returns to intimacy as the yardstick of success:  \n   \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cA good architect can ace the second part \u2026 The exposed steelwork, brick, stone \u2026 beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 Yet, \u201cin actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate.\u201d  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe author contrasts golden-age parks with both postwar multipurposes and modern replicas, always returning to size and proximity. Their chief virtue is intimacy\u2014both physical closeness and the psychological sense of shared experience\u2014which Debater_B\u2019s safety argument neither addresses nor undermines. Therefore, the correct answer is indisputably that the older, golden-age parks were more intimate.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cmore intimate\u201d claim  \n1. Misreads the question\u2019s focus on safety: The prompt asks \u201cHow did the golden age parks compare to the older parks?\u201d That is asking for a distinguishing characteristic\u2014Debater_A\u2019s intimacy argument answers a different question about fan experience, not about what set those parks apart from their wooden predecessors.  \n2. Ignores the text\u2019s explicit contrast on hazard: The background states that replacing wooden parks, the steel-and-concrete ballparks  set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience.  Debater_A cherry-picks \u201cintimacy\u201d while omitting \u201cfire safety,\u201d the very characteristic that distinguished the golden-age parks from the older wooden ones.  \n\nII. Arguments for \u201cless hazardous\u201d as the correct answer  \n1. Golden\u2010age parks were constructed of steel and concrete, dramatically reducing fire risk.  \n   \u2022 Background: They \u201creplacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for \u2026 fire safety.\u201d <quote> Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. </quote>  \n   \u2022 Evidence: Wooden grandstands were notoriously prone to fires and structural decay; steel and concrete virtually eliminated those hazards.  \n\n2. The key innovation distinguishing golden-age parks from their predecessors was safety, not subjective intimacy.  \n   \u2022 Fire hazards in wooden parks threatened fan well-being and stadium longevity; this was a life-and-death upgrade.  \n   \u2022 By contrast, intimacy remains a design choice, not a necessary improvement over wooden structures.  \n\n3. Other improvements (size, convenience) support, but do not override, the primacy of hazard reduction.  \n   \u2022 The text leads with \u201csize, fire safety\u2026\u201d\u2014fire safety is elevated above convenience or aesthetics. <quote> set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. </quote>  \n   \u2022 A stadium\u2019s foundational purpose is to shelter spectators safely; hence, reduced hazard is the most salient comparison.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s emphasis on intimacy misinterprets the core distinction highlighted in the background text. The defining advancement of golden-age parks over the older wooden parks was their dramatically improved fire safety and structural resilience. Therefore, \u201cThe newer ones were less hazardous\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The older ones were more intimate\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the golden age parks compare to the older parks?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The older ones were more intimate\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The newer ones were less hazardous\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The newer ones were less hazardous\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cmore intimate\u201d claim  \n1. Misreads the question\u2019s focus on safety: The prompt asks \u201cHow did the golden age parks compare to the older parks?\u201d That is asking for a distinguishing characteristic\u2014Debater_A\u2019s intimacy argument answers a different question about fan experience, not about what set those parks apart from their wooden predecessors.  \n2. Ignores the text\u2019s explicit contrast on hazard: The background states that replacing wooden parks, the steel-and-concrete ballparks  set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience.  Debater_A cherry-picks \u201cintimacy\u201d while omitting \u201cfire safety,\u201d the very characteristic that distinguished the golden-age parks from the older wooden ones.  \n\nII. Arguments for \u201cless hazardous\u201d as the correct answer  \n1. Golden\u2010age parks were constructed of steel and concrete, dramatically reducing fire risk.  \n   \u2022 Background: They \u201creplacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for \u2026 fire safety.\u201d <quote> Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. </quote>  \n   \u2022 Evidence: Wooden grandstands were notoriously prone to fires and structural decay; steel and concrete virtually eliminated those hazards.  \n\n2. The key innovation distinguishing golden-age parks from their predecessors was safety, not subjective intimacy.  \n   \u2022 Fire hazards in wooden parks threatened fan well-being and stadium longevity; this was a life-and-death upgrade.  \n   \u2022 By contrast, intimacy remains a design choice, not a necessary improvement over wooden structures.  \n\n3. Other improvements (size, convenience) support, but do not override, the primacy of hazard reduction.  \n   \u2022 The text leads with \u201csize, fire safety\u2026\u201d\u2014fire safety is elevated above convenience or aesthetics. <quote> set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. </quote>  \n   \u2022 A stadium\u2019s foundational purpose is to shelter spectators safely; hence, reduced hazard is the most salient comparison.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s emphasis on intimacy misinterprets the core distinction highlighted in the background text. The defining advancement of golden-age parks over the older wooden parks was their dramatically improved fire safety and structural resilience. Therefore, \u201cThe newer ones were less hazardous\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLess Hazardous\u201d Claim  \n1. Misreads the question\u2019s focus. The debate asks how golden-age parks compared to the older wooden parks, not whether they were safer. Debater_B\u2019s emphasis on fire safety (<quote>Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size,</quote>) misses that we\u2019re comparing fan experience, not construction risk.  \n2. Overlooks trade-offs. Yes, steel-and-concrete parks reduced fire risk. But they did so at the expense of the qualities most treasured by fans\u2014namely, intimacy and close-up viewing. Safety alone does not answer how they compared in terms of atmosphere.  \n3. Ignores the author\u2019s central praise of intimacy. The text continually measures parks by their scale and fan proximity, e.g.:  \n   \u2022 <quote> Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. </quote>  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThese parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks \u2026 far larger than the parks they claim to emulate.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \nDebater_B\u2019s focus on hazard is peripheral to the argument the author actually develops.\n\nII. The Golden-Age Parks Were More Intimate  \n1. Actual Size: Golden-age parks occupied far less land, seating fewer fans closer together.  \n   \u2013 Ebbets Field: 5.7 acres, 32,000 seats  \n   \u2013 Ballpark at Arlington: 13.6 acres, 49,100 seats  \n   \u2013 Kingdome (\u201976): 9.3 acres, 58,000 seats  \n   The author demonstrates that \u201cnew ballyards are not intimate\u201d in actual size, outpacing both golden-age and mid-century multipurpose stadiums.  \n2. Proximity to the Game: Upper decks in the old parks were much closer.  \n   \u2013 Tiger Stadium: 125 feet from batter to middle-row upper-deck  \n   \u2013 Arlington: 224 feet\u2014the new park\u2019s decks sit almost 100 feet farther back.  \n   The text attributes this to sprawling amenities and relocated support columns:  \n     <quote>placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back</quote>  \n3. Subjective Perception of Intimacy: The golden-age parks\u2019 tight sightlines and distinctive asymmetries gave fans a sense of being \u201cin the game.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Exposed brick, steelwork, and irregular field dimensions contributed to a cozy, neighborhood feel.  \n   \u2013 Baltimore\u2019s Camden Yards mimicked this intimacy, but even then had to fight to lower its decks <quote> about eight rows closer than Arlington's. </quote>  \n4. Authorial Emphasis: The essay laments that contemporary parks \u201clack the character of the classic parks\u201d and repeatedly returns to intimacy as the yardstick of success:  \n   \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cA good architect can ace the second part \u2026 The exposed steelwork, brick, stone \u2026 beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 Yet, \u201cin actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate.\u201d  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe author contrasts golden-age parks with both postwar multipurposes and modern replicas, always returning to size and proximity. Their chief virtue is intimacy\u2014both physical closeness and the psychological sense of shared experience\u2014which Debater_B\u2019s safety argument neither addresses nor undermines.

Golden\u2010age parks were constructed of steel and concrete, dramatically reducing fire risk.  \n   \u2022 Background: They \u201creplacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for \u2026 fire safety.\u201d <quote> Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. </quote>  \n   \u2022 Evidence: Wooden grandstands were notoriously prone to fires and structural decay; steel and concrete virtually eliminated those hazards.  \n\n2. The key innovation distinguishing golden-age parks from their predecessors was safety, not subjective intimacy.  \n   \u2022 Fire hazards in wooden parks threatened fan well-being and stadium longevity; this was a life-and-death upgrade.  \n   \u2022 By contrast, intimacy remains a design choice, not a necessary improvement over wooden structures.  \n\n3. Other improvements (size, convenience) support, but do not override, the primacy of hazard reduction.  \n   \u2022 The text leads with \u201csize, fire safety\u2026\u201d\u2014fire safety is elevated above convenience or aesthetics. <quote> set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. </quote>  \n   \u2022 A stadium\u2019s foundational purpose is to shelter spectators safely; hence, reduced hazard is the most salient comparison.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s emphasis on intimacy misinterprets the core distinction highlighted in the background text. The defining advancement of golden-age parks over the older wooden parks was their dramatically improved fire safety and structural resilience. Therefore, \u201cThe newer ones were less hazardous\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_B Misreads the Author\u2019s Emphasis  \n1. The text does mention fire safety\u2014\u201c<quote>Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience.</quote>\u201d\u2014but that opening list is merely an overview. Fire safety is not what the author spends the next ten blocks of text analyzing.  \n2. The essay\u2019s sustained focus is on intimacy\u2014both \u201cactual size and the subjective perception of size and scale.\u201d Fire safety is never revisited. By contrast, every detailed comparison (acreage, seat distance, materials, proportions) centers on closeness and scale, not hazard reduction.  \n\nII. The Author\u2019s Central Metric Is Intimacy, Not Safety  \n1. Actual Size Comparisons  \n   \u2022 Ebbets Field (golden age): 5.7 acres, 32,000 seats  \n   \u2022 Kingdome (\u201976 multipurpose): 9.3 acres, 58,000 seats  \n   \u2022 Ballpark at Arlington (modern \u201cretro\u201d): 13.6 acres, 49,100 seats  \n   The author\u2019s explicit conclusion: \u201c<quote>in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate.</quote>\u201d By direct contrast, the golden-age parks sat fans much tighter to the field.  \n2. Proximity to the Action  \n   \u2022 Tiger Stadium upper deck: 125 feet from batter  \n   \u2022 Arlington upper deck: 224 feet from batter  \n   The text attributes this retreat to \u201cplacing the columns behind the seating areas\u201d and adding luxury tiers\u2014none of which has anything to do with safety but everything to do with intimacy.  \n3. Subjective Feel  \n   \u2022 The author praises \u201cexposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings\u201d for creating convincing forms, attractive materials, and an intimate sense of scale.  \n   \u2022 Even Camden Yards, designed to revive golden-age character, had to press for deck-lowering \u201cabout eight rows closer than Arlington\u2019s\u201d to recapture intimacy.  \n\nIII. Why \u201cLess Hazardous\u201d Fails as the Defining Comparison  \n1. Peripheral Mention vs. Sustained Analysis  \n   \u2022 Fire safety is one word in a four-part list. Intimacy is the lens through which the entire essay is written.  \n2. The Question Asks \u201cHow Did the Golden Age Parks Compare to the Older Parks?\u201d  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s answer is clearly about fan experience: scale, sightlines, neighborhood character. Safety, while beneficial, is not presented as the golden-age parks\u2019 signature legacy\u2014intimacy is.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nDebater_B\u2019s safety argument seizes on a single clause, but the essay\u2019s core argument\u2014and every detailed comparison\u2014revolves around how much more intimate the golden-age steel-and-concrete parks were than their wooden predecessors. Therefore, the correct answer is that the older, golden-age parks were more intimate.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A Misreads the Core Comparison  \n1. The question asks how golden-age parks compared to the older wooden ones, not how they compared to today\u2019s multipurpose stadiums. It\u2019s a direct apples-to-apples contrast between steel-and-concrete \u201cgolden age\u201d parks and the wooden predecessors.  \n2. Debater_A seizes on intimacy\u2014a subjective spectator experience\u2014yet the text explicitly highlights hazard reduction as the foundational improvement:  \n   <quote> Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. </quote>  \n   Fire safety isn\u2019t an incidental afterthought; it\u2019s right after size in the list of breakthroughs, underscoring its primacy.  \n\nII. Steel and Concrete Parks Were Objectively Safer  \n1. Virtually Eliminated Fire Risk  \n   \u2022 Wooden grandstands routinely suffered devastating fires (e.g., the 1911 fire at Detroit\u2019s Bennett Park).  \n   \u2022 By building in steel and concrete, the golden-age parks \u201cset new standards for \u2026 fire safety,\u201d protecting both spectators and team assets.  \n2. Structural Resilience and Longevity  \n   \u2022 Concrete-and-steel ballyards resisted rot, weather damage, and spontaneous collapse\u2014hazards intrinsic to wood.  \n   \u2022 Longer service life meant fewer catastrophic failures and less frequent rebuilds, a direct financial and safety gain.  \n\nIII. Intimacy Was Important\u2014but Secondary  \n1. Intimacy Can Be Replicated; Hazard Reduction Cannot  \n   \u2022 Modern parks (e.g., Camden Yards and its successors) consciously mimic the \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d forms and exposed brickwork to produce intimacy.  \n   \u2022 No amount of design can make a wooden structure as noncombustible or resistant to decay as steel and concrete.  \n2. The Text Puts Safety Before Aesthetics  \n   \u2022 By listing \u201cfire safety\u201d immediately after \u201csize,\u201d the author marks it as a defining feature, not a footnote.  \n   \u2022 Subsequent praise of intimacy applies to comparisons among steel-and-concrete parks, not to wooden predecessors.  \n\nIV. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIntimacy\u201d Argument Fails  \n1. Cherry-picks Later Sections: Debater_A cites intimacy comparisons between modern parks and mid-century multipurpose stadiums\u2014irrelevant to the wooden-vs-early-steel debate.  \n2. Overlooks that intimacy suffered in early steel parks too: the text complains that postwar multipurpose parks \u201clack the character of the classic parks,\u201d but that\u2019s about form, not about hazard.  \n3. Even golden-age steel parks were less intimate than some wooden ones (columns within seating), yet we still call them an improvement because safety outweighed any loss of intimacy.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s focus on subjective seat proximity distracts from the question: when you replaced wooden ballparks with steel and concrete, the single most transformative advance was safety. The golden-age parks were, above all, far less hazardous\u2014and that objective improvement is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
