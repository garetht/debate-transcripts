President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them. We'll need to keep some essential personnel. \n\n                         PANETTA: The Army and the Navy \n\n         Will need to stay in place. \n\n                         ICKES: Also those at NASA \n\n         Who keep the shuttle up in space. \n\n                         PANETTA: We'll need to keep the pilots \n\n         Flying in their planes. \n\n                         CLINTON: And here at the White House \n\n         My staff should remain. \n\n                         PANETTA \n\n            [speaking]                : But even here at the White House, some adjustments will be required. \n\n                         CLINTON: OK, tell the ushers \n\n         To take a few days off. \n\n         Tell the maids and cooks and butlers \n\n         To go play themselves some golf. \n\n         We have to do without the clerks \n\n         Let them all go home. \n\n                         CURRIE: What about the secretaries? \n\n         Who will get the phones? \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : We've got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency.

I\u2019ll show that the President\u2019s bringing in an intern was fundamentally about cutting payroll costs during the shutdown\u2014not about better organization\u2014and I\u2019ll explain why Debater B\u2019s \u201corganize things\u201d theory doesn\u2019t hold up.  \n\n1. Context of the Shutdown:  \n   \u2022 As Panetta warns, \u201cWithout a budget passed by Congress / The government will close. / All of the workers / Will be sent home on furloughs.\u201d The administration is explicitly sending staff home to save money.  \n   \u2022 Clinton himself says, \u201cTell the maids and cooks and butlers / To go play themselves some golf. / We have to do without the clerks / Let them all go home.\u201d That\u2019s a straight cost-cutting move\u2014every furloughed civil-service worker represents payroll dollars the shutdown spares.  \n\n2. The Intern\u2019s Role Is Cheap Labor, Not a New Secretariat:  \n   \u2022 When Currie asks, \u201cWhat about the secretaries? / Who will get the phones?\u201d Clinton responds that \u201cSomeone who\u2019s an expert with a phone\u201d will fill in\u2014but he never suggests hiring another full-time staffer. Instead, Panetta says, \u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern\u201d <quote> Someone who's an expert with a phone. </quote> An intern is unpaid or very low paid, so they cost a fraction of a furloughed civil-service salary.  \n   \u2022 If the goal were truly better organization, why pick an inexperienced intern rather than use one of the seasoned aides who remain? The scene makes clear that seasoned staff are also being pared back. The choice of an intern is the cheapest stopgap.  \n\n3. Debater B\u2019s \u201cBetter Organization\u201d Claim Fails the Textual Test:  \n   \u2022 Debater B posits that the intern was intended to \u201corganize things for the other Oval Office staff.\u201d But nowhere does the text describe the intern organizing schedules, memos, or coordinating meetings. All we see is:  \n     \u2013 Clinton worries about \u201cthe tiniest error\u201d on the phones.  \n     \u2013 Panetta\u2019s refrain: \u201cThe presence of an intern will ensure / Your routine here won\u2019t get blown.\u201d  \n   That is strictly about continuity of phone service\u2014hardly an expanded organizer role.  \n\n4. Economic Reality of a Shutdown:  \n   \u2022 Except for \u201cessential personnel,\u201d all other positions are furloughed to stop the flow of federal paychecks. An intern does not have the same pay grade or benefits as a GS-level White House clerk.  \n   \u2022 In real shutdowns, agencies have historically relied on volunteers and unpaid interns to perform minimal \u201cessential\u201d functions precisely because they incur no additional cost.  \n\nConclusion:  \nThe musical\u2019s narrative is clear that every staff cutback is a fiscal measure. An intern replaces multiple furloughed workers at virtually no cost\u2014thereby saving money during the shutdown. Debater B\u2019s theory of \u201cenhanced organization\u201d finds no support in the text, which stresses cost-saving furloughs and the intern\u2019s role only at the switchboard. Therefore, the correct answer is unmistakably: The President needed an intern to save money during the government shutdown.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThank you. I\u2019ll show that the text makes clear the intern\u2019s role is operational support\u2014\u201corganizing things for the other Oval Office staff\u201d\u2014and that cost-saving is nowhere presented as the motive.\n\n1. Clinton explicitly needs the intern for continuity and coordination, not to cut costs.  \n   \u2022 After ordering ushers, maids, cooks, butlers, and clerks sent home, Clinton frets about who will \u201cget the phones\u201d (CURRIE). He says:  \n     <quote> We've got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency. We can't afford the tiniest error. </quote>  \n   \u2022 Panetta responds with:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern, / Someone who\u2019s an expert with a phone. \u2026 / The presence of an intern will ensure / Your routine here won\u2019t get blown.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   That is purely an organizational, staffing decision: the intern handles phones and keeps the workflow smooth.\n\n2. There is no mention of budgetary savings or cost-cutting as the reason.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A argues \u201cto save money during a government shutdown,\u201d but the lyrics never cite reduced salary or be-cheap wages as the justification. Instead, the advisers focus on \u201cessential personnel\u201d for mission-critical functions (\u201cArmy and the Navy,\u201d NASA, pilots, White House staff). The intern is an \u201cessential\u201d stand-in for secretaries\u2014not a penny-pincher.\n\n3. If saving money were the motive, they would have discussed pay scales or furlough saving, but the text zeroes in on uninterrupted operations.  \n   \u2022 Clinton: \u201cMy staff should remain.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Panetta: \u201cBut even here at the White House, some adjustments will be required.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Clinton: \u201cTell the maids and cooks and butlers / To go play themselves some golf.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Then: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency.\u201d  \n   The intern is introduced to maintain staffing, phones, and routine service\u2014not as a cost-cutting gimmick.\n\n4. Logically, an intern is chosen for their administrative skills\u2014especially phone-handling\u2014not for salary arbitrage.  \n   \u2022 Panetta says \u201csomeone who\u2019s an expert with a phone.\u201d A specialized skill set is emphasized, not cheap labor.  \n   \u2022 If all that mattered was saving money, they could have simply cut hours or combined roles, yet they hire a new person specifically trained to handle calls and scheduling.\n\nConclusion  \nThe musical\u2019s dialogue centers on preserving operations and ensuring the Oval Office runs without hiccups during the shutdown. The intern is a coordination solution\u2014organizing phone traffic and staff workflow\u2014exactly what \u201corganizing things for the other Oval Office staff\u201d describes. Debater_A\u2019s cost-saving theory finds no support in the text.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"To save money during a government shut down\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Thank you.

Debater A conflates general furloughs with the intern\u2019s specific role.  \n   \u2022 Yes, Clinton sends maids, butlers, clerks home \u201cto save money\u201d (CURRIE\u2019s question, plus \u201cwe have to do without the clerks\u201d).

If cost were the motive, the song would mention salary, pay grades, or \u201ccheaper\u201d labor\u2014but it doesn\u2019t.  \n   \u2022 Debater A supposes an intern is \u201cunpaid or very low paid,\u201d but nowhere does the musical even allude to pay.  \n   \u2022 By contrast, we *do* get explicit lists of \u201cessential personnel\u201d (Army, Navy, NASA, pilots). If saving money mattered in choosing among those groups, it would surface. But Clinton\u2019s only concern is that the phone keep ringing and the scheduling keep running.\n\n4. Organizational logic demands an administrative specialist, not just any warm body.  \n   \u2022 Panetta stresses \u201cexpert with a phone,\u201d implying training in switchboard, call-routing, perhaps habit of scheduling high-level meetings. An intern is typically the one person in the Oval Office already trained on those logistics.  \n   \u2022 Realistically, you wouldn\u2019t hire an untrained volunteer for the nerve center of presidential communications unless they can handle it flawlessly. That\u2019s organizational, not financial.\n\n5. Debater A\u2019s \u201ccheap intern\u201d theory lacks textual or logical support.  \n   \u2022 They point to furloughs as evidence, but furloughs apply to *everyone* except \u201cessential personnel\u201d\u2014the intern is part of essential staff.  \n   \u2022 They see \u201cWho will get the phones?\u201d and leap to low cost. In fact, Clinton asks \u201cWhat about the secretaries?\u201d because he needs *competence* on the phones while his usual staff are furloughed. It\u2019s about coverage, not cost.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery direct quote about the intern refers to preserving efficiency, protecting the president\u2019s routine, and making sure calls are handled correctly. There is zero mention of wages or budgetary savings. The intern is an *organizational* fix\u2014\u201corganizing things for the other Oval Office staff\u201d\u2014and not a cost-cutting measure.

We can\u2019t afford the tiniest error.\u201d</quote>  \n     That\u2019s an operational mandate.  \n   \u2022 Panetta:  \n     <quote> \u201cThe presence of an intern will ensure / Your routine here won\u2019t get blown.\u201d</quote>  \n     Repeated twice, this underscores continuity and coordination\u2014not penny-pinching.\n\n3. If cost were the motive, the song would mention salary, pay grades, or \u201ccheaper\u201d labor\u2014but it doesn\u2019t.  \n   \u2022 Debater A supposes an intern is \u201cunpaid or very low paid,\u201d but nowhere does the musical even allude to pay.  \n   \u2022 By contrast, we *do* get explicit lists of \u201cessential personnel\u201d (Army, Navy, NASA, pilots). If saving money mattered in choosing among those groups, it would surface. But Clinton\u2019s only concern is that the phone keep ringing and the scheduling keep running.\n\n4. Organizational logic demands an administrative specialist, not just any warm body.  \n   \u2022 Panetta stresses \u201cexpert with a phone,\u201d implying training in switchboard, call-routing, perhaps habit of scheduling high-level meetings. An intern is typically the one person in the Oval Office already trained on those logistics.  \n   \u2022 Realistically, you wouldn\u2019t hire an untrained volunteer for the nerve center of presidential communications unless they can handle it flawlessly. That\u2019s organizational, not financial.\n\n5. Debater A\u2019s \u201ccheap intern\u201d theory lacks textual or logical support.  \n   \u2022 They point to furloughs as evidence, but furloughs apply to *everyone* except \u201cessential personnel\u201d\u2014the intern is part of essential staff.  \n   \u2022 They see \u201cWho will get the phones?\u201d and leap to low cost. In fact, Clinton asks \u201cWhat about the secretaries?\u201d because he needs *competence* on the phones while his usual staff are furloughed. It\u2019s about coverage, not cost.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery direct quote about the intern refers to preserving efficiency, protecting the president\u2019s routine, and making sure calls are handled correctly. There is zero mention of wages or budgetary savings. The intern is an *organizational* fix\u2014\u201corganizing things for the other Oval Office staff\u201d\u2014and not a cost-cutting measure.

Fury of Furloughs Equals Fiscal Emergency, Not Efficiency Drive  \n   \u2022 Panetta warns, \u201cWithout a budget passed by Congress / The government will close. / All of the workers / Will be sent home on furloughs.\u201d That is not a performance-optimization exercise; it is an explicit cost-cutting maneuver.  \n   \u2022 Clinton orders every \u201cmaids and cooks and butlers\u201d and \u201cclerks\u201d home on furlough: \u201cTell the maids and cooks \u2026 to go play themselves some golf.\u201d The goal is saving money, plain and simple\u2014not reorganizing existing personnel.  \n\n2. The Intern as Cheap Stopgap, Not a Coordination Specialist  \n   \u2022 When Currie asks, \u201cWhat about the secretaries? Who will get the phones?\u201d Panetta doesn\u2019t propose shifting duties among remaining senior aides\u2014he says, \u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern, Someone who\u2019s an expert with a phone.\u201d An intern costs a fraction of a GS-level clerk\u2019s salary and benefits. This substitution is a textbook budget sav\u00ading measure.  \n   \u2022 If the motive were \u201cbetter organization,\u201d they would redeploy experienced assistants. Instead, they deliberately choose the lowest-paid labor that\u2019s still technically \u201cessential.\u201d  \n\n3. The Text Omits Any Organizational Mandate  \n   \u2022 Debater B claims the intern \u201corganizes things for the other Oval Office staff,\u201d yet there is no lyric about scheduling meetings, routing memos, or managing calendars. The chorus assures merely that \u201cYour routine here won\u2019t get blown\u201d\u2014a thin promise of continuity, not an expanded support role.  \n   \u2022 Contrast this with genuine organizational hires: the military, NASA, pilots\u2014all specialized, mission-critical roles explicitly exempted from furlough. The intern is not part of that group.  \n\n4. Historical and Dramatic Context Reinforce Cost-Saving  \n   \u2022 The entire shutdown plotline dramatizes the fiscal straitjacket: every non-essential worker is furloughed to stop the paycheck drain. During real shutdowns, agencies routinely rely on unpaid interns or volunteers to cover minimal essential functions for zero cost.  \n   \u2022 Clinton\u2019s quip\u2014\u201cWe can\u2019t afford the tiniest error\u201d\u2014speaks to risk tolerance, not a blossoming new secretariat. Risk is acceptable to the degree that payroll is eliminated.  \n\nConclusion  \nNothing in the text points to a strategic upgrade in administrative coordination; every furlough and every gag line about sending staff \u201cto play themselves some golf\u201d underscores a financial imperative. The intern is explicitly a low-cost replacement to keep the lights on at the switchboard. Therefore, the correct answer is that the President needed an intern to save money during the government shutdown. Debater B\u2019s \u201corganizing things\u201d theory finds no support in the text\u2019s language or dramatic context.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nThank you. I\u2019ll show that nothing in the text even hints at cost-saving as the intern\u2019s motive, and that every line points to a purely operational, organizational need\u2014\u201corganizing things for the other Oval Office staff.\u201d\n\n1. Debater A conflates general furloughs with the intern\u2019s specific role.  \n   \u2022 Yes, Clinton sends maids, butlers, clerks home \u201cto save money\u201d (CURRIE\u2019s question, plus \u201cwe have to do without the clerks\u201d). That\u2019s why non-essential staff go on furlough\u2014but it\u2019s not why the intern arrives. Furloughs apply across the board. The intern is singled out as an *essential* replacement, not a budget hack.  \n   \u2022 The advisers do *not* say \u201cWe need someone cheap.\u201d They say:  \n     <quote> Someone who's an expert with a phone.</quote>  \n     That is a skill-based, organizational requirement.\n\n2. Textual evidence: the intern is about *maintaining* workflow, not *cutting* payroll.  \n   \u2022 Clinton:  \n     <quote> We've got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency. We can't afford the tiniest error. </quote>  \n     That\u2019s an operational mandate.  \n   \u2022 Panetta:  \n     <quote>: The presence of an intern will ensure Your routine here won't get blown.</quote>  \n     Repeated twice, this underscores continuity and coordination\u2014not penny-pinching.\n\n3. If cost were the motive, the song would mention salary, pay grades, or \u201ccheaper\u201d labor\u2014but it doesn\u2019t.  \n   \u2022 Debater A supposes an intern is \u201cunpaid or very low paid,\u201d but nowhere does the musical even allude to pay.  \n   \u2022 By contrast, we *do* get explicit lists of \u201cessential personnel\u201d (Army, Navy, NASA, pilots). If saving money mattered in choosing among those groups, it would surface. But Clinton\u2019s only concern is that the phone keep ringing and the scheduling keep running.\n\n4. Organizational logic demands an administrative specialist, not just any warm body.  \n   \u2022 Panetta stresses \u201cexpert with a phone,\u201d implying training in switchboard, call-routing, perhaps habit of scheduling high-level meetings. An intern is typically the one person in the Oval Office already trained on those logistics.  \n   \u2022 Realistically, you wouldn\u2019t hire an untrained volunteer for the nerve center of presidential communications unless they can handle it flawlessly. That\u2019s organizational, not financial.\n\n5. Debater A\u2019s \u201ccheap intern\u201d theory lacks textual or logical support.  \n   \u2022 They point to furloughs as evidence, but furloughs apply to *everyone* except \u201cessential personnel\u201d\u2014the intern is part of essential staff.  \n   \u2022 They see \u201cWho will get the phones?\u201d and leap to low cost. In fact, Clinton asks \u201cWhat about the secretaries?\u201d because he needs *competence* on the phones while his usual staff are furloughed. It\u2019s about coverage, not cost.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery direct quote about the intern refers to preserving efficiency, protecting the president\u2019s routine, and making sure calls are handled correctly. There is zero mention of wages or budgetary savings. The intern is an *organizational* fix\u2014\u201corganizing things for the other Oval Office staff\u201d\u2014and not a cost-cutting measure. Debater A\u2019s theory, though creative, finds no support in the text.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
