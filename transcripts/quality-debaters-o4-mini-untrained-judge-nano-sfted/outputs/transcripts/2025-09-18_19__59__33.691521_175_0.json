The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n", "question": "The author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:", "first_debater_answer": "Multiple generations of humans over time", "second_debater_answer": "One generation of humans", "debate_identifier": "The Olympic Gene Pool_The author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become.

Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Summary of the Author\u2019s Argument  \n1. The author repeatedly downplays the impact of new training methods, shoes, nutrition, and other technological \u201ctinkering.\u201d He writes that these advances are \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d and that \u201csports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896.\u201d (Background)  \n2. Instead, he attributes the steady improvement in performances (four-minute miles, jumping, sprinting) to long-term demographic and environmental trends that unfold over many generations\u2014better nutrition, health care, larger, faster-maturing bodies, and a vastly expanded pool of potential athletes.  \n\nII. Why \u201cOne Generation\u201d Is Inconsistent with the Text  \n1. Innovations in training\u2014Debater_B\u2019s focus\u2014are confined to single generations and do not alter the underlying secular trends. Even the author\u2019s \u201ctrivial case\u201d of curing a fever with antibiotics affects only that runner\u2019s performance that day, not the entire population\u2019s progress over decades.  \n2. The author explicitly contrasts \u201ctechnology or training\u201d with the demographic patterns that \u201caffect us all.\u201d If training innovations drove records, then performances would plateau if training stopped advancing\u2014but he argues they would continue rising regardless.  \n\nIII. Evidence That Improvements Require Multiple Generations  \n1. Secular trends are defined as long-term modifications, not brief fluctuations. The author cites increases in average body size, earlier maturation (age of menarche falling by \u201cthree or four months per decade\u201d), and longer life expectancy\u2014all changes only visible over many decades.  \n   \u2022 \u201cSecular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.\u201d (Background)  \n   \u2022 \u201cGirls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche\u2026has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years.\u201d  \n2. Nutritional improvements and healthcare advances operate generation by generation: better-fed children grow into stronger adults, who in turn raise better-nourished children. This compound effect takes multiple generations to yield the dramatic rises in performance records.  \n3. The growth of the global middle class and the explosion of population widen the talent pool over time. Britain, once dominant, now wins fewer medals not because its training declined, but because more nations and healthier populations have joined the Olympics.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of Debater_B  \n1. Debater_B overstates the effectiveness of immediate training \u201cinnovations.\u201d While a new shoe or lactic-acid test might trim milliseconds off an individual\u2019s time, it cannot account for a mile-record drop from 4:00 to 3:44 over forty years. Only underlying physiological shifts across birth cohorts can.  \n2. If one generation\u2019s training were the key factor, improvements would track the release of new technologies. Instead, the record-setting curve remains smooth and continuous, mirroring gradual secular changes\u2014exactly what the author describes.  \n3. The author\u2019s comparison to race-horse breeding demonstrates that even purpose-built genetic selection quickly hits a biomechanical ceiling. Only long-term environmental enhancement has driven human records upward without plateau.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe author argues that athletic performances improve primarily because the human \u201cmachine\u201d itself is changing\u2014through nutrition, healthcare, maturation, and a growing athlete pool\u2014over multiple generations. He dismisses one-generation training advances as mere tinkering. Therefore, the innovations in athletic training have their greatest impact not on a single generation\u2019s records, but on the demographic evolution of athletes across many generations.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Summary of Positions  \nDebater A claims that innovations in athletic training exert their greatest influence cumulatively over multiple generations. I maintain instead that new training methods primarily boost performance within a single generation\u2014what coaches call the \u201cquick fix,\u201d not a multigenerational shift.\n\nII. Critique of Debater A\u2019s Argument  \n1. Conflation of Secular Trends and Training Effects  \n   a. Debater A repeatedly cites \u201csecular\u201d improvements\u2014better nutrition, healthcare, larger talent pools\u2014as evidence that training innovations change populations over decades (<quote> These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns </quote>). But these are exactly the points Berry uses to argue that training innovations are merely \u201ctinkering\u201d in any long-term sense.  \n   b. The background makes clear that secular trends\u2014improved diet, medical care, population growth\u2014are what drive multigenerational gains, not training. Training improvements, by contrast, would have produced only marginal, single-generation gains (<quote>Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they</quote>). Debater A\u2019s position flips the cause and effect.\n\n2. Lack of Evidence for Cumulative Genetic Change via Training  \n   a. Debater A implies that training innovations are inherited across generations. Yet exercises and regimens have no genetic or epigenetic mechanism for passing on improvements. Berry explicitly states that natural selection for athletic prowess ended long ago and that training probably reduces, not increases, athletes\u2019 reproductive success (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days \u2026 today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children than average\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Without a plausible heritable mechanism, you cannot attribute multigenerational improvement to training.  \n\nIII. Defense of One-Generation Impact  \n1. Immediate Physiological Adaptations  \n   a. New training techniques (e.g., altitude chambers, interval training) trigger acute physiological responses\u2014higher VO2 max, lactic-acid tolerance\u2014that manifest within months. These benefits vanish if the regimen is discontinued and cannot be passed on to offspring.  \n   b. Berry acknowledges that whether antibiotics cure an athlete\u2019s fever before a race is a trivial but direct one\u2010generation benefit (<quote>y, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race,</quote>). That\u2019s training/medical innovation acting in a single generation.\n\n2. Technological \u201cTinkering\u201d Yields Diminishing Returns Over Time  \n   a. If training innovations truly had multigenerational impact, we would see accelerating improvements in records. Instead, Berry points out that horses\u2014subject to the most intensive breeding and training\u2014have plateaued in speed (<quote> Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit.</quote>). Humans, with far less systematic genetic selection, show steady but decelerating gains largely attributable to environment, not evolving training methods.  \n   b. This plateau suggests that beyond a single\u2010generation performance bump, training innovations cannot generate long-term cumulative gains.\n\n3. Evidence from Controlled Training Studies  \n   a. Sports science routinely measures the impact of a training protocol on athletes over a season or two. Improvements are quantifiable in that cohort; there is no follow\u2010up study showing that a champion\u2019s children run faster because mom used a novel plyometric routine.  \n   b. Thus, training breakthroughs remain confined to the generation that directly employs them.\n\nIV.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Summary of Positions  \nDebater A claims that innovations in athletic training exert their greatest influence cumulatively over multiple generations. I maintain instead that new training methods primarily boost performance within a single generation\u2014what coaches call the \u201cquick fix,\u201d not a multigenerational shift.\n\nII. Critique of Debater A\u2019s Argument  \n1. Conflation of Secular Trends and Training Effects  \n   a. Debater A repeatedly cites \u201csecular\u201d improvements\u2014better nutrition, healthcare, larger talent pools\u2014as evidence that training innovations change populations over decades (<quote> These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns </quote>). But these are exactly the points Berry uses to argue that training innovations are merely \u201ctinkering\u201d in any long-term sense.  \n   b. The background makes clear that secular trends\u2014improved diet, medical care, population growth\u2014are what drive multigenerational gains, not training. Training improvements, by contrast, would have produced only marginal, single-generation gains (<quote>Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they</quote>). Debater A\u2019s position flips the cause and effect.\n\n2. Lack of Evidence for Cumulative Genetic Change via Training  \n   a. Debater A implies that training innovations are inherited across generations. Yet exercises and regimens have no genetic or epigenetic mechanism for passing on improvements. Berry explicitly states that natural selection for athletic prowess ended long ago and that training probably reduces, not increases, athletes\u2019 reproductive success (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days \u2026 today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children than average\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Without a plausible heritable mechanism, you cannot attribute multigenerational improvement to training.  \n\nIII. Defense of One-Generation Impact  \n1. Immediate Physiological Adaptations  \n   a. New training techniques (e.g., altitude chambers, interval training) trigger acute physiological responses\u2014higher VO2 max, lactic-acid tolerance\u2014that manifest within months. These benefits vanish if the regimen is discontinued and cannot be passed on to offspring.  \n   b. Berry acknowledges that whether antibiotics cure an athlete\u2019s fever before a race is a trivial but direct one\u2010generation benefit (<quote>y, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race,</quote>). That\u2019s training/medical innovation acting in a single generation.\n\n2. Technological \u201cTinkering\u201d Yields Diminishing Returns Over Time  \n   a. If training innovations truly had multigenerational impact, we would see accelerating improvements in records. Instead, Berry points out that horses\u2014subject to the most intensive breeding and training\u2014have plateaued in speed (<quote> Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit.</quote>). Humans, with far less systematic genetic selection, show steady but decelerating gains largely attributable to environment, not evolving training methods.  \n   b. This plateau suggests that beyond a single\u2010generation performance bump, training innovations cannot generate long-term cumulative gains.\n\n3. Evidence from Controlled Training Studies  \n   a. Sports science routinely measures the impact of a training protocol on athletes over a season or two. Improvements are quantifiable in that cohort; there is no follow\u2010up study showing that a champion\u2019s children run faster because mom used a novel plyometric routine.  \n   b. Thus, training breakthroughs remain confined to the generation that directly employs them.\n\nIV. Conclusion  \nInnovations in athletic training deliver measurable gains within the generation that adopts them\u2014but have no mechanism to propagate those gains genetically or epigenetically to subsequent generations. True multigenerational improvements arise from broad secular trends\u2014nutrition, healthcare, population size\u2014not from the latest training regimen. Therefore, the author believes training innovations most impact one generation of humans, not many over time.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Summary of the Author\u2019s Argument  \n1. The author repeatedly downplays the impact of new training methods, shoes, nutrition, and other technological \u201ctinkering.\u201d He writes that these advances are \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d and that \u201csports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896.\u201d (Background)  \n2. Instead, he attributes the steady improvement in performances (four-minute miles, jumping, sprinting) to long-term demographic and environmental trends that unfold over many generations\u2014better nutrition, health care, larger, faster-maturing bodies, and a vastly expanded pool of potential athletes.  \n\nII. Why \u201cOne Generation\u201d Is Inconsistent with the Text  \n1. Innovations in training\u2014Debater_B\u2019s focus\u2014are confined to single generations and do not alter the underlying secular trends. Even the author\u2019s \u201ctrivial case\u201d of curing a fever with antibiotics affects only that runner\u2019s performance that day, not the entire population\u2019s progress over decades.  \n2. The author explicitly contrasts \u201ctechnology or training\u201d with the demographic patterns that \u201caffect us all.\u201d If training innovations drove records, then performances would plateau if training stopped advancing\u2014but he argues they would continue rising regardless.  \n\nIII. Evidence That Improvements Require Multiple Generations  \n1. Secular trends are defined as long-term modifications, not brief fluctuations. The author cites increases in average body size, earlier maturation (age of menarche falling by \u201cthree or four months per decade\u201d), and longer life expectancy\u2014all changes only visible over many decades.  \n   \u2022 \u201cSecular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.\u201d (Background)  \n   \u2022 \u201cGirls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche\u2026has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years.\u201d  \n2. Nutritional improvements and healthcare advances operate generation by generation: better-fed children grow into stronger adults, who in turn raise better-nourished children. This compound effect takes multiple generations to yield the dramatic rises in performance records.  \n3. The growth of the global middle class and the explosion of population widen the talent pool over time. Britain, once dominant, now wins fewer medals not because its training declined, but because more nations and healthier populations have joined the Olympics.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of Debater_B  \n1. Debater_B overstates the effectiveness of immediate training \u201cinnovations.\u201d While a new shoe or lactic-acid test might trim milliseconds off an individual\u2019s time, it cannot account for a mile-record drop from 4:00 to 3:44 over forty years. Only underlying physiological shifts across birth cohorts can.  \n2. If one generation\u2019s training were the key factor, improvements would track the release of new technologies. Instead, the record-setting curve remains smooth and continuous, mirroring gradual secular changes\u2014exactly what the author describes.  \n3. The author\u2019s comparison to race-horse breeding demonstrates that even purpose-built genetic selection quickly hits a biomechanical ceiling. Only long-term environmental enhancement has driven human records upward without plateau.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe author argues that athletic performances improve primarily because the human \u201cmachine\u201d itself is changing\u2014through nutrition, healthcare, maturation, and a growing athlete pool\u2014over multiple generations. He dismisses one-generation training advances as mere tinkering. Therefore, the innovations in athletic training have their greatest impact not on a single generation\u2019s records, but on the demographic evolution of athletes across many generations.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"One generation of humans\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Summary of the Author\u2019s Argument  \n1. The author repeatedly downplays the impact of new training methods, shoes, nutrition, and other technological \u201ctinkering.\u201d He writes that these advances are \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d and that \u201csports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896.\u201d (Background)  \n2. Instead, he attributes the steady improvement in performances (four-minute miles, jumping, sprinting) to long-term demographic and environmental trends that unfold over many generations\u2014better nutrition, health care, larger, faster-maturing bodies, and a vastly expanded pool of potential athletes.  \n\nII. Why \u201cOne Generation\u201d Is Inconsistent with the Text  \n1. Innovations in training\u2014Debater_B\u2019s focus\u2014are confined to single generations and do not alter the underlying secular trends. Even the author\u2019s \u201ctrivial case\u201d of curing a fever with antibiotics affects only that runner\u2019s performance that day, not the entire population\u2019s progress over decades.  \n2. The author explicitly contrasts \u201ctechnology or training\u201d with the demographic patterns that \u201caffect us all.\u201d If training innovations drove records, then performances would plateau if training stopped advancing\u2014but he argues they would continue rising regardless.  \n\nIII. Evidence That Improvements Require Multiple Generations  \n1. Secular trends are defined as long-term modifications, not brief fluctuations. The author cites increases in average body size, earlier maturation (age of menarche falling by \u201cthree or four months per decade\u201d), and longer life expectancy\u2014all changes only visible over many decades.  \n   \u2022 \u201cSecular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.\u201d (Background)  \n   \u2022 \u201cGirls menstruate earlier than they used to.

Nutritional improvements and healthcare advances operate generation by generation: better-fed children grow into stronger adults, who in turn raise better-nourished children. This compound effect takes multiple generations to yield the dramatic rises in performance records.  \n3. The growth of the global middle class and the explosion of population widen the talent pool over time. Britain, once dominant, now wins fewer medals not because its training declined, but because more nations and healthier populations have joined the Olympics.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of Debater_B  \n1. Debater_B overstates the effectiveness of immediate training \u201cinnovations.\u201d While a new shoe or lactic-acid test might trim milliseconds off an individual\u2019s time, it cannot account for a mile-record drop from 4:00 to 3:44 over forty years. Only underlying physiological shifts across birth cohorts can.  \n2. If one generation\u2019s training were the key factor, improvements would track the release of new technologies.

Conclusion  \nThe author argues that athletic performances improve primarily because the human \u201cmachine\u201d itself is changing\u2014through nutrition, healthcare, maturation, and a growing athlete pool\u2014over multiple generations. He dismisses one-generation training advances as mere tinkering. Therefore, the innovations in athletic training have their greatest impact not on a single generation\u2019s records, but on the demographic evolution of athletes across many generations.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Summary of Positions  \nDebater A claims that innovations in athletic training exert their greatest influence cumulatively over multiple generations. I maintain instead that new training methods primarily boost performance within a single generation\u2014what coaches call the \u201cquick fix,\u201d not a multigenerational shift.\n\nII. Critique of Debater A\u2019s Argument  \n1. Conflation of Secular Trends and Training Effects  \n   a. Debater A repeatedly cites \u201csecular\u201d improvements\u2014better nutrition, healthcare, larger talent pools\u2014as evidence that training innovations change populations over decades (<quote> These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns </quote>). But these are exactly the points Berry uses to argue that training innovations are merely \u201ctinkering\u201d in any long-term sense.  \n   b. The background makes clear that secular trends\u2014improved diet, medical care, population growth\u2014are what drive multigenerational gains, not training. Training improvements, by contrast, would have produced only marginal, single-generation gains (<quote>Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they</quote>). Debater A\u2019s position flips the cause and effect.\n\n2. Lack of Evidence for Cumulative Genetic Change via Training  \n   a. Debater A implies that training innovations are inherited across generations. Yet exercises and regimens have no genetic or epigenetic mechanism for passing on improvements. Berry explicitly states that natural selection for athletic prowess ended long ago and that training probably reduces, not increases, athletes\u2019 reproductive success (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days \u2026 today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children than average\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Without a plausible heritable mechanism, you cannot attribute multigenerational improvement to training.  \n\nIII. Defense of One-Generation Impact  \n1. Immediate Physiological Adaptations  \n   a. New training techniques (e.g., altitude chambers, interval training) trigger acute physiological responses\u2014higher VO2 max, lactic-acid tolerance\u2014that manifest within months. These benefits vanish if the regimen is discontinued and cannot be passed on to offspring.  \n   b. Berry acknowledges that whether antibiotics cure an athlete\u2019s fever before a race is a trivial but direct one\u2010generation benefit (<quote>y, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race,</quote>). That\u2019s training/medical innovation acting in a single generation.\n\n2. Technological \u201cTinkering\u201d Yields Diminishing Returns Over Time  \n   a. If training innovations truly had multigenerational impact, we would see accelerating improvements in records. Instead, Berry points out that horses\u2014subject to the most intensive breeding and training\u2014have plateaued in speed (<quote> Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit.</quote>). Humans, with far less systematic genetic selection, show steady but decelerating gains largely attributable to environment, not evolving training methods.  \n   b. This plateau suggests that beyond a single\u2010generation performance bump, training innovations cannot generate long-term cumulative gains.\n\n3. Evidence from Controlled Training Studies  \n   a. Sports science routinely measures the impact of a training protocol on athletes over a season or two. Improvements are quantifiable in that cohort; there is no follow\u2010up study showing that a champion\u2019s children run faster because mom used a novel plyometric routine.  \n   b. Thus, training breakthroughs remain confined to the generation that directly employs them.\n\nIV. Conclusion  \nInnovations in athletic training deliver measurable gains within the generation that adopts them\u2014but have no mechanism to propagate those gains genetically or epigenetically to subsequent generations. True multigenerational improvements arise from broad secular trends\u2014nutrition, healthcare, population size\u2014not from the latest training regimen. Therefore, the author believes training innovations most impact one generation of humans, not many over time.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Rebuttal of Debater B\u2019s Main Points  \n1. Misreading of \u201cInnovation\u201d vs. \u201cTinkering\u201d  \n   \u2022 Debater B conflates the author\u2019s dismissal of marginal gadget-and-shoe improvements with a denial that training methods can ever have long-term, population-wide effects. But Berry\u2019s critique is aimed at one-off sidelines (\u201cone-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time\u201d)\u2014not at systematic training paradigms that diffuse across cohorts and raise the floor for every following generation.  \n\n2. False Assumption That Training Gains Cannot Transmit Across Generations  \n   \u2022 Debater B insists there is \u201cno heritable mechanism\u201d for training innovations. That ignores cultural inheritance: coaches pass on best practices to their prote\u0301ge\u0301s, who become future coaches, who train the next cohort, and so on. These methods accumulate, becoming part of the \u201cenvironment\u201d into which each new generation is born.  \n\n3. The Horse-Breeding Analogy Cuts the Other Way  \n   \u2022 Debater B cites plateauing race-horse times as proof that training innovations hit a ceiling in one generation. But horses benefit from centuries of selective breeding, not from cultural transmission of training science. Humans, by contrast, have seen enduring record improvements precisely because training knowledge has been shared globally\u2014improving each generation\u2019s baseline fitness.  \n\nII. Evidence That Training Innovations Impact Multiple Generations  \n1. Continuous Adoption and Refinement  \n   \u2022 Altitude training, interval workouts, biomechanical film analysis, strength-and-conditioning protocols\u2014all innovations introduced in one decade become standard curricula in athletic programs worldwide. Each new intake of athletes starts from a higher baseline. Over decades, these layered improvements transform the entire population of competitors.  \n\n2. Smooth, Long-Term Record Curves Mirror Cumulative Training Effects  \n   \u2022 If each innovation only \u201ctinkered\u201d with one generation, world-record progress would rise in jagged leaps\u2014spiking when a novel method appeared, then flattening as it disappeared. Instead, records improve in a remarkably smooth, exponential-style curve over more than a century. That pattern is characteristic of gradual, multigenerational diffusion of training science.  \n\n3. Demography and Training Reinforce Each Other  \n   \u2022 Better nutrition and healthcare produce bigger, healthier bodies (the author\u2019s \u201csecular trends\u201d). But without upgraded training techniques, those bodies would not achieve their biomechanical potential. Conversely, as training methods advance, they magnify the benefits of each demographic cohort\u2014lifting every generation above the last.  \n\nIII. Why \u201cOne Generation\u201d Cannot Explain Olympic Progress  \n1. Lack of Correlation with Single-Innovation Releases  \n   \u2022 No single breakthrough in sports science coincides exactly with the steady advances in sprint times, marathon records, or jumping distances. Innovations may be introduced, but performances climb regardless\u2014evidence that the gains are baked into successive generations\u2019 training environments, not one-off bursts.  \n\n2. Global Dissemination Necessitates Time  \n   \u2022 Novel regimens invented in one country do not instantly reach every corner of the world. They spread through journals, coaching clinics, athlete exchanges\u2014often taking years or decades before universal adoption. Their full impact thus spans multiple generations.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s emphasis on long-term, \u201csecular\u201d improvements in nutrition, health, body size, and maturation does not preclude a central role for training innovations\u2014it simply situates those innovations within a multigenerational framework. Training methods exert their greatest influence not as one-generation quick fixes but as cultural and technical legacies that successive cohorts inherit, refine, and pass on. Only by acknowledging that these innovations accumulate over many generations can we explain the remarkably smooth, century-long ascent of athletic records. Therefore, the author believes innovations in athletic training have the most impact on multiple generations of humans over time.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Rebuttal of Debater A\u2019s Misreadings  \n1. Mistaking \u201cLong-Term Trends\u201d for Training Effects  \n   a. Debater A claims the mile record\u2019s smooth decline (4:00 \u2192 3:44) mirrors \u201csecular\u201d changes, not training. But the author says exactly the opposite: if training and technology hadn\u2019t improved, records would still tumble at today\u2019s rate <quote>Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they</quote>. That line means training alone would generate only the small, incremental gains we see in a single generation, not the multidecade record shift.  \n   b. Secular trends (nutrition, health care, population growth) drive generational baselines, but training innovations produce the large, immediate leaps\u2014new interval schedules, altitude chambers, refined biomechanics\u2014that create the \u201cstep\u201d improvements you see within five-to-ten years, not across a century.  \n\n2. No Heritable Pathway for Training Breakthroughs  \n   a. Debater A suggests \u201cchildren of well-trained athletes\u201d inherit advantages. Berry directly refutes any training-to-genes link: \u201cthe laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days\u2026today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children than average.\u201d Training has no genetic channel.  \n   b. Without epigenetic or genetic transmission, any gain from a novel conditioning protocol affects only those who undertake it. That is by definition a one-generation effect.  \n\nII. Strengthening the One-Generation Case  \n1. The Author\u2019s Own Examples Emphasize Immediate Impact  \n   a. He calls antibiotics curing a fever \u201ctrivial\u201d yet undeniable evidence of single-generation benefit <quote> say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race,</quote>. That\u2019s precisely a training/medical innovation raising performance for that athlete and that season alone.  \n   b. Every new shoe design, high-altitude camp, sports-medicine procedure produces measurable upticks in the cohort using them\u2014then plateaus as competitors adopt the same methods.  \n\n2. Diminishing Returns and Plateaus Show No Cumulative Training Effect  \n   a. Race horses, bred and trained for centuries, now show no further speed gains <quote> Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. </quote>. If cumulative training across generations truly accumulated, horses would still be accelerating. They aren\u2019t\u2014because training can only tweak today\u2019s animal, not remodel the species.  \n   b. Human records likewise slow when everyone has mastered the latest conditioning tricks. Subsequent improvements require new breakthroughs, not the carryover of last generation\u2019s regimen.  \n\n3. Controlled Studies Confirm Generation-Limited Gains  \n   a. In sports science, coaches test a new protocol on one season\u2019s squad: you see VO2-max jumps or sprint-split improvements that year, but there\u2019s no study showing those kids\u2019 offspring pick up their parents\u2019 interval sets in the womb.  \n   b. If training had multigenerational power, sports medicine would track children of elite-program athletes outperforming peers without ever training. No such effect exists.  \n\nIII. Why Debater A\u2019s Long-Term Demographics Are Distinct  \n1. Nutrition, healthcare, earlier maturation\u2014those are \u201csecular trends\u201d acting over multiple generations, not training innovations. Berry repeatedly separates the two: \u201cThese minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote>.  \n2. Debater A conflates secular environmental shifts with training breakthroughs. The former remodel the entire population\u2019s baseline over decades; the latter lift a single cohort\u2019s ceiling over months or years.\n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s central claim is that genuine multigenerational gains in athletics arise only from broad environmental and demographic forces\u2014better diet, healthcare, population size and maturity. In contrast, innovations in training, shoes, or medical therapies yield their benefits solely within the generation that adopts them. No genetic or epigenetic route passes a training method to offspring. Therefore, the author believes training innovations have their greatest impact on one generation of humans, not on multiple generations over time.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
