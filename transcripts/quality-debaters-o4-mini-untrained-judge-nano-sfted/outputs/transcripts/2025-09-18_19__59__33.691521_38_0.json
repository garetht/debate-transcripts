    "background_text": "Diamonds in the Rough \n\n         Fourscore and seven years ago, the first steel and concrete baseball palace opened for business. Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n",

And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations.

But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that \u201cthe fields have new shapes\u201d is the key beneficial feature of these parks.  That\u2019s simply a superficial reading of the text.  The author acknowledges asymmetrical outfields\u2014\u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d is how Camden Yards is praised (\u201crevived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark\u201d)\u2014but this is described as a matter of copying an aesthetic precedent, not a core benefit of fan experience.  Worse, asymmetry alone says nothing about spectators\u2019 comfort, convenience, or enjoyment beyond novelty.\n\nIn contrast, the author explicitly celebrates the new parks\u2019 vastly improved food-service facilities and dining options\u2014something that directly enhances every fan\u2019s experience:\n\n1.  Abundant Concessions  \n    The author lists \u201celevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites.\u201d  Notice how \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d sits squarely among the top conveniences.  It\u2019s not a throwaway line; it\u2019s part of the author\u2019s enumeration of the new parks\u2019 charms over the old \u201ccold and sterile stadiums\u201d of the multipurpose era.  \n\n2.  Gourmet and Club-Level Fare  \n    Beyond mere concession stands, the text highlights \u201cclub decks\u201d with \u201cwait staff who peddle gourmet fare,\u201d plus \u201cmembers-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants.\u201d  These are transformative upgrades, turning a baseball game into a full culinary outing\u2014far beyond the peanut-and-beer model of earlier parks.\n\n3.  Diversity of Price Points and Experiences  \n    With everything from general-admission food stands to luxury-suite catering, the new parks cater to a wider spectrum of fans.  That diversity addresses one of the era\u2019s biggest faults: the \u201ccaste system\u201d of seating and amenities.  While the author does criticize the erosion of cheap seats, he never blames dining diversity\u2014in fact, he implies we should be \u201cthankful\u201d for the new parks\u2019 charms, among which food offerings rank high.\n\nIn short, while asymmetrical fields are a stylistic flourish, the text\u2019s true emphasis on design benefits centers on comfort, convenience, and especially a richer, more varied dining environment.  That is the feature the author highlights as genuinely beneficial\u2014\u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d\u2014and it is indisputably more central to fan experience than novel field shapes.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims the key benefit is \u201ca greater diversity of dining,\u201d but the background text never elevates food options to a design highlight. Dining stands are mentioned only in passing as one of many modern amenities\u2014alongside elevators, widened concourses, and luxury suites\u2014but never as an architecturally distinctive feature. In contrast, the text explicitly celebrates the parks\u2019 novel field shapes and asymmetries:\n\n1. The author repeatedly praises the revival of \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d and \u201crelatively intimate, steel-structured\u201d parks. He credits Baltimore\u2019s Oriole Park at Camden Yards with a \u201cconceptual breakthrough,\u201d inspiring successors that \u201ctake their cues\u201d in both form and planning.  \n2. Even \u201ctotally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield,\u201d showing that unusual field geometry is a defining, copied trait.  \n3. In his conclusion, the author observes that the new \u201cbaseball shrines \u2026 boast interestingly shaped playing fields,\u201d calling them a primary visual draw.\n\nThese points show that designers intentionally broke from the rigid symmetry of the \u201960s and \u201970s multipurpose stadiums to reintroduce unique outfield contours, quirky angles, and varied foul-territory geometry\u2014features explicitly lauded as beneficial. Dining variety, by contrast, is mentioned only as part of the general trend toward more concessions and clubs, not as a celebrated design innovation. Therefore, the argument that \u201cthe fields have new shapes\u201d directly matches the text\u2019s emphasis on asymmetrical, interestingly shaped playing surfaces\u2014and is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced.

These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims the key benefit is \u201ca greater diversity of dining,\u201d but the background text never elevates food options to a design highlight. Dining stands are mentioned only in passing as one of many modern amenities\u2014alongside elevators, widened concourses, and luxury suites\u2014but never as an architecturally distinctive feature. In contrast, the text explicitly celebrates the parks\u2019 novel field shapes and asymmetries:\n\n1. The author repeatedly praises the revival of \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d and \u201crelatively intimate, steel-structured\u201d parks. He credits Baltimore\u2019s Oriole Park at Camden Yards with a \u201cconceptual breakthrough,\u201d inspiring successors that \u201ctake their cues\u201d in both form and planning.  \n2. Even \u201ctotally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield,\u201d showing that unusual field geometry is a defining, copied trait.  \n3. In his conclusion, the author observes that the new \u201cbaseball shrines \u2026 boast interestingly shaped playing fields,\u201d calling them a primary visual draw.\n\nThese points show that designers intentionally broke from the rigid symmetry of the \u201960s and \u201970s multipurpose stadiums to reintroduce unique outfield contours, quirky angles, and varied foul-territory geometry\u2014features explicitly lauded as beneficial. Dining variety, by contrast, is mentioned only as part of the general trend toward more concessions and clubs, not as a celebrated design innovation. Therefore, the argument that \u201cthe fields have new shapes\u201d directly matches the text\u2019s emphasis on asymmetrical, interestingly shaped playing surfaces\u2014and is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that \u201cthe fields have new shapes\u201d is the key beneficial feature of these parks.  That\u2019s simply a superficial reading of the text.  The author acknowledges asymmetrical outfields\u2014\u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d is how Camden Yards is praised (\u201crevived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark\u201d)\u2014but this is described as a matter of copying an aesthetic precedent, not a core benefit of fan experience.  Worse, asymmetry alone says nothing about spectators\u2019 comfort, convenience, or enjoyment beyond novelty.\n\nIn contrast, the author explicitly celebrates the new parks\u2019 vastly improved food-service facilities and dining options\u2014something that directly enhances every fan\u2019s experience:\n\n1.  Abundant Concessions  \n    The author lists \u201celevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites.\u201d  Notice how \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d sits squarely among the top conveniences.  It\u2019s not a throwaway line; it\u2019s part of the author\u2019s enumeration of the new parks\u2019 charms over the old \u201ccold and sterile stadiums\u201d of the multipurpose era.  \n\n2.  Gourmet and Club-Level Fare  \n    Beyond mere concession stands, the text highlights \u201cclub decks\u201d with \u201cwait staff who peddle gourmet fare,\u201d plus \u201cmembers-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants.\u201d  These are transformative upgrades, turning a baseball game into a full culinary outing\u2014far beyond the peanut-and-beer model of earlier parks.\n\n3.  Diversity of Price Points and Experiences  \n    With everything from general-admission food stands to luxury-suite catering, the new parks cater to a wider spectrum of fans.  That diversity addresses one of the era\u2019s biggest faults: the \u201ccaste system\u201d of seating and amenities.  While the author does criticize the erosion of cheap seats, he never blames dining diversity\u2014in fact, he implies we should be \u201cthankful\u201d for the new parks\u2019 charms, among which food offerings rank high.\n\nIn short, while asymmetrical fields are a stylistic flourish, the text\u2019s true emphasis on design benefits centers on comfort, convenience, and especially a richer, more varied dining environment.  That is the feature the author highlights as genuinely beneficial\u2014\u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d\u2014and it is indisputably more central to fan experience than novel field shapes.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The fields have new shapes\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Therefore, the argument that \u201cthe fields have new shapes\u201d directly matches the text\u2019s emphasis on asymmetrical, interestingly shaped playing surfaces\u2014and is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s argument rests on the claim that \u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d are a highlighted design benefit, but that overstates the role of field geometry in the author\u2019s praise. In fact, asymmetry is admired as a visual or nostalgic cue\u2014but the author\u2019s substantive excitement centers on amenities that improve comfort, convenience, and the overall fan experience, chief among them the expanded and varied dining options.  \n\n1. Asymmetry as Style, Not Substance  \n   \u2022 The author calls Camden Yards \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d and notes that successors \u201cemulate the asymmetry,\u201d but presents this as copying a nostalgic look, not as a core functional improvement.  \n   \u2022 He never ties the fan experience\u2014sightlines, comfort, community\u2014directly to field shape. In contrast, he repeatedly links amenities to the quality of attending a game.  \n\n2. Dining and Concession Diversity as a Repeated Benefit  \n   \u2022 The text places \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d alongside \u201celevators, wider concourses, [and] abundant toilets\u201d in a list of the new parks\u2019 charms, signaling that concessions are as essential to the fan experience as safety and ease of movement. <quote>-elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites-</quote>  \n   \u2022 The author goes beyond mere quantity: he highlights \u201cclub decks\u2026with wait staff who peddle gourmet fare,\u201d and \u201cmembers-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants,\u201d underscoring that these parks offer a spectrum of culinary experiences from casual to gourmet.  \n\n3. Impact on the Fan Experience  \n   \u2022 Diverse dining transforms the game into a social occasion\u2014fans aren\u2019t just watching baseball, they\u2019re partaking in an upgraded hospitality environment. That boost in comfort and variety is repeatedly framed as a genuine improvement over the \u201ccold and sterile stadiums\u201d of prior eras.  \n   \u2022 By contrast, asymmetrical fields are almost always discussed as an aesthetic choice\u2014\u201ca conceptual breakthrough\u201d that\u2019s copied in form, not as something that improves accessibility, intimacy, or enjoyment in an everyday sense.  \n\n4. Authorial Emphasis  \n   \u2022 The author closes by noting that new parks are \u201cvisually impressive\u201d and have \u201cinteresting playing fields,\u201d but immediately goes on to detail how many are \u201clarge and expensive\u2026hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system.\u201d He reserves real praise for design elements that unite community and convenience\u2014food service is a central pillar of that convenience.  \n\nIn sum, the text\u2019s repeated, explicit celebration of \u201cplentiful food stands,\u201d gourmet club-level fare, and on-site bars and restaurants shows that \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is the concrete design benefit the author highlights. Field asymmetry is a nostalgic flourish; dining diversity is an everyday improvement that the author clearly values.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater A\u2019s \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d claim conflates ancillary concessions with core design innovations. The author does list food stands, bars, and clubs as part of modern amenities, but never frames them as a defining architectural breakthrough. In contrast, the text repeatedly singles out field geometry as a celebrated design feature:\n\n1.  Explicit Praise for Asymmetry  \n    The author credits Baltimore\u2019s Oriole Park at Camden Yards with \u201creviv[ing] the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark\u201d and calls that \u201cconceptual breakthrough\u201d the model for subsequent parks.<quote> revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. </quote>  \n\n2.  Universal Emulation of Novel Shapes  \n    Even parks with no urban context\u2014Phoenix, Miami, Tampa Bay\u2014\u201cemulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield,\u201d proving that unusual field contours are the trait every designer wants to copy.<quote> Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. </quote>  \n\n3.  Highlighted as a Primary Visual Draw  \n    In summing up the new \u201cbaseball shrines,\u201d the author notes they \u201cboast interestingly shaped playing fields,\u201d placing field shape on equal or higher footing than any other feature.<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most \u2026 boast interestingly shaped playing fields\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\nBy contrast, dining facilities appear in a laundry list of conveniences\u2014\u201celevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites\u201d\u2014but are never singled out as a distinctive design breakthrough.<quote> A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. </quote> That passage lauds materials and forms, not concessions.\n\nTherefore, the author\u2019s text clearly identifies \u201cnew shapes\u201d and asymmetrical field geometry as standout design features\u2014far more so than expanded dining. The correct answer is that the parks\u2019 fields have new, interesting shapes.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
