A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that Keynes held that interest rates are driven by people\u2019s \u201cliquidity preference,\u201d i.e. their desire to hold cash rather than less-liquid assets. That\u2019s a misreading of Keynes\u2019s core insight. In fact, even Keynes insisted that interest rates ultimately serve to equilibrate saving and investment. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Keynes\u2019s own statement that \u201csavings and investment are still necessarily equal\u201d  \n   \u2022 As Keynes wrote, \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 the level of employment and output.\u201d (para. 5)  \n   \u2022 In other words, though he introduced liquidity preference to explain why interest might deviate in the short run, he never abandoned the fundamental identity that the interest rate must adjust to bring savings and investment into balance.\n\n2. Liquidity preference is only a proximate determinant, not the ultimate one  \n   \u2022 Liquidity preference describes the public\u2019s short-term demand for cash, but that demand only matters because it must equal what investors are willing to save at that rate. If desired savings and desired investment don\u2019t match, employment and output shift until they do\u2014and along the way, interest rates move to clear that gap.  \n   \u2022 As the text notes, Keynes \u201cwas willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run\u201d the classical theories \u201cmight indeed be valid.\u201d (para. 4) In the classical\u2014and even in Keynes\u2019s long-run view\u2014the interest rate is precisely the price that equates saving with investment.\n\n3. The \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d and other paradoxes hinge on the savings/investment identity  \n   \u2022 The famous Keynesian \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d holds that higher desired saving can reduce actual saving only if interest rates fail to adjust. But that paradox rests on the principle that, in equilibrium, interest rates ensure S = I. Absent that mechanism, the paradox evaporates.  \n   \u2022 Thus Keynes\u2019s real innovation was to redraw the adjustment path in the short run\u2014via liquidity preference\u2014but never to discard the underlying saving\u2013investment balance that determines rates.\n\n4. Debater B\u2019s reading wrongly elevates liquidity preference above the saving\u2013investment framework  \n   \u2022 It makes no sense to say that liquidity preference overrides the fact that \u201csavings and investment were still necessarily equal\u201d (para. 5). Keynes introduced liquidity preference as the mechanism by which the interest rate moves, not as an alternative to the saving\u2013investment equilibrium.  \n   \u2022 If liquidity preference were truly primary, then changes in desired savings would have no bearing on rates. But Keynes explicitly shows that if desired savings exceed desired investment, rates must change\u2014or output must fall\u2014to restore equality.\n\nConclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s short-run emphasis on liquidity preference enriches the theory of how rates move, but it in no way replaces the fundamental truth that \u201csavings and investment\u201d must be in balance. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \u201cWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest?\u201d is that interest rates adjust to equate saving with investment.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Keynes explicitly rejected the \u201cloanable-funds\u201d view that interest is set by equating savings and investment. As he wrote, classical theory might hold \u201cin the long run,\u201d but \u201cin the short run\u201d interest is determined by liquidity preference\u2014\u201cthe public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets.\u201d  <invalid_quote>\u201cIn the short run \u2026 interest rates were determined \u2026 by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets.\u201d</invalid_quote>\n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s reliance on the balance of savings and investment misreads Keynes. He agreed that ex post savings must equal investment, but insisted that this identity does not explain the rate of interest. Rather, if desired savings exceed desired investment at full-employment rates, output and employment adjust\u2014and *then* the Fed or markets adjust interest. Under Keynes, it is liquidity preference that initially drives the rate.\n\n3. The \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d and other Keynesian \u201cparadoxes\u201d arise precisely because interest is not a pure function of saving-investment balance. If saving rises, liquidity preference shifts, raising idle cash holdings and causing a slump that lowers both income and investment\u2014contrary to the classical view that higher saving *must* lower interest and boost investment.\n\n4. The background text emphasizes that once you re-insert an active central bank managing rates, you restore some classical results\u2014but Keynes\u2019s core point remains that, absent policy offsets, interest is rooted in liquidity preference. The text states:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad \u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent \u2026 or that \u2026 potential savings are so high \u2026 that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   That presumes the rate *comes from* liquidity preference and is then countered by policy\u2014not the other way around.\n\n5. In sum, the correct answer\u2014what Keynes *posited*\u2014is that interest is set by the public\u2019s willingness to hold money unless offered sufficient incentive to hold bonds or other assets. Debater_A\u2019s \u201csavings-investment balance\u201d is a later classical framing that Keynes specifically displaced for short-run analysis.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Balance between savings and investment\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output.

You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable.

That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Keynes explicitly rejected the \u201cloanable-funds\u201d view that interest is set by equating savings and investment. As he wrote, classical theory might hold \u201cin the long run,\u201d but \u201cin the short run\u201d interest is determined by liquidity preference\u2014\u201cthe public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets.\u201d  <invalid_quote>\u201cIn the short run \u2026 interest rates were determined \u2026 by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets.\u201d</invalid_quote>\n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s reliance on the balance of savings and investment misreads Keynes. He agreed that ex post savings must equal investment, but insisted that this identity does not explain the rate of interest. Rather, if desired savings exceed desired investment at full-employment rates, output and employment adjust\u2014and *then* the Fed or markets adjust interest. Under Keynes, it is liquidity preference that initially drives the rate.\n\n3. The \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d and other Keynesian \u201cparadoxes\u201d arise precisely because interest is not a pure function of saving-investment balance. If saving rises, liquidity preference shifts, raising idle cash holdings and causing a slump that lowers both income and investment\u2014contrary to the classical view that higher saving *must* lower interest and boost investment.\n\n4. The background text emphasizes that once you re-insert an active central bank managing rates, you restore some classical results\u2014but Keynes\u2019s core point remains that, absent policy offsets, interest is rooted in liquidity preference. The text states:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad \u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent \u2026 or that \u2026 potential savings are so high \u2026 that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   That presumes the rate *comes from* liquidity preference and is then countered by policy\u2014not the other way around.\n\n5. In sum, the correct answer\u2014what Keynes *posited*\u2014is that interest is set by the public\u2019s willingness to hold money unless offered sufficient incentive to hold bonds or other assets. Debater_A\u2019s \u201csavings-investment balance\u201d is a later classical framing that Keynes specifically displaced for short-run analysis.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that Keynes held that interest rates are driven by people\u2019s \u201cliquidity preference,\u201d i.e. their desire to hold cash rather than less-liquid assets. That\u2019s a misreading of Keynes\u2019s core insight. In fact, even Keynes insisted that interest rates ultimately serve to equilibrate saving and investment. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Keynes\u2019s own statement that \u201csavings and investment are still necessarily equal\u201d  \n   \u2022 As Keynes wrote, \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 the level of employment and output.\u201d (para. 5)  \n   \u2022 In other words, though he introduced liquidity preference to explain why interest might deviate in the short run, he never abandoned the fundamental identity that the interest rate must adjust to bring savings and investment into balance.\n\n2. Liquidity preference is only a proximate determinant, not the ultimate one  \n   \u2022 Liquidity preference describes the public\u2019s short-term demand for cash, but that demand only matters because it must equal what investors are willing to save at that rate. If desired savings and desired investment don\u2019t match, employment and output shift until they do\u2014and along the way, interest rates move to clear that gap.  \n   \u2022 As the text notes, Keynes \u201cwas willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run\u201d the classical theories \u201cmight indeed be valid.\u201d (para. 4) In the classical\u2014and even in Keynes\u2019s long-run view\u2014the interest rate is precisely the price that equates saving with investment.\n\n3. The \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d and other paradoxes hinge on the savings/investment identity  \n   \u2022 The famous Keynesian \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d holds that higher desired saving can reduce actual saving only if interest rates fail to adjust. But that paradox rests on the principle that, in equilibrium, interest rates ensure S = I. Absent that mechanism, the paradox evaporates.  \n   \u2022 Thus Keynes\u2019s real innovation was to redraw the adjustment path in the short run\u2014via liquidity preference\u2014but never to discard the underlying saving\u2013investment balance that determines rates.\n\n4. Debater B\u2019s reading wrongly elevates liquidity preference above the saving\u2013investment framework  \n   \u2022 It makes no sense to say that liquidity preference overrides the fact that \u201csavings and investment were still necessarily equal\u201d (para. 5). Keynes introduced liquidity preference as the mechanism by which the interest rate moves, not as an alternative to the saving\u2013investment equilibrium.  \n   \u2022 If liquidity preference were truly primary, then changes in desired savings would have no bearing on rates. But Keynes explicitly shows that if desired savings exceed desired investment, rates must change\u2014or output must fall\u2014to restore equality.\n\nConclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s short-run emphasis on liquidity preference enriches the theory of how rates move, but it in no way replaces the fundamental truth that \u201csavings and investment\u201d must be in balance. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \u201cWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest?\u201d is that interest rates adjust to equate saving with investment.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

In sum, the correct answer\u2014what Keynes *posited*\u2014is that interest is set by the public\u2019s willingness to hold money unless offered sufficient incentive to hold bonds or other assets. Debater_A\u2019s \u201csavings-investment balance\u201d is a later classical framing that Keynes specifically displaced for short-run analysis.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater B conflates ex post identities with causal determinants  \n   \u2022 Keynes nowhere claimed that liquidity preference *replaces* the saving\u2013investment mechanism. He wrote that \u201csavings and investment were still necessarily equal\u201d and that if desired savings exceeded desired investment at full employment, the result would be a decline in output and employment, not a magical interest-rate anchor divorced from S=I. <quote>investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment</quote> (para. 5)  \n   \u2022 That is the classical \u201cloanable-funds\u201d identity: the interest rate must adjust so that ex ante planned savings equals planned investment. Nothing in Keynes\u2019s text overthrows that fundamental equilibrium condition.\n\n2. Liquidity preference is a *shifter* of the demand curve for loanable funds, not a standalone theory  \n   \u2022 Keynes introduced liquidity preference to explain why, in the short run, the interest rate might deviate from the classical expectation. But this is merely a shift in the demand for money or bonds\u2014*within* the same framework where rates clear S=I.  \n   \u2022 Even in The General Theory, Keynes concedes that in \u201csome sufficiently long run\u201d the classical view holds. <quote>In the long run we are all dead.</quote> (para. 4) He invokes liquidity preference only to capture short-run frictions, not to displace the saving\u2013investment equilibrium.\n\n3. The paradoxes of thrift and the widow\u2019s cruse depend on the saving\u2013investment identity being operative  \n   \u2022 These \u201cparadoxes\u201d rest on the idea that if liquidity preference shifts sharply, the interest rate may not adjust enough to equate savings and investment, leading to a contraction in output. But *that* underscores, rather than contradicts, the central role of S=I in determining the rate.  \n   \u2022 If liquidity preference were truly the sole determinant, there would be no paradox of thrift\u2014higher desired savings would simply raise the rate and bring investment up to match, with no slump. That collapse happens precisely *because* rates fail to clear S=I fully, forcing output instead to adjust.\n\n4. Debater B misreads Keynes\u2019s short-run focus as a denial of the loanable-funds mechanism  \n   \u2022 Debater B insists Keynes \u201cexplicitly rejected\u201d the loanable-funds view in favor of liquidity preference. But Keynes says only that the classical story holds in the long run; in the short run, liquidity preference explains why interest may stick above the classical equilibrium. He never claimed that liquidity preference *supplants* the saving\u2013investment balance.  \n   \u2022 The background text reinforces this: when you add an active Fed that adjusts rates to target unemployment, \u201call the paradoxes of thrift \u2026 become irrelevant\u201d precisely *because* the Fed is restoring the S=I equilibrium via rate cuts or hikes. That presumes that rates must in fact equate savings and investment for full-employment output.\n\n5. Conclusion: Keynes\u2019s theory\u2014however enriched by liquidity preference\u2014remains a theory of interest as the price that equilibrates saving and investment. Calling liquidity preference the *primary* influence misstates Keynes\u2019s own words. The correct answer to the question \u201cWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest?\u201d is that it adjusts to balance savings and investment.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater A confuses an accounting identity with Keynes\u2019s causal theory of interest.  Yes, Keynes emphasizes that \u201csavings and investment were still necessarily equal\u201d (<quote>investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment</quote>).  But identities (ex post S=I) tell us only that in the end dollars saved show up in investment \u2014 not what *drives* the price of borrowing in the first place.\n\n2. Keynes\u2019s whole point was that in the *short run* the interest rate is set by liquidity preference, not by a mechanical clearing of saving and investment.  As he wrote:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cIn the short run \u2026 interest rates were determined \u2026 by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   That is his *definition* of the interest rate: the \u201creward\u201d necessary to induce people to part with money balances.\n\n3. Debater A\u2019s story\u2014that rates \u201cmust\u201d adjust to equilibrate desired saving and investment\u2014only applies once you assume away liquidity preference.  But Keynes shows exactly the opposite: if liquidity preference is strong (people hoarding cash), interest rates can\u2019t fall by enough, output slumps, income falls, and only then does saving *ex post* equal investment.  That is the mechanism behind the paradox of thrift, not some obscure long-run restoration of classical forces.\n\n4. The text underlines that classical forces (S-I adjustment) only re-emerge when a central bank actively pegs rates.  In that case, policy restores S=I at the target rate.  But that is a *policy overlay* on top of Keynes\u2019s core: without a Fed offset, it is liquidity preference that sets rates.  The very need to argue whether the Fed is \u201cimpotent\u201d or not presumes liquidity preference is the baseline determinant.\n\n5. Finally, Debater A\u2019s reading collapses Keynes\u2019s theory back into the classical \u201cloanable-funds\u201d model\u2014a model Keynes explicitly rejected for short-run analysis.  Keynes\u2019s innovation was to show that money-holders demand a premium (the interest rate) for giving up liquidity.  That *is* what he \u201cposited was an influence on the rate of interest.\u201d\n\nConclusion: Debater A\u2019s appeal to S=I mistakes an equilibrium identity for the driving force of rates.  Keynes himself makes clear that the *cause* of the interest rate is liquidity preference\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless sufficiently compensated.
