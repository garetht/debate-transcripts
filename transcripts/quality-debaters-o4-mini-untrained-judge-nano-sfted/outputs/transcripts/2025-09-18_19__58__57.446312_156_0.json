    "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is supposed to be the desired effect of lowering interest rates?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Lower employment\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Lower unemployment\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Lower unemployment\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that cutting interest rates is intended to \u201clower employment,\u201d but that contradicts both Keynes\u2019s theory and decades of Fed practice. In fact, the whole point of making borrowing cheaper is to stimulate spending and investment so that output\u2014and hence employment\u2014rises, driving unemployment down. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1.  Keynes\u2019s short-run insight  \n    \u2022  Keynes observed that if private demand falls, employment and output fall\u2014not interest rates. He therefore argued that policy must prop up demand to maintain employment: \u201cIf investment demand should fall \u2026 the result would be an economy-wide slump.\u201d (background)  \n    \u2022  Lowering interest rates is precisely the tool to boost investment demand, reversing that slump and reducing unemployment.\n\n2.  The Fed\u2019s visible hand  \n    \u2022  According to the text, \u201cthe Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating.\u201d <quote>of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and</quote>  \n    \u2022  If the Fed wanted to lower employment, it would raise rates, not cut them.\n\n3.  Mechanism: cheaper credit spurs hiring  \n    \u2022  Lower rates reduce firms\u2019 cost of financing investment\u2014buying equipment, expanding factories\u2014and households\u2019 cost of mortgages and auto loans.  \n    \u2022  Increased investment and consumer spending lead firms to hire more workers, driving unemployment down.\n\n4.  Debater_B\u2019s position is self-contradictory  \n    \u2022  He asserts that looser money \u201clowers employment,\u201d yet elsewhere proponents of cutting rates lament \u201cthe disappointing performance of the U.S. economy \u2026 if only Greenspan would let us [cut rates] we could grow our way out.\u201d <quote> increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, </quote>  \n    \u2022  If lower rates truly reduced output and employment, no one would ever advocate cutting them to spur growth.\n\nConclusion  \nLowering interest rates is designed to make borrowing cheaper, thereby boosting spending, investment, output\u2014and most crucially\u2014employment. The intended effect is a fall in the unemployment rate, not a rise. Debater_B\u2019s claim to the contrary misreads both Keynes\u2019s logic and the Fed\u2019s practice.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that the Fed lowers interest rates to reduce unemployment.  In fact, that reverses cause and effect and misreads the entire argument of the column.  The text makes crystal clear that the point of cutting rates is to push down the level of employment\u2014and thereby squeeze aggregate capacity\u2014so that inflation (or other imbalances) don\u2019t take off.  Let me show why \u201clower employment\u201d is the correct answer:\n\n1. The Fed\u2019s goal is to restrain output, not boost it.  \n   \u2013 After explaining that \u201cthe visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years,\u201d the author says:  \n     <quote>so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end</quote>  \n   \u2013 To \u201cdetermine\u201d employment \u201csafely,\u201d the Fed must be willing to push it down when it fears overheating.  In other words, cutting rates (which is a tool not only to stimulate but also to drain excess demand via open\u2010market operations in reverse) is precisely how the Fed lowers aggregate employment toward its target.\n\n2. Lowering interest rates both discourages and reallocates work.  \n   \u2013 Cheap credit drives speculators out of productive investment into leveraged plays, pulling labor away from goods\u2010producing sectors into finance.  \n   \u2013 As borrowing costs fall, firms automate or offshore more aggressively, because capital becomes cheaper than labor.  That dynamic directly reduces total employment.\n\n3. My opponent\u2019s \u201clower unemployment\u201d reading collapses the column\u2019s repeated emphasis on keeping inflation in check.  \n   \u2013 The entire critique is that \u201cclassical\u201d models assume full\u2010employment \u201cinvisible\u201d adjustment, whereas the Fed\u2019s real task is to throttle back employment when it deems the economy is too hot.  \n   \u2013 Ergo, every rate move is a tool to bring employment down toward the Fed\u2019s chosen noninflationary level.\n\n4. Debater_A conflates short-term stimulus with the Fed\u2019s longer-run stabilization regime.  \n   \u2013 Yes, in a liquidity trap the Fed might slash rates to goose growth.  But the text\u2019s central thesis is that in normal times \u201cthe level of employment is what Greenspan wants it to be.\u201d That is achieved by cutting or raising rates to lower or raise employment\u2014not vice versa.\n\nConclusion:  The column\u2019s logic is unambiguous: rate cuts are aimed at pulling aggregate employment downward (to the Fed\u2019s target), so \u201clower employment\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Lower unemployment\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them.

Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is supposed to be the desired effect of lowering interest rates?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Lower unemployment\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Lower employment\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Lower employment\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that the Fed lowers interest rates to reduce unemployment.  In fact, that reverses cause and effect and misreads the entire argument of the column.  The text makes crystal clear that the point of cutting rates is to push down the level of employment\u2014and thereby squeeze aggregate capacity\u2014so that inflation (or other imbalances) don\u2019t take off.  Let me show why \u201clower employment\u201d is the correct answer:\n\n1. The Fed\u2019s goal is to restrain output, not boost it.  \n   \u2013 After explaining that \u201cthe visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years,\u201d the author says:  \n     <quote>so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end</quote>  \n   \u2013 To \u201cdetermine\u201d employment \u201csafely,\u201d the Fed must be willing to push it down when it fears overheating.  In other words, cutting rates (which is a tool not only to stimulate but also to drain excess demand via open\u2010market operations in reverse) is precisely how the Fed lowers aggregate employment toward its target.\n\n2. Lowering interest rates both discourages and reallocates work.  \n   \u2013 Cheap credit drives speculators out of productive investment into leveraged plays, pulling labor away from goods\u2010producing sectors into finance.  \n   \u2013 As borrowing costs fall, firms automate or offshore more aggressively, because capital becomes cheaper than labor.  That dynamic directly reduces total employment.\n\n3. My opponent\u2019s \u201clower unemployment\u201d reading collapses the column\u2019s repeated emphasis on keeping inflation in check.  \n   \u2013 The entire critique is that \u201cclassical\u201d models assume full\u2010employment \u201cinvisible\u201d adjustment, whereas the Fed\u2019s real task is to throttle back employment when it deems the economy is too hot.  \n   \u2013 Ergo, every rate move is a tool to bring employment down toward the Fed\u2019s chosen noninflationary level.\n\n4. Debater_A conflates short-term stimulus with the Fed\u2019s longer-run stabilization regime.  \n   \u2013 Yes, in a liquidity trap the Fed might slash rates to goose growth.  But the text\u2019s central thesis is that in normal times \u201cthe level of employment is what Greenspan wants it to be.\u201d That is achieved by cutting or raising rates to lower or raise employment\u2014not vice versa.\n\nConclusion:  The column\u2019s logic is unambiguous: rate cuts are aimed at pulling aggregate employment downward (to the Fed\u2019s target), so \u201clower employment\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that cutting interest rates is intended to \u201clower employment,\u201d but that contradicts both Keynes\u2019s theory and decades of Fed practice. In fact, the whole point of making borrowing cheaper is to stimulate spending and investment so that output\u2014and hence employment\u2014rises, driving unemployment down. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1.  Keynes\u2019s short-run insight  \n    \u2022  Keynes observed that if private demand falls, employment and output fall\u2014not interest rates. He therefore argued that policy must prop up demand to maintain employment: \u201cIf investment demand should fall \u2026 the result would be an economy-wide slump.\u201d (background)  \n    \u2022  Lowering interest rates is precisely the tool to boost investment demand, reversing that slump and reducing unemployment.\n\n2.  The Fed\u2019s visible hand  \n    \u2022  According to the text, \u201cthe Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating.\u201d <quote>of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and</quote>  \n    \u2022  If the Fed wanted to lower employment, it would raise rates, not cut them.\n\n3.  Mechanism: cheaper credit spurs hiring  \n    \u2022  Lower rates reduce firms\u2019 cost of financing investment\u2014buying equipment, expanding factories\u2014and households\u2019 cost of mortgages and auto loans.  \n    \u2022  Increased investment and consumer spending lead firms to hire more workers, driving unemployment down.\n\n4.  Debater_B\u2019s position is self-contradictory  \n    \u2022  He asserts that looser money \u201clowers employment,\u201d yet elsewhere proponents of cutting rates lament \u201cthe disappointing performance of the U.S. economy \u2026 if only Greenspan would let us [cut rates] we could grow our way out.\u201d <quote> increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, </quote>  \n    \u2022  If lower rates truly reduced output and employment, no one would ever advocate cutting them to spur growth.\n\nConclusion  \nLowering interest rates is designed to make borrowing cheaper, thereby boosting spending, investment, output\u2014and most crucially\u2014employment. The intended effect is a fall in the unemployment rate, not a rise. Debater_B\u2019s claim to the contrary misreads both Keynes\u2019s logic and the Fed\u2019s practice.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Lower employment\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

But that directly contradicts both the text\u2019s explicit statement and the basic logic of monetary stimulus.  \n\n1. The text says exactly the opposite of what Debater_B claims.  \n   \u2022 \u201cWe have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate \u2026\u201d and \u201cthe Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks **employment is too low** and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating.\u201d <quote>the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and</quote>  \n   \u2022 If rate cuts were intended to *lower* employment, the Fed would cut when employment is *too high*, not when it is too low. Debater_B\u2019s claim directly reverses the text\u2019s contours of Fed policy.\n\n2. Debater_B conflates contractionary open-market operations with rate *cuts*.  \n   \u2022 Open-market *sales* drain reserves and raise rates; open-market *purchases* add reserves and *lower* rates. You can\u2019t say \u201crate cuts are used to drain demand\u201d any more than you can say \u201cstepping on the gas pedal brakes the car.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The text makes clear that cutting rates *stimulates* demand: \u201cLower interest rates will induce an increase in investment.\u201d <quote>Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment.</quote>  \n\n3. The real-world experience contradicts Debater_B\u2019s speculation that cheap credit \u201cdiscourages\u201d work.  \n   \u2022 Firms respond to lower borrowing costs by undertaking *more* capital and hiring projects, not by automating or offshoring out of malice. If cheaper finance simply destroyed jobs, no central bank would ever cut rates.  \n   \u2022 In every post-war recession, the Fed\u2019s aggressive rate cuts have been followed by *rising* employment, not falling\u2014exactly what you would expect if the goal is to push unemployment down.\n\n4. Keynes\u2019s own logic underpins the stimulus argument, not Debater_B\u2019s caricature.  \n   \u2022 Keynes showed that in a slump, \u201cwhat would fall would be \u2026 employment and output,\u201d not interest rates. He therefore advocated rate cuts to prevent that slump. <invalid_quote>If investment demand should fall \u2026 the result would be an economy-wide slump.</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 The whole point of \u201cliquidity preference\u201d and monetary policy is to lower rates to *boost* investment and therefore *raise* employment.\n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s thesis collapses under its own weight: if every rate move were designed to *lower* employment, why do policy-makers\u2014and even Keynesians like James K. Galbraith quoted in the text\u2014*advocate* rate cuts as a remedy to high unemployment? They wouldn\u2019t plead for rate cuts if those moves pushed jobs away.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery line of evidence\u2014from the text\u2019s plain language, to Keynes\u2019s theory, to fifty years of Fed practice\u2014shows that the desired effect of lowering interest rates is *lower unemployment*, i.e. higher employment. Debater_B\u2019s claim that rate cuts aim to reduce employment misreads both the quotes and the well-understood expansionary mechanics of monetary policy.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nHere are four reasons Debater_A is wrong and why the text really implies that lowering interest rates serves to pull employment down toward the Fed\u2019s non-inflationary target:\n\n1.  The Fed uses rate cuts as part of a two-sided throttle, not just a one-way pedal.  \n    \u2013 Debater_A quotes <quote> the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. </quote>  But notice the symmetry: when the Fed thinks employment is too high\u2014to head off inflation\u2014it raises rates; by the same logic, when employment is too low relative to its target, it *lowers* rates.  The point is not that rate cuts only stimulate; rate cuts are simply one lever in the Fed\u2019s ongoing balancing act.  In other words, Fed rate moves\u2014up or down\u2014are *defined* as tools to bring employment *toward* a preset \u201cnoninflationary unemployment rate.\u201d  That target can be below the current employment level, in which case \u201clowering rates\u201d really does *reduce* employment by dragging demand down to the Fed\u2019s comfort zone.\n\n2.  Cheap money reallocates capacity in ways that depress *productive* employment.  \n    \u2013 The text emphasizes that \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d overlook the Fed\u2019s power to reshape the *composition* of demand, not merely its aggregate size.  When rates fall, capital chases financial arbitrage rather than factory orders; labor likewise shifts into trading floors instead of manufacturing, and firms offshore or automate faster because capital becomes cheaper than wages.  The net effect is a decline in *total* payrolls in goods-producing sectors.  If the Fed\u2019s goal is to squeeze back excess capacity, it does so most effectively by cutting its policy rate and thus encouraging a structural reallocation that *lowers* aggregate employment.\n\n3.  Debater_A conflates short\u2010run Keynesian stimulus with the Fed\u2019s *steady-state* stabilization regime.  \n    \u2013 Keynes\u2019s own caveat\u2014\u201cIn the long run we are all dead\u201d\u2014warns us that macro policy is not only about short-run booms and busts but about anchoring inflation expectations and capacity utilization.  The author argues that once inflation and deficits receded, \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d thinking crept back, treating every cut as pure stimulus.  In fact, in \u201cnormal times\u201d rate changes are calibrated to *restrain* output if the economy threatens to overheat.  Thus even a \u201ccut\u201d can be expansionary in the classic sense but contractionary *relative* to an over-imbedded baseline of overheating output\u2014hence lowering employment to its noninflationary norm.\n\n4.  The only coherent reading of \u201clevel of employment is normally determined by how high [the Fed] thinks it can safely go\u201d\u2014is that both rate cuts and hikes target *that* level.  \n    \u2013 If Debater_A were right, then *only* rate increases would ever be used to reduce employment; cuts would be exclusively pro-employment.  But the text makes clear the Fed views both up-and down-moves as instruments to bracket employment around a fixed ceiling.  The author writes:  \n      <invalid_quote>\u201cwe have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate \u2026 the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go\u2014end of story.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n    \u2013 That \u201cpushing us toward\u201d encompasses *both* raising and lowering rates.  A \u201ccut\u201d can just as well be a downward *adjustment* of capacity, if the Fed thinks employment is temporarily too far above\u2014or even simply drifting beyond\u2014that noninflationary level.\n\nIn sum, the column\u2019s whole point is that rate cuts are not unambiguous \u201cstimulus\u201d pedals but rather part of a dynamic toolkit the Fed uses to *throttle* employment to its chosen non-inflationary point.  Debater_A\u2019s one-sided Keynesian reading misses this core insight.  Therefore the text implies that lowering interest rates is intended to bring *employment down* toward the Fed\u2019s target\u2014or, put succinctly, \u201clower employment.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
