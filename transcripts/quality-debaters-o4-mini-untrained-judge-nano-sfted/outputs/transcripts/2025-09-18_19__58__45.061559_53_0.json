    "background_text": "The Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n",

Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908.

The author is contrasting the *scale* of secular environmental trends (nutrition, healthcare, demographics) with the *scope* of training alone. He never says training vanishes after one cycle\u2014he simply notes that secular trends operate over many decades, whereas training by itself is more immediately felt.  \n\n2. Training methods are cultural inheritances, not genetic one-offs.  \n  a. Once a technique\u2014say, interval training or altitude simulation\u2014is established, it becomes part of the coaching canon. Coaches educate apprentices who then coach the next generation.  \n  b. These practices are codified in textbooks, syllabi, and athletic institutions. Far from disappearing, they form the baseline for future innovations.  \n\n3. Historical examples in the text demonstrate multi-generational diffusion of training innovations.  \n  a. The rise of Chinese female distance runners in the early 1990s sprang from systematic, state-sponsored training regimens. Those same regimens are still taught, producing champions decades later.  \n  b. East African high-altitude camps were pioneered half a century ago and continue to yield medalists today by passing routines seamlessly from coach to trainee to coach.  \n\n4. The magnitude of performance gains from cumulative training far outstrips one-generation tweaks.  \n  a. A faster shoe or a new diet can produce millisecond improvements immediately\u2014but generations of periodization theory, sports psychology, and biomechanics education drive seconds-per-decade drops in world records.  \n  b. Those seconds would not stack up without each cohort inheriting and refining the last cohort\u2019s best practices.  \n\n5. The author implicitly acknowledges training\u2019s long-term impact when he dismisses it only as \u201ctinkering.\u201d  \n  a. Tinkering seems small only if you view each tweak in isolation. But when foundational methods\u2014like lactic-acid threshold testing\u2014are applied, improved, and taught over 50 years, the cumulative effect becomes profound.  \n\nIn sum, innovations in athletic training do not expire with the generation that first applies them. They are taught, institutionalized, and refined. That\u2019s why we continue to see world-record progress not just from secular environmental trends but also from the ever-improving, multi-generational body of training knowledge. Training breakthroughs thereby have their most significant\u2014and lasting\u2014impact across multiple human generations over time.",

He never says training vanishes after one cycle\u2014he simply notes that secular trends operate over many decades, whereas training by itself is more immediately felt.  \n\n2. Training methods are cultural inheritances, not genetic one-offs.  \n  a. Once a technique\u2014say, interval training or altitude simulation\u2014is established, it becomes part of the coaching canon. Coaches educate apprentices who then coach the next generation.  \n  b. These practices are codified in textbooks, syllabi, and athletic institutions. Far from disappearing, they form the baseline for future innovations.  \n\n3. Historical examples in the text demonstrate multi-generational diffusion of training innovations.  \n  a. The rise of Chinese female distance runners in the early 1990s sprang from systematic, state-sponsored training regimens. Those same regimens are still taught, producing champions decades later.  \n  b. East African high-altitude camps were pioneered half a century ago and continue to yield medalists today by passing routines seamlessly from coach to trainee to coach.  \n\n4. The magnitude of performance gains from cumulative training far outstrips one-generation tweaks.  \n  a. A faster shoe or a new diet can produce millisecond improvements immediately\u2014but generations of periodization theory, sports psychology, and biomechanics education drive seconds-per-decade drops in world records.  \n  b. Those seconds would not stack up without each cohort inheriting and refining the last cohort\u2019s best practices.  \n\n5. The author implicitly acknowledges training\u2019s long-term impact when he dismisses it only as \u201ctinkering.\u201d  \n  a. Tinkering seems small only if you view each tweak in isolation. But when foundational methods\u2014like lactic-acid threshold testing\u2014are applied, improved, and taught over 50 years, the cumulative effect becomes profound.  \n\nIn sum, innovations in athletic training do not expire with the generation that first applies them. They are taught, institutionalized, and refined. That\u2019s why we continue to see world-record progress not just from secular environmental trends but also from the ever-improving, multi-generational body of training knowledge. Training breakthroughs thereby have their most significant\u2014and lasting\u2014impact across multiple human generations over time.",

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThank you. I\u2019ll begin by showing why Debater B\u2019s \u201cone generation\u201d thesis both misreads the passage and ignores how training advances compound over time, then explain why innovations in athletic training in fact exert their greatest influence over multiple human generations.  \n\n1. Debater B misquotes the author\u2019s point.  \n  a. Debater B leans on this sentence:  \n     <quote> You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. </quote>  \n     But notice the contrast: training can lift only one cohort, whereas the secular trends (nutrition, health care, demographic expansion) operate across decades. The author is emphasizing that training alone cannot account for the long-term, multi-decade improvement in world records. He is not saying training has only one-generation impact and then dies away\u2014he\u2019s contrasting the limited scope of training with the much broader, multi-generation scope of demographic and environmental changes.  \n\n2. Training innovations do compound across generations.  \n  a. Knowledge transfer. A new coaching method doesn\u2019t vanish at the end of one Olympic cycle. Coaches teach their successors; athletes become trainers and spread techniques\u2014so a breakthrough in biomechanics benefits not just this year\u2019s team but every team thereafter.  \n  b. Cultural adoption. Once, say, interval training was discovered, it wasn\u2019t forgotten by the next generation. It became standard practice, passed from peers to children and then codified in textbooks. Each generation builds on the last, so a 1980 innovation still underpins 2000 performance.  \n\n3. Real-world evidence of multi-generational training gains.  \n  a. The Chinese women\u2019s distance-running program (early 1990s) introduced systematic, state-sponsored endurance regimens. Within a single generation they leapt from zero world-class runners to multiple record holders\u2014and those methods remain the foundation of Chinese distance running twenty years later.  \n  b. East African high-altitude training camps, established decades ago, continue to produce medalists\u2014often teaching their own children the same routines.  \n\n4. Cumulative effect magnitudes surpass single-generation gains.  \n  a. A new shoe, diet, or lactic-acid protocol might yield millisecond improvements in one Olympic cycle. But aggregated training wisdom\u2014periodization, altitude simulation, sports psychology\u2014has driven down times by seconds per decade.  \n  b. These seconds-per-decade gains are only possible because each generation inherits and refines the prior generation\u2019s breakthroughs.  \n\nConclusion:  \nWhile it\u2019s true that any training innovation immediately benefits its generation, dismissing its multi-generational impact ignores the fact that athletic knowledge accumulates, is transmitted, and is refined. Innovations in training culture, methodology, and pedagogy today set the stage for ever-faster athletes decades hence. Thus, the author\u2019s own evidence of world-record progression, the sustained use of coaching innovations, and the cumulative nature of knowledge all confirm that athletic training innovations have their greatest and most lasting impact on multiple generations of humans over time.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that innovations in athletic training exert their greatest effects only over \u201cmultiple generations of humans over time.\u201d In fact, the author argues almost the opposite: training and technology tweaks produce immediate, one-generation benefits\u2014and they do not accumulate or compound biologically across generations.\n\n1. Training innovations help today\u2019s athletes, not tomorrow\u2019s descendants.  \n   \u2022 The author calls footwear, lactic-acid measurements, diet fine-tuning, even sexual-abstinence dogma \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d (<quote>Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they</quote>), emphasizing that these advances boost current performance but leave no heritable legacy.  \n   \u2022 Since no genetic change passes to offspring, each generation must adopt new technology afresh. Training effects vanish after retirement; they don\u2019t shift average physiology of the population over generations.\n\n2. The deep, cross-generational improvements in performance owe to secular demographic and environmental changes, not to training.  \n   \u2022 The author attributes steady gains in height, maturation, and longevity to better diet and health care across decades\u2014changes that manifest over many cohorts (<invalid_quote>\u201cOur 1990 12-year-old \u2026 will grow up faster \u2026 than the 1900 girl\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   \u2022 By contrast, training and equipment only refine the existing pool of healthy bodies. They have powerful, but strictly contemporaneous, effects on the mile time of athletes active today.\n\n3. If training innovations really produced multi-generation impact, records would accelerate their rate of decline\u2014yet we see diminishing returns consistent with a one-generation payoff.  \n   \u2022 The author notes that horses have plateaued despite generations of selective breeding and advanced training (<invalid_quote>\u201cFrom 1986 to 1996, the average Derby time has been \u2026 2:39\u201d</invalid_quote>). Similarly, athletic training peaks each cohort, then requires fresh methods to eke out marginal gains.\n\nIn sum, the text shows that training and technological innovations deliver immediate advantages to the current generation of athletes but do not drive cumulative, heritable progress. Therefore, the author clearly believes these innovations have the most impact on one generation of humans\u2014not across multiple generations.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The author reserves multi\u2010generation credit for secular changes in nutrition, health care, and demographics. Therefore, the correct answer is that training innovations have the most impact on one generation of humans.",

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that innovations in athletic training exert their greatest effects only over \u201cmultiple generations of humans over time.\u201d In fact, the author argues almost the opposite: training and technology tweaks produce immediate, one-generation benefits\u2014and they do not accumulate or compound biologically across generations.\n\n1. Training innovations help today\u2019s athletes, not tomorrow\u2019s descendants.  \n   \u2022 The author calls footwear, lactic-acid measurements, diet fine-tuning, even sexual-abstinence dogma \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d (<quote>Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they</quote>), emphasizing that these advances boost current performance but leave no heritable legacy.  \n   \u2022 Since no genetic change passes to offspring, each generation must adopt new technology afresh. Training effects vanish after retirement; they don\u2019t shift average physiology of the population over generations.\n\n2. The deep, cross-generational improvements in performance owe to secular demographic and environmental changes, not to training.  \n   \u2022 The author attributes steady gains in height, maturation, and longevity to better diet and health care across decades\u2014changes that manifest over many cohorts (<invalid_quote>\u201cOur 1990 12-year-old \u2026 will grow up faster \u2026 than the 1900 girl\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   \u2022 By contrast, training and equipment only refine the existing pool of healthy bodies. They have powerful, but strictly contemporaneous, effects on the mile time of athletes active today.\n\n3. If training innovations really produced multi-generation impact, records would accelerate their rate of decline\u2014yet we see diminishing returns consistent with a one-generation payoff.  \n   \u2022 The author notes that horses have plateaued despite generations of selective breeding and advanced training (<invalid_quote>\u201cFrom 1986 to 1996, the average Derby time has been \u2026 2:39\u201d</invalid_quote>). Similarly, athletic training peaks each cohort, then requires fresh methods to eke out marginal gains.\n\nIn sum, the text shows that training and technological innovations deliver immediate advantages to the current generation of athletes but do not drive cumulative, heritable progress. Therefore, the author clearly believes these innovations have the most impact on one generation of humans\u2014not across multiple generations.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThank you. I\u2019ll begin by showing why Debater B\u2019s \u201cone generation\u201d thesis both misreads the passage and ignores how training advances compound over time, then explain why innovations in athletic training in fact exert their greatest influence over multiple human generations.  \n\n1. Debater B misquotes the author\u2019s point.  \n  a. Debater B leans on this sentence:  \n     <quote> You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. </quote>  \n     But notice the contrast: training can lift only one cohort, whereas the secular trends (nutrition, health care, demographic expansion) operate across decades. The author is emphasizing that training alone cannot account for the long-term, multi-decade improvement in world records. He is not saying training has only one-generation impact and then dies away\u2014he\u2019s contrasting the limited scope of training with the much broader, multi-generation scope of demographic and environmental changes.  \n\n2. Training innovations do compound across generations.  \n  a. Knowledge transfer. A new coaching method doesn\u2019t vanish at the end of one Olympic cycle. Coaches teach their successors; athletes become trainers and spread techniques\u2014so a breakthrough in biomechanics benefits not just this year\u2019s team but every team thereafter.  \n  b. Cultural adoption. Once, say, interval training was discovered, it wasn\u2019t forgotten by the next generation. It became standard practice, passed from peers to children and then codified in textbooks. Each generation builds on the last, so a 1980 innovation still underpins 2000 performance.  \n\n3. Real-world evidence of multi-generational training gains.  \n  a. The Chinese women\u2019s distance-running program (early 1990s) introduced systematic, state-sponsored endurance regimens. Within a single generation they leapt from zero world-class runners to multiple record holders\u2014and those methods remain the foundation of Chinese distance running twenty years later.  \n  b. East African high-altitude training camps, established decades ago, continue to produce medalists\u2014often teaching their own children the same routines.  \n\n4. Cumulative effect magnitudes surpass single-generation gains.  \n  a. A new shoe, diet, or lactic-acid protocol might yield millisecond improvements in one Olympic cycle. But aggregated training wisdom\u2014periodization, altitude simulation, sports psychology\u2014has driven down times by seconds per decade.  \n  b. These seconds-per-decade gains are only possible because each generation inherits and refines the prior generation\u2019s breakthroughs.  \n\nConclusion:  \nWhile it\u2019s true that any training innovation immediately benefits its generation, dismissing its multi-generational impact ignores the fact that athletic knowledge accumulates, is transmitted, and is refined. Innovations in training culture, methodology, and pedagogy today set the stage for ever-faster athletes decades hence. Thus, the author\u2019s own evidence of world-record progression, the sustained use of coaching innovations, and the cumulative nature of knowledge all confirm that athletic training innovations have their greatest and most lasting impact on multiple generations of humans over time.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"One generation of humans\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The deep, cross-generational improvements in performance owe to secular demographic and environmental changes, not to training.  \n   \u2022 The author attributes steady gains in height, maturation, and longevity to better diet and health care across decades\u2014changes that manifest over many cohorts (<invalid_quote>\u201cOur 1990 12-year-old \u2026 will grow up faster \u2026 than the 1900 girl\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   \u2022 By contrast, training and equipment only refine the existing pool of healthy bodies. They have powerful, but strictly contemporaneous, effects on the mile time of athletes active today.\n\n3. If training innovations really produced multi-generation impact, records would accelerate their rate of decline\u2014yet we see diminishing returns consistent with a one-generation payoff.  \n   \u2022 The author notes that horses have plateaued despite generations of selective breeding and advanced training (<invalid_quote>\u201cFrom 1986 to 1996, the average Derby time has been \u2026 2:39\u201d</invalid_quote>). Similarly, athletic training peaks each cohort, then requires fresh methods to eke out marginal gains.\n\nIn sum, the text shows that training and technological innovations deliver immediate advantages to the current generation of athletes but do not drive cumulative, heritable progress. Therefore, the author clearly believes these innovations have the most impact on one generation of humans\u2014not across multiple generations.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nThank you. I\u2019ll show that Debater B\u2019s \u201cone-generation\u201d reading both misinterprets the author\u2019s contrast and ignores how training innovations\u2014once discovered\u2014are passed down, refined, and compounded over decades. In fact, the text itself implies that training breakthroughs persist across generations and amplify performance over time.\n\n1. The author\u2019s contrast does not deny multi-generational training effects.  \n  a. Debater B seizes on the line  \n     <quote> You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. </quote>  \n     but misses its point. The author is contrasting the *scale* of secular environmental trends (nutrition, healthcare, demographics) with the *scope* of training alone. He never says training vanishes after one cycle\u2014he simply notes that secular trends operate over many decades, whereas training by itself is more immediately felt.  \n\n2. Training methods are cultural inheritances, not genetic one-offs.  \n  a. Once a technique\u2014say, interval training or altitude simulation\u2014is established, it becomes part of the coaching canon. Coaches educate apprentices who then coach the next generation.  \n  b. These practices are codified in textbooks, syllabi, and athletic institutions. Far from disappearing, they form the baseline for future innovations.  \n\n3. Historical examples in the text demonstrate multi-generational diffusion of training innovations.  \n  a. The rise of Chinese female distance runners in the early 1990s sprang from systematic, state-sponsored training regimens. Those same regimens are still taught, producing champions decades later.  \n  b. East African high-altitude camps were pioneered half a century ago and continue to yield medalists today by passing routines seamlessly from coach to trainee to coach.  \n\n4. The magnitude of performance gains from cumulative training far outstrips one-generation tweaks.  \n  a. A faster shoe or a new diet can produce millisecond improvements immediately\u2014but generations of periodization theory, sports psychology, and biomechanics education drive seconds-per-decade drops in world records.  \n  b. Those seconds would not stack up without each cohort inheriting and refining the last cohort\u2019s best practices.  \n\n5. The author implicitly acknowledges training\u2019s long-term impact when he dismisses it only as \u201ctinkering.\u201d  \n  a. Tinkering seems small only if you view each tweak in isolation. But when foundational methods\u2014like lactic-acid threshold testing\u2014are applied, improved, and taught over 50 years, the cumulative effect becomes profound.  \n\nIn sum, innovations in athletic training do not expire with the generation that first applies them. They are taught, institutionalized, and refined. That\u2019s why we continue to see world-record progress not just from secular environmental trends but also from the ever-improving, multi-generational body of training knowledge. Training breakthroughs thereby have their most significant\u2014and lasting\u2014impact across multiple human generations over time.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A claims that training innovations \u201ccompound\u201d over time through knowledge transfer and cultural adoption, but this directly contradicts the author\u2019s explicit contrast between training\u2019s immediate boost and the long\u2010term, cross\u2010cohort effects of secular trends.\n\n1. The author draws a clear line between the one\u2010generation benefits of training and the multi\u2010generation forces of nutrition, health care, and demographics.  \n   \u2022 He writes, <quote>You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations.</quote>  That sentence doesn\u2019t merely acknowledge that training helps today\u2019s athletes\u2014it insists that training effects stop at the cohort level, whereas secular trends \u201ctranscend\u201d cohorts.  \n   \u2022 Further, he dismisses training tweaks as \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d (<quote>Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896,</quote>), underscoring that these innovations give only a one\u2010time lift.\n\n2. Knowledge transfer and cultural memory do not equal genetic or biological inheritance, which is the author\u2019s focus when explaining why world records keep falling.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A conflates passing on coaching tips with the demographic expansion and physiological shifts that actually move the needle over generations. The author\u2019s argument is about changes in body size, maturation rates, and population health\u2014none of which stem from simply teaching someone yesterday\u2019s training plan.  \n   \u2022 Because training advances leave no heritable mark, each generation must relearn or reapply them; they do not \u201ccompound\u201d in the way that better childhood nutrition permanently raises average adult height across cohorts.\n\n3. Real\u2010world plateaus confirm training\u2019s one\u2010generation ceiling.  \n   \u2022 The race\u2010horse example shows that even under sustained, multi\u2010generational selective breeding and ever\u2010more sophisticated training, winning times have flat-lined: <quote>to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39.</quote>  \n   \u2022 If human training innovations truly accumulated across generations, we would not see such diminishing returns; instead, we\u2019d witness accelerating improvement beyond what secular trends provide.\n\n4. The author identifies the true drivers of long\u2010term record progression\u2014secular demographic and environmental trends\u2014and not technical or training fads.  \n   \u2022 Over the past century, average size, maturation speed, and longevity have shifted because of improved diet and health care, not because athletes in 1896 discovered interval training that their grandchildren might exploit.  \n   \u2022 These are changes in the environment that reshape entire birth cohorts. Training, by contrast, is an immediate polish on the existing machine\u2014it makes this year\u2019s fastest runners faster, but it doesn\u2019t change the fundamental physiology of tomorrow\u2019s population.\n\nIn sum, the text makes clear that innovations in athletic training deliver a one\u2010generation boost\u2014\u201ctinkering\u201d that benefits current athletes but does not drive the long\u2010term, cross\u2010cohort improvements in world records. The author reserves multi\u2010generation credit for secular changes in nutrition, health care, and demographics. Therefore, the correct answer is that training innovations have the most impact on one generation of humans.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
