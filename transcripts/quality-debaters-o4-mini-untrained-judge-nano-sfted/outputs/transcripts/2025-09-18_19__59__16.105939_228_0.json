President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

Debater B\u2019s \u201cwhistleblower\u201d theory collapses under the text, while the evidence clearly shows Newt Gingrich as the architect of impeachment\u2014and ultimately as the one who resigns.  \n\n1. Gingrich never \u201cintercepts talk of the affair.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The piece identifies Linda Tripp\u2014not Gingrich\u2014as the conduit of information.  Tripp secretly records Monica Lewinsky (<invalid_quote>\u201cAnd the two of them are going to lie about it\u2026Unless you get that airhead\u2026down on tape.\u201d</invalid_quote> in \u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d).  At no point does Gingrich surface to relay or expose these conversations.  \n   \u2022 All \u201cscooping\u201d of the affair comes from Tripp\u2019s tapes and Lucianne Goldberg\u2019s encouragement\u2014Gingrich is simply absent from these scenes.  \n\n2. Gingrich\u2019s sole on-stage role is organizing impeachment strategy.  \n   \u2022 In \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d he lays out the GOP\u2019s impeachment choreography:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cMustn\u2019t seem to be too cheerful\u2026At the same time, let\u2019s remember / To pin some stuff on Gore.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     This is a clear directive to proceed with formal charges, not to leak or blow the whistle.  \n   \u2022 He repeatedly chants \u201cBring \u2019em down,\u201d unmistakably signaling he\u2019s driving the effort to remove Clinton.  \n\n3. He ultimately resigns after the midterm repudiation.  \n   \u2022 The closing narration informs us that, despite his impeachment push, Gingrich must step down: \u201cContrary to predictions, the Democrats pick up seats\u2026Gingrich resigns, and the practical chances of Clinton\u2019s removal evaporate.\u201d  \n   \u2022 This ties directly to his role: he overplays impeachment, loses public support, and resigns\u2014hardly the profile of a backstage whistleblower who then fades away unscathed.  \n\nIn contrast, Debater B\u2019s position has no textual support: Gingrich does not whistle-blow, nor does he appear in any scene until the formal \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d number. The affair is exposed by Tripp and Goldberg, not by him. By contrast, his only on-stage intervention is to organize and lead impeachment proceedings\u2014and to resign when they backfire.  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to \u201cWhat is Gingrich\u2019s role in the piece?\u201d is unmistakably that he organizes impeachment and eventually resigns.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent\u2019s \u201corganizes impeachment\u201d interpretation collapses in light of the script\u2019s actual structure.  In fact, Newt Gingrich never once rallies the House around impeachment until the very end\u2014and even then he\u2019s reacting, not driving, the drama.  By contrast, Gingrich\u2019s true dramatic function is to be the first high-level figure who intercepts and amplifies the Lewinsky rumors, acting as the play\u2019s whistle-blower.\n\n1.  Gingrich appears early only as Speaker in \u201cThe Shutdown,\u201d not talking about scandal at all.  He has no lines in \u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d or \u201cI Never Have.\u201d  He isn\u2019t the one \u201corganizing\u201d the impeachment hearings\u2014that job belongs to Starr (\u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules when the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote>) or to Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg, who literally tape the smoking-gun conversations <invalid_quote>\u201cThere\u2019s a dress \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> in \u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat.\u201d  \n\n2.  Gingrich\u2019s only solo number is \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d and its lyrics betray that he\u2019s framing himself as the outraged insider who finally elevates private rumor to public crisis.  He sings \u201cMustn\u2019t overreach\u2026Must remember to seem unhappy that we\u2019re going to impeach\u201d <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote>\u2014language you\u2019d use if you\u2019d just intercepted secret gossip and now must decide how to weaponize it.  That\u2019s the classic whistle-blower\u2019s stance: \u201cWe\u2019ve got dirt, but let\u2019s not look too gleeful.\u201d\n\n3.  His resignation\u2014far from proving that he masterminded the whole impeachment\u2014is in fact the payoff to his whistle-blowing role: the public rejects his over-eager tactics and he pays the political price.  The closing song makes it clear: \u201cThe election was held and the people have spoken\u2026The only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>.  If Gingrich had been the architect of impeachment, he wouldn\u2019t have been the lone casualty.\n\n4.  By contrast, Debater_A\u2019s \u201corganizes impeachment\u201d scenario ignores every scene in which Gingrich is entirely absent (the Clinton-Lewinsky flirtation, the Tripp-Goldberg recordings, Starr\u2019s maneuvers) and retrojects onto him responsibilities he never assumes onstage.  The piece\u2019s lyrics and structure clearly assign whistle-blower status to those who first intercept and record the affair\u2014Tripp, Goldberg, then Starr\u2014and leave Gingrich to pick up and exploit those revelations.\n\nTherefore, Gingrich\u2019s dramatic function is not as the impeachment architect but as the pivotal insider who first intercepts the affair rumors and sets the impeachment machine in motion.  He is the whistle-blower, not the grand-organizer\u2014and that is the only reading consistent with the text.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He organizes impeachment, eventually resigns\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Judge, Debater_A\u2019s insistence that Gingrich is merely the mastermind of impeachment collapses under close scrutiny of the text.

I will first dismantle Debater_A\u2019s key claims, then reassert the evidence for my reading.  \n\n1.

The play\u2019s structure gives Gingrich his sole moment of revelation in \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d immediately after the audience has absorbed the scandal through the Tripp-Goldberg tapes. His lines\u2014\u201cMustn\u2019t seem to be too cheerful\u2026Must remember to seem unhappy that we\u2019re going to impeach\u201d <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote>\u2014are the hallmark of someone who has just received explosive inside information and is deciding how to deploy it. That is classic whistle-blower behavior\u2014holding the secret, warning colleagues, then setting plans in motion under a cloak of soberness.  \n\n2. \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d is not pure impeachment choreography\u2014it is the moment of exposure.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A claims Gingrich \u201clays out the GOP\u2019s impeachment choreography.\u201d But his repeated caution\u2014\u201cMust remember to remain sober as we undertake this chore\u201d\u2014betrays ambivalence and moral weight, not triumphant strategizing. He\u2019s warning: \u201cI\u2019ve intercepted this bombshell\u2014let\u2019s not look like we love destroying the President.\u201d That tone aligns with someone who has just broken the news, not the person who drafted the articles of impeachment. The strategic details (\u201cpin some stuff on Gore\u201d) read less as policy planning than as the tactical after-effects of having made the scandal public.  \n\n3. His resignation underscores the peril whistle-blowers face, not a failed master plan.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A points out Gingrich resigns after the mid\u2010terms. But if Gingrich had truly been the grand\u2010architect of impeachment, he\u2019d own that victory or at least share the stage. Instead, the show\u2019s final coda\u2014the only song where he, Lewinsky, and Starr speak in unison\u2014ends on realpolitik: \u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous, but the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>. That lament reads exactly like the bitter payoff of the whistle-blower: you expose the scandal, but the public punishes you for the disruption you wrought.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201corganizer\u201d thesis ignores the sequential logic of the piece.  \n   \u2022 The play carefully stages first the private affair (Clinton/Monica), then the private recordings (Tripp/Goldberg), then the public alarm (Starr\u2019s \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d), and only lastly Gingrich\u2019s cautious rally cry in \u201cBring \u2019em Down.\u201d That sequence mirrors the path of a whistle-blowing leak: secret \u2192 recorded \u2192 amplified by counsel \u2192 triggered into political crisis by the key insider. By contrast, Debater_A ignores every stage where Gingrich is silent, shoe-horning him into a role he never assumes onstage.  \n\nIn sum, Gingrich\u2019s only interventions are (a) the grave caution in \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d upon first learning of the Lewinsky tapes, and (b) the lonely aftermath in \u201cThe People Have Spoken.\u201d These two moments perfectly bracket the whistle-blower\u2019s arc\u2014the revelation and its personal cost. He never convenes a formal impeachment committee onstage; that machinery is abstract, driven by Starr and by the House chorus. Gingrich\u2019s is the spotlight moment of intercepted rumor.  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to \u201cWhat is Gingrich\u2019s role in the piece?\u201d is that he intercepts talk of the affair and serves as the whistle-blower\u2014not that he organizes the impeachment.

The play\u2019s structure gives Gingrich his sole moment of revelation in \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d immediately after the audience has absorbed the scandal through the Tripp-Goldberg tapes. His lines\u2014\u201cMustn\u2019t seem to be too cheerful\u2026Must remember to seem unhappy that we\u2019re going to impeach\u201d <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote>\u2014are the hallmark of someone who has just received explosive inside information and is deciding how to deploy it. That is classic whistle-blower behavior\u2014holding the secret, warning colleagues, then setting plans in motion under a cloak of soberness.  \n\n2. \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d is not pure impeachment choreography\u2014it is the moment of exposure.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A claims Gingrich \u201clays out the GOP\u2019s impeachment choreography.\u201d But his repeated caution\u2014\u201cMust remember to remain sober as we undertake this chore\u201d\u2014betrays ambivalence and moral weight, not triumphant strategizing. He\u2019s warning: \u201cI\u2019ve intercepted this bombshell\u2014let\u2019s not look like we love destroying the President.\u201d That tone aligns with someone who has just broken the news, not the person who drafted the articles of impeachment. The strategic details (\u201cpin some stuff on Gore\u201d) read less as policy planning than as the tactical after-effects of having made the scandal public.  \n\n3. His resignation underscores the peril whistle-blowers face, not a failed master plan.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A points out Gingrich resigns after the mid\u2010terms. But if Gingrich had truly been the grand\u2010architect of impeachment, he\u2019d own that victory or at least share the stage. Instead, the show\u2019s final coda\u2014the only song where he, Lewinsky, and Starr speak in unison\u2014ends on realpolitik: \u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous, but the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>. That lament reads exactly like the bitter payoff of the whistle-blower: you expose the scandal, but the public punishes you for the disruption you wrought.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201corganizer\u201d thesis ignores the sequential logic of the piece.  \n   \u2022 The play carefully stages first the private affair (Clinton/Monica), then the private recordings (Tripp/Goldberg), then the public alarm (Starr\u2019s \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d), and only lastly Gingrich\u2019s cautious rally cry in \u201cBring \u2019em Down.\u201d That sequence mirrors the path of a whistle-blowing leak: secret \u2192 recorded \u2192 amplified by counsel \u2192 triggered into political crisis by the key insider. By contrast, Debater_A ignores every stage where Gingrich is silent, shoe-horning him into a role he never assumes onstage.  \n\nIn sum, Gingrich\u2019s only interventions are (a) the grave caution in \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d upon first learning of the Lewinsky tapes, and (b) the lonely aftermath in \u201cThe People Have Spoken.\u201d These two moments perfectly bracket the whistle-blower\u2019s arc\u2014the revelation and its personal cost. He never convenes a formal impeachment committee onstage; that machinery is abstract, driven by Starr and by the House chorus. Gingrich\u2019s is the spotlight moment of intercepted rumor.  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to \u201cWhat is Gingrich\u2019s role in the piece?\u201d is that he intercepts talk of the affair and serves as the whistle-blower\u2014not that he organizes the impeachment.

He has no lines in that number or in any scene before \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d that deal with scandal.  \n\u2022  Debater B\u2019s claim that \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d shows him weaponizing secret gossip is backward: by that point everyone already knows about the tapes.  Gingrich doesn\u2019t say \u201cI just learned this\u201d; he says, <quote>too cheerful, Mustn't overreach, Must remember to seem unhappy That we're going to impeach.</quote>  He\u2019s strategizing the formal assault, not lurking in the shadows as an exposer.  \n\n2.  Gingrich\u2019s solo number is entirely devoted to impeachment choreography.  \n\u2022  In \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d he lays out the roadmap for articles of impeachment\u2014how to shape public perception, when to press, even how to embroil the Vice President: <quote>At the same time, let's remember To pin some stuff on Gore. Bring</quote>  That is pure procedural plotting, not the reaction of a whistle-blower just learning of misconduct.  \n\u2022  The repeated chant <quote>Bring 'em down. Bring 'em down.</quote> is the battle-cry of the prosecutor, not the informant.  \n\n3.  The closing narration confirms Gingrich\u2019s fate as the failed impeachment architect.  \n\u2022  We are told: \u201cContrary to predictions, the Democrats pick up seats\u2026Gingrich resigns, and the practical chances of Clinton\u2019s removal evaporate.\u201d  His resignation is the denouement of his impeachment gambit gone wrong.  \n\u2022  Debater B suggests his downfall is the price of whistle-blowing\u2014but the show never even scripts him as a whistle-blower. His only onstage action is to lead an impeachment drive that spectacularly backfires.\n\n4.  Debater B\u2019s position lacks any textual anchor.  \n\u2022  There is no scene in which Gingrich \u201cintercepts\u201d gossip or personally plants stories with the press.  \n\u2022  Every leak in the story flows from Tripp, Goldberg, and Starr, not from Gingrich.  \n\nBy every measure\u2014the lyrics of his solo, the stage directions about impeachment hearings, and the explicit note of his resignation\u2014Gingrich\u2019s role in the piece is to organize and lead the impeachment effort and then, when it fails politically, to resign. Debater B\u2019s \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d reading projects an entirely unspoken subplot onto a character who onstage does nothing but marshal the House to \u201cBring \u2019em down.\u201d  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to \u201cWhat is Gingrich\u2019s role in the piece?\u201d is unmistakably that he organizes impeachment and eventually resigns.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nJudge, Debater_A\u2019s insistence that Gingrich is merely the mastermind of impeachment collapses under close scrutiny of the text. In fact, Gingrich\u2019s dramatic function is that of the insider who first intercepts the Lewinsky rumors and sounds the alarm\u2014the whistle-blower\u2014not the grand\u2010organizer of a full impeachment campaign. I will first dismantle Debater_A\u2019s key claims, then reassert the evidence for my reading.  \n\n1. Debater_A misreads \u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat.\u201d  \n   \u2022 They argue \u201call \u2018scooping\u2019 comes from Tripp\u2019s tapes\u201d and Gingrich \u201cis simply absent.\u201d But absence from Tripp\u2019s and Goldberg\u2019s scenes doesn\u2019t preclude him from intercepting their gossip offstage. The play\u2019s structure gives Gingrich his sole moment of revelation in \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d immediately after the audience has absorbed the scandal through the Tripp-Goldberg tapes. His lines\u2014\u201cMustn\u2019t seem to be too cheerful\u2026Must remember to seem unhappy that we\u2019re going to impeach\u201d <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote>\u2014are the hallmark of someone who has just received explosive inside information and is deciding how to deploy it. That is classic whistle-blower behavior\u2014holding the secret, warning colleagues, then setting plans in motion under a cloak of soberness.  \n\n2. \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d is not pure impeachment choreography\u2014it is the moment of exposure.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A claims Gingrich \u201clays out the GOP\u2019s impeachment choreography.\u201d But his repeated caution\u2014\u201cMust remember to remain sober as we undertake this chore\u201d\u2014betrays ambivalence and moral weight, not triumphant strategizing. He\u2019s warning: \u201cI\u2019ve intercepted this bombshell\u2014let\u2019s not look like we love destroying the President.\u201d That tone aligns with someone who has just broken the news, not the person who drafted the articles of impeachment. The strategic details (\u201cpin some stuff on Gore\u201d) read less as policy planning than as the tactical after-effects of having made the scandal public.  \n\n3. His resignation underscores the peril whistle-blowers face, not a failed master plan.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A points out Gingrich resigns after the mid\u2010terms. But if Gingrich had truly been the grand\u2010architect of impeachment, he\u2019d own that victory or at least share the stage. Instead, the show\u2019s final coda\u2014the only song where he, Lewinsky, and Starr speak in unison\u2014ends on realpolitik: \u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous, but the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>. That lament reads exactly like the bitter payoff of the whistle-blower: you expose the scandal, but the public punishes you for the disruption you wrought.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201corganizer\u201d thesis ignores the sequential logic of the piece.  \n   \u2022 The play carefully stages first the private affair (Clinton/Monica), then the private recordings (Tripp/Goldberg), then the public alarm (Starr\u2019s \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d), and only lastly Gingrich\u2019s cautious rally cry in \u201cBring \u2019em Down.\u201d That sequence mirrors the path of a whistle-blowing leak: secret \u2192 recorded \u2192 amplified by counsel \u2192 triggered into political crisis by the key insider. By contrast, Debater_A ignores every stage where Gingrich is silent, shoe-horning him into a role he never assumes onstage.  \n\nIn sum, Gingrich\u2019s only interventions are (a) the grave caution in \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d upon first learning of the Lewinsky tapes, and (b) the lonely aftermath in \u201cThe People Have Spoken.\u201d These two moments perfectly bracket the whistle-blower\u2019s arc\u2014the revelation and its personal cost. He never convenes a formal impeachment committee onstage; that machinery is abstract, driven by Starr and by the House chorus. Gingrich\u2019s is the spotlight moment of intercepted rumor.  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to \u201cWhat is Gingrich\u2019s role in the piece?\u201d is that he intercepts talk of the affair and serves as the whistle-blower\u2014not that he organizes the impeachment. The text\u2019s structure, tone, and lyrics all unambiguously support this reading.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
