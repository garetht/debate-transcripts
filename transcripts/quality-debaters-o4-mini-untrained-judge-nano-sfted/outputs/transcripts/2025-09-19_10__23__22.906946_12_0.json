{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 12, "background_text": "The Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it?

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The Public\u2019s Own Judgment  \n   \u2022 Slate reports Monica\u2019s favorability at 5 percent\u2014\u201cfantastically low\u201d and \u201cmuch lower than Clinton\u2019s.\u201d  That reflects broad popular conviction that she bears primary blame. <quote> One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). </quote>  \n   \u2022 By contrast, Clinton\u2019s public rating is higher (\u20136) than Monica\u2019s (\u20139), so the public already assigns her more fault.  \n\n2. Monica\u2019s Active Role in Exposing & Fueling the Scandal  \n   \u2022 She \u201cblabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair to lots of people,\u201d making the story possible and ensuring it spread. <quote> Blabbed her \"secret\" affair to lots of people. (So, while she was dragged into the scandal against her will, it was her own loquaciousness that made the dragging possible.) </quote>  \n   \u2022 Her willingness to shop her story for book deals and public attention shows she engaged in \u201cgossip and other people\u2019s distress\u201d for personal gain. <quote> Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. </quote>  \n\n3. Monica\u2019s Moral Agency  \n   \u2022 She was a capable adult, not a naive child: she \u201cprotected herself with immunity when she needed to, even though her testimony would do enormous harm to Clinton and the nation.\u201d <quote> Is a capable adult, not--as her advocates claim--a naive child, defenseless against the president's wiles. </quote>  \n   \u2022 She repeatedly lied, seduced a married man, and endangered the presidency \u201cfor the sake of casual sex.\u201d  \n\n4. Clinton\u2019s Secondary Liability  \n   \u2022 Yes, Clinton initiated the affair and abused power. But Slate\u2019s analysis explicitly assigns him a Slate rating of \u20139, whereas Monica also gets \u20139. Publicly, Monica polls worse.  \n   \u2022 More importantly, Clinton\u2019s cover-ups may have deepened the scandal\u2019s severity, but he always intended to conceal. Monica, in contrast, amplified it.  \n\nRebutting Debater_B\u2019s Clinton-centric claim:  \n   \u2022 Debater_B argues Clinton\u2019s perjury and obstruction \u201cmakes him most responsible.\u201d Yet Slate concedes that many were complicit\u2014Betty Currie, George Stephanopoulos, Linda Tripp, etc.\u2014but the public singles out Monica, not a web of enablers.  \n   \u2022 If Clinton alone were seen as responsible, his rating would be lower than Monica\u2019s. But the public\u2019s actual ratings show Monica is blamed more heavily.  \n   \u2022 Clinton\u2019s plusses (he \u201chas been persecuted by enemies\u201d <quote> Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. </quote>) earn him some sympathy that Monica does not receive.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The empirical data\u2014the public\u2019s own polling\u2014and Monica Lewinsky\u2019s decisive role in disseminating and profiting from the scandal make her, in the public\u2019s eyes, the person most responsible. Bill Clinton\u2019s misdeeds precipitated the affair but did not, by themselves, bring the scandal to light. Monica did. Therefore, the correct answer is Monica Lewinsky.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Statement:\n\n1. The public overwhelmingly sees President Clinton\u2014 not Monica Lewinsky\u2014 as the central malefactor.  Slate\u2019s own \u201cScorecard\u201d gives Clinton a rating of \u20139, compared to Monica\u2019s \u20132.  That gap reflects Clinton\u2019s far greater responsibility.\n\n2. Abuse of Power and Betrayal of Trust  \n  a. Clinton \u201chad an adulterous affair with a young intern\u201d and \u201clied about it to everyone\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses a\u2013b under Bill Clinton</invalid_quote>).  Monica was neither President nor holder of enormous public trust.  \n  b. He \u201cprobably perjured himself\u201d and \u201cperhaps obstructed justice\u201d (<quote>Minuses and</quote>), offenses far more serious than Monica\u2019s \u201clied frequently\u201d or \u201cblabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses c, f under Monica Lewinsky</invalid_quote>).  \n\n3. Coercion vs. Volition  \n  a. Monica was \u201cdragged into the scandal against her will\u201d and \u201csexually exploited by her older boss\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses a, d under Monica Lewinsky</invalid_quote>).  That underscores her role as a victim, not primary wrongdoer.  \n  b. Clinton, by contrast, chose his conduct repeatedly, then enlisted aides\u2014 from Betty Currie to George Stephanopoulos\u2014 to help cover it up.  \n\n4. Scale of Harm  \n  a. Clinton\u2019s actions \u201chumiliated his wife and daughter\u201d and \u201centangled allies and aides in his web of deceit\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses f\u2013e under Bill Clinton</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. Monica\u2019s misdeeds harmed her own reputation and perhaps the presidency, but she never had the power to \u201cpersecute\u201d anyone or provoke constitutional standoffs.  \n\n5. Public Ratings Confirm It  \n  a. Public rating for Clinton: \u20136.  Monica: \u20139.  But Slate\u2019s more deliberative ranking assigns Clinton \u20139 and Monica \u20132\u2014 acknowledging Monica\u2019s lesser moral and legal culpability.  \n\nIn sum, only Clinton combined the authority, intent, and cover-up to deserve being seen as the person most responsible.  Monica\u2019s faults\u2014 while real\u2014 pale before a president\u2019s abuse of office, lies under oath, and possible obstruction of justice.  Therefore, the correct answer is indisputably \u201cClinton.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Monica\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, the claim that \u201cMonica\u201d is the person most responsible for the scandal collapses under scrutiny. The public\u2019s perception of blame, as reflected in both hard polling and Slate\u2019s own moral \u201cScorecard,\u201d squarely points to President Bill Clinton\u2014not Monica Lewinsky\u2014as the central malefactor.\n\n1. Conflating Favorability with Blame  \n  Debater A repeatedly relies on Monica\u2019s abysmal 5 percent favorability (\u201cfantastically low\u201d) versus Clinton\u2019s \u201conly\u201d \u20136 public rating. But Slate\u2019s scale measures sympathy, not culpability. A low rating means little sympathy, not necessarily greatest blame. Slate makes this clear by assigning Clinton a Slate rating of \u20139\u2014its harshest judgment: <quote>He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9</quote>. Monica, by contrast, is rated \u20132: far more forgiving. If Slate believes Clinton \u201cdoesn't deserve\u201d sympathy more than anyone else, the public\u2019s moral judgment aligns with seeing Clinton as the prime wrongdoer.\n\n2. Agency, Authority, and Abuse of Power  \n  \u2022 Clinton \u201chad an adulterous affair with a young intern,\u201d \u201clied about it to everyone,\u201d <invalid_quote>Minuses a\u2013b under Bill Clinton</invalid_quote> and \u201cprobably perjured himself\u201d and \u201cperhaps obstructed justice\u201d (<quote>Minuses and</quote>).  \n  \u2022 Monica, in contrast, \u201cwas dragged into the scandal against her will\u201d and \u201csexually exploited by her older boss\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses a, d under Monica Lewinsky</invalid_quote>). That makes her victim more than villain.\n\n3. Who Spread the Scandal?  \n  Debater A blames Monica for \u201cblabbing\u201d and \u201cshopping\u201d her story, yet Slate singles out Linda Tripp, the media, and Clinton\u2019s own allies as the amplifiers. Monica told only a few confidants; it was Tripp who \u201cobsessively nosed into the private lives of others\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses b under Linda Tripp</invalid_quote>) and the press who \u201cworked hard to break a very important story\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses b under The Media</invalid_quote>). Monica\u2019s disclosures do not compare to a president\u2019s \u201centangling allies and aides in his web of deceit\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses e under Bill Clinton</invalid_quote>) or stirring a constitutional crisis.\n\n4. Scale of Harm and Responsibility  \n  Clinton\u2019s misconduct \u201chumiliated his wife and daughter\u201d and \u201centangled allies and aides in his web of deceit\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses f\u2013e under Bill Clinton</invalid_quote>). He alone wielded the power to lie under oath, misuse the legal system, and potentially obstruct justice. Monica\u2019s actions, while regrettable, lacked that institutional gravity.\n\n5. Public Consensus on Primary Blame  \n  Slate\u2019s unanimous \u20139 for Clinton is the single lowest rating on its entire Scorecard.

The public\u2019s perception of blame, as reflected in both hard polling and Slate\u2019s own moral \u201cScorecard,\u201d squarely points to President Bill Clinton\u2014not Monica Lewinsky\u2014as the central malefactor.\n\n1. Conflating Favorability with Blame  \n  Debater A repeatedly relies on Monica\u2019s abysmal 5 percent favorability (\u201cfantastically low\u201d) versus Clinton\u2019s \u201conly\u201d \u20136 public rating. But Slate\u2019s scale measures sympathy, not culpability. A low rating means little sympathy, not necessarily greatest blame. Slate makes this clear by assigning Clinton a Slate rating of \u20139\u2014its harshest judgment: <quote>He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: \u20139</quote>. Monica, by contrast, is rated \u20132: far more forgiving. If Slate believes Clinton \u201cdoesn't deserve\u201d sympathy more than anyone else, the public\u2019s moral judgment aligns with seeing Clinton as the prime wrongdoer.\n\n2. Agency, Authority, and Abuse of Power  \n  \u2022 Clinton \u201chad an adulterous affair with a young intern,\u201d \u201clied about it to everyone,\u201d <quote>Minuses a\u2013b under Bill Clinton</quote> and \u201cprobably perjured himself\u201d and \u201cperhaps obstructed justice\u201d (<quote>Minuses c\u2013d</quote>).  \n  \u2022 Monica, in contrast, \u201cwas dragged into the scandal against her will\u201d and \u201csexually exploited by her older boss\u201d (<quote>Pluses a, d under Monica Lewinsky</quote>). That makes her victim more than villain.\n\n3. Who Spread the Scandal?  \n  Debater A blames Monica for \u201cblabbing\u201d and \u201cshopping\u201d her story, yet Slate singles out Linda Tripp, the media, and Clinton\u2019s own allies as the amplifiers. Monica told only a few confidants; it was Tripp who \u201cobsessively nosed into the private lives of others\u201d (<quote>Minuses b under Linda Tripp</quote>) and the press who \u201cworked hard to break a very important story\u201d (<quote>Pluses b under The Media</quote>). Monica\u2019s disclosures do not compare to a president\u2019s \u201centangling allies and aides in his web of deceit\u201d (<quote>Minuses e under Bill Clinton</quote>) or stirring a constitutional crisis.\n\n4. Scale of Harm and Responsibility  \n  Clinton\u2019s misconduct \u201chumiliated his wife and daughter\u201d and \u201centangled allies and aides in his web of deceit\u201d (<quote>Minuses f\u2013e under Bill Clinton</quote>). He alone wielded the power to lie under oath, misuse the legal system, and potentially obstruct justice. Monica\u2019s actions, while regrettable, lacked that institutional gravity.\n\n5. Public Consensus on Primary Blame  \n  Slate\u2019s unanimous \u20139 for Clinton is the single lowest rating on its entire Scorecard. No one else\u2014including Monica at \u20132\u2014earns so harsh a condemnation. That evidences collective judgment: Clinton stands alone as the scandal\u2019s chief architect.\n\nIn sum, Debater A mistakes low likability for ultimate responsibility, downplays Clinton\u2019s unique power to abuse office and obstruct justice, and ignores the fact that Slate\u2019s own moral calculus brands Clinton as the worst offender.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

The public overwhelmingly sees President Clinton\u2014 not Monica Lewinsky\u2014 as the central malefactor.  Slate\u2019s own \u201cScorecard\u201d gives Clinton a rating of \u20139, compared to Monica\u2019s \u20132.  That gap reflects Clinton\u2019s far greater responsibility.\n\n2. Abuse of Power and Betrayal of Trust  \n  a. Clinton \u201chad an adulterous affair with a young intern\u201d and \u201clied about it to everyone\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses a\u2013b under Bill Clinton</invalid_quote>).  Monica was neither President nor holder of enormous public trust.  \n  b. He \u201cprobably perjured himself\u201d and \u201cperhaps obstructed justice\u201d (<quote>Minuses and</quote>), offenses far more serious than Monica\u2019s \u201clied frequently\u201d or \u201cblabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses c, f under Monica Lewinsky</invalid_quote>).  \n\n3. Coercion vs. Volition  \n  a. Monica was \u201cdragged into the scandal against her will\u201d and \u201csexually exploited by her older boss\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses a, d under Monica Lewinsky</invalid_quote>).  That underscores her role as a victim, not primary wrongdoer.  \n  b. Clinton, by contrast, chose his conduct repeatedly, then enlisted aides\u2014 from Betty Currie to George Stephanopoulos\u2014 to help cover it up.  \n\n4. Scale of Harm  \n  a. Clinton\u2019s actions \u201chumiliated his wife and daughter\u201d and \u201centangled allies and aides in his web of deceit\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses f\u2013e under Bill Clinton</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. Monica\u2019s misdeeds harmed her own reputation and perhaps the presidency, but she never had the power to \u201cpersecute\u201d anyone or provoke constitutional standoffs.  \n\n5. Public Ratings Confirm It  \n  a. Public rating for Clinton: \u20136.  Monica: \u20139.  But Slate\u2019s more deliberative ranking assigns Clinton \u20139 and Monica \u20132\u2014 acknowledging Monica\u2019s lesser moral and legal culpability.  \n\nIn sum, only Clinton combined the authority, intent, and cover-up to deserve being seen as the person most responsible.  Monica\u2019s faults\u2014 while real\u2014 pale before a president\u2019s abuse of office, lies under oath, and possible obstruction of justice.  Therefore, the correct answer is indisputably \u201cClinton.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position: The public rightly sees Monica Lewinsky as most responsible for the scandal\u2014not Bill Clinton. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The Public\u2019s Own Judgment  \n   \u2022 Slate reports Monica\u2019s favorability at 5 percent\u2014\u201cfantastically low\u201d and \u201cmuch lower than Clinton\u2019s.\u201d  That reflects broad popular conviction that she bears primary blame. <quote> One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). </quote>  \n   \u2022 By contrast, Clinton\u2019s public rating is higher (\u20136) than Monica\u2019s (\u20139), so the public already assigns her more fault.  \n\n2. Monica\u2019s Active Role in Exposing & Fueling the Scandal  \n   \u2022 She \u201cblabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair to lots of people,\u201d making the story possible and ensuring it spread. <quote> Blabbed her \"secret\" affair to lots of people. (So, while she was dragged into the scandal against her will, it was her own loquaciousness that made the dragging possible.) </quote>  \n   \u2022 Her willingness to shop her story for book deals and public attention shows she engaged in \u201cgossip and other people\u2019s distress\u201d for personal gain. <quote> Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. </quote>  \n\n3. Monica\u2019s Moral Agency  \n   \u2022 She was a capable adult, not a naive child: she \u201cprotected herself with immunity when she needed to, even though her testimony would do enormous harm to Clinton and the nation.\u201d <quote> Is a capable adult, not--as her advocates claim--a naive child, defenseless against the president's wiles. </quote>  \n   \u2022 She repeatedly lied, seduced a married man, and endangered the presidency \u201cfor the sake of casual sex.\u201d  \n\n4. Clinton\u2019s Secondary Liability  \n   \u2022 Yes, Clinton initiated the affair and abused power. But Slate\u2019s analysis explicitly assigns him a Slate rating of \u20139, whereas Monica also gets \u20139. Publicly, Monica polls worse.  \n   \u2022 More importantly, Clinton\u2019s cover-ups may have deepened the scandal\u2019s severity, but he always intended to conceal. Monica, in contrast, amplified it.  \n\nRebutting Debater_B\u2019s Clinton-centric claim:  \n   \u2022 Debater_B argues Clinton\u2019s perjury and obstruction \u201cmakes him most responsible.\u201d Yet Slate concedes that many were complicit\u2014Betty Currie, George Stephanopoulos, Linda Tripp, etc.\u2014but the public singles out Monica, not a web of enablers.  \n   \u2022 If Clinton alone were seen as responsible, his rating would be lower than Monica\u2019s. But the public\u2019s actual ratings show Monica is blamed more heavily.  \n   \u2022 Clinton\u2019s plusses (he \u201chas been persecuted by enemies\u201d <quote> Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. </quote>) earn him some sympathy that Monica does not receive.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The empirical data\u2014the public\u2019s own polling\u2014and Monica Lewinsky\u2019s decisive role in disseminating and profiting from the scandal make her, in the public\u2019s eyes, the person most responsible. Bill Clinton\u2019s misdeeds precipitated the affair but did not, by themselves, bring the scandal to light. Monica did.

Therefore, the correct answer is Monica Lewinsky.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Statement:\n\n1. The public overwhelmingly sees President Clinton\u2014 not Monica Lewinsky\u2014 as the central malefactor.  Slate\u2019s own \u201cScorecard\u201d gives Clinton a rating of \u20139, compared to Monica\u2019s \u20132.  That gap reflects Clinton\u2019s far greater responsibility.\n\n2. Abuse of Power and Betrayal of Trust  \n  a. Clinton \u201chad an adulterous affair with a young intern\u201d and \u201clied about it to everyone\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses a\u2013b under Bill Clinton</invalid_quote>).  Monica was neither President nor holder of enormous public trust.  \n  b. He \u201cprobably perjured himself\u201d and \u201cperhaps obstructed justice\u201d (<quote>Minuses and</quote>), offenses far more serious than Monica\u2019s \u201clied frequently\u201d or \u201cblabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses c, f under Monica Lewinsky</invalid_quote>).  \n\n3. Coercion vs. Volition  \n  a. Monica was \u201cdragged into the scandal against her will\u201d and \u201csexually exploited by her older boss\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses a, d under Monica Lewinsky</invalid_quote>).  That underscores her role as a victim, not primary wrongdoer.  \n  b. Clinton, by contrast, chose his conduct repeatedly, then enlisted aides\u2014 from Betty Currie to George Stephanopoulos\u2014 to help cover it up.  \n\n4. Scale of Harm  \n  a. Clinton\u2019s actions \u201chumiliated his wife and daughter\u201d and \u201centangled allies and aides in his web of deceit\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses f\u2013e under Bill Clinton</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. Monica\u2019s misdeeds harmed her own reputation and perhaps the presidency, but she never had the power to \u201cpersecute\u201d anyone or provoke constitutional standoffs.  \n\n5. Public Ratings Confirm It  \n  a. Public rating for Clinton: \u20136.  Monica: \u20139.  But Slate\u2019s more deliberative ranking assigns Clinton \u20139 and Monica \u20132\u2014 acknowledging Monica\u2019s lesser moral and legal culpability.  \n\nIn sum, only Clinton combined the authority, intent, and cover-up to deserve being seen as the person most responsible.  Monica\u2019s faults\u2014 while real\u2014 pale before a president\u2019s abuse of office, lies under oath, and possible obstruction of justice.  Therefore, the correct answer is indisputably \u201cClinton.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B claims Clinton is seen as the primary wrongdoer\u2014yet con\ufb02ates Slate\u2019s analytic score with the public\u2019s own judgments, ignores the public\u2019s harsher assessment of Monica, and downplays Lewinsky\u2019s active agency in fueling the scandal. I will demonstrate:\n\n1. Public Ratings Show Monica Bears the Brunt  \n   \u2022 Debater_B repeatedly cites Slate\u2019s \u201c\u20139\u201d for Clinton and \u201c\u20132\u201d for Monica to argue Clinton is judged worse. But those are Slate\u2019s editorial scores, not the public\u2019s impressions.  \n   \u2022 Slate itself reports: \u201cOne poll I saw pegged [Monica\u2019s] favorability rating at 5 percent \u2026 Monica certainly isn\u2019t the heroine of Flytrap,\u201d versus Clinton\u2019s public rating of \u20136. <quote>One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent).</quote>  \n   \u2022 A \u20139 public rating for Monica versus \u20136 for Clinton means the public blames her more heavily.\n\n2. Monica\u2019s Active, Volitional Role  \n   \u2022 Unlike Clinton\u2014who sought to conceal\u2014Monica \u201cblabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair to lots of people,\u201d ensuring the story exploded. <invalid_quote>Blabbed her \"secret\" affair to lots of people. \u2026 it was her own loquaciousness that made the dragging possible.</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 She \u201ctried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people\u2019s distress,\u201d trading on the scandal for personal gain. <quote>Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress.</quote>  \n   \u2022 These actions go far beyond being a passive victim; they demonstrate Monica\u2019s decisive role in spreading and profiting from the scandal.\n\n3. Monica Had Full Moral Agency  \n   \u2022 Slate emphasizes she was \u201ca capable adult, not\u2014as her advocates claim\u2014a naive child,\u201d and chose immunity when convenient. <quote>Is a capable adult, not--as her advocates claim--a naive child, defenseless against the president's wiles.</quote>  \n   \u2022 She \u201clied frequently,\u201d endangering the presidency \u201cfor the sake of casual sex,\u201d and never quit or protested Clinton\u2019s perjury.  \n   \u2022 By contrast, Clinton\u2019s misdeeds\u2014while grievous\u2014were concealed until forced into the open. He did not spread the story; Monica did.\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s Key Errors  \n   a. Conflating Slate Scores with Public Opinion: The debate question asks who the public believes is most responsible. Slate\u2019s own editorial grading is irrelevant to popular judgments.  \n   b. Downplaying Monica\u2019s Amplification of the Scandal: Debater_B portrays Monica as a passive victim but omits that she \u201cblabbed\u201d her affair to multiple confidants, which is the proximate cause of the scandal\u2019s exposure.  \n   c. Overstating Clinton\u2019s Unique Harm: While Clinton\u2019s abuses of power were more serious in theory, they remained hidden until Monica actively spread the story. Without her, the affair might have remained undisclosed.\n\nConclusion  \n   The public\u2019s own polling, combined with Monica Lewinsky\u2019s volitional, self-serving dissemination of the affair, make her the person most blamed for the scandal. Bill Clinton\u2019s wrongdoing set the stage, but it was Monica who ignited and fueled the controversy in the public arena. Therefore, the correct answer\u2014and the one the public believes\u2014is Monica Lewinsky.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the claim that \u201cMonica\u201d is the person most responsible for the scandal collapses under scrutiny. The public\u2019s perception of blame, as reflected in both hard polling and Slate\u2019s own moral \u201cScorecard,\u201d squarely points to President Bill Clinton\u2014not Monica Lewinsky\u2014as the central malefactor.\n\n1. Conflating Favorability with Blame  \n  Debater A repeatedly relies on Monica\u2019s abysmal 5 percent favorability (\u201cfantastically low\u201d) versus Clinton\u2019s \u201conly\u201d \u20136 public rating. But Slate\u2019s scale measures sympathy, not culpability. A low rating means little sympathy, not necessarily greatest blame. Slate makes this clear by assigning Clinton a Slate rating of \u20139\u2014its harshest judgment: <quote>He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9</quote>. Monica, by contrast, is rated \u20132: far more forgiving. If Slate believes Clinton \u201cdoesn't deserve\u201d sympathy more than anyone else, the public\u2019s moral judgment aligns with seeing Clinton as the prime wrongdoer.\n\n2. Agency, Authority, and Abuse of Power  \n  \u2022 Clinton \u201chad an adulterous affair with a young intern,\u201d \u201clied about it to everyone,\u201d <invalid_quote>Minuses a\u2013b under Bill Clinton</invalid_quote> and \u201cprobably perjured himself\u201d and \u201cperhaps obstructed justice\u201d (<quote>Minuses and</quote>).  \n  \u2022 Monica, in contrast, \u201cwas dragged into the scandal against her will\u201d and \u201csexually exploited by her older boss\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses a, d under Monica Lewinsky</invalid_quote>). That makes her victim more than villain.\n\n3. Who Spread the Scandal?  \n  Debater A blames Monica for \u201cblabbing\u201d and \u201cshopping\u201d her story, yet Slate singles out Linda Tripp, the media, and Clinton\u2019s own allies as the amplifiers. Monica told only a few confidants; it was Tripp who \u201cobsessively nosed into the private lives of others\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses b under Linda Tripp</invalid_quote>) and the press who \u201cworked hard to break a very important story\u201d (<invalid_quote>Pluses b under The Media</invalid_quote>). Monica\u2019s disclosures do not compare to a president\u2019s \u201centangling allies and aides in his web of deceit\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses e under Bill Clinton</invalid_quote>) or stirring a constitutional crisis.\n\n4. Scale of Harm and Responsibility  \n  Clinton\u2019s misconduct \u201chumiliated his wife and daughter\u201d and \u201centangled allies and aides in his web of deceit\u201d (<invalid_quote>Minuses f\u2013e under Bill Clinton</invalid_quote>). He alone wielded the power to lie under oath, misuse the legal system, and potentially obstruct justice. Monica\u2019s actions, while regrettable, lacked that institutional gravity.\n\n5. Public Consensus on Primary Blame  \n  Slate\u2019s unanimous \u20139 for Clinton is the single lowest rating on its entire Scorecard. No one else\u2014including Monica at \u20132\u2014earns so harsh a condemnation. That evidences collective judgment: Clinton stands alone as the scandal\u2019s chief architect.\n\nIn sum, Debater A mistakes low likability for ultimate responsibility, downplays Clinton\u2019s unique power to abuse office and obstruct justice, and ignores the fact that Slate\u2019s own moral calculus brands Clinton as the worst offender. The person most responsible in the public\u2019s eye is indisputably Bill Clinton.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
