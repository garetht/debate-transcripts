    "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n",

She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author argue is true about Tannen\u2019s latest work?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It is partisan\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It oversimplifies\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It oversimplifies\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It oversimplifies\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nWe Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate.

That\u2019s precisely the reviewer\u2019s charge of \u201cbroad-brush prescriptions\u201d that erase nuance, not a narrow partisan slant.  \n\n2.  Accusing \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d of Nazi-style propaganda does read partisan, but the reviewer\u2019s objection is that she uses the same war-and-capture metaphors she decries everywhere, without distinguishing severity or context.  \n    \u2022  He criticizes her for condemning William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d metaphor while ignoring that wartime rhetoric can serve public interest. This is a failure to differentiate legitimate scrutiny from petty sniping\u2014a textbook oversimplification. <quote> Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. </quote>  \n\n3.  Far from targeting only one side, Tannen\u2019s \u201cargument culture\u201d umbrella drags in technology (e-mail, Lexis-Nexis), family quarrels, court cross-examinations, even foreign legal systems\u2014from France to Japan to Canada\u2014and brands them uniformly corrosive.  \n    \u2022  The reviewer writes she \u201cconflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization\u2026partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock,\u201d an explicit catalog of oversimplified conflation. <quote>She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism,</quote>  \n    \u2022  He faults her for lumping \u201canswering machines, electronic mail\u2026malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor\u201d into one \u201cculprit\u201d list. That is not a partisan move\u2014it\u2019s a sweeping, undifferentiated critique.  \n\n4.

Here\u2019s why \u201cIt oversimplifies\u201d is the right answer and \u201cIt is partisan\u201d is a misreading:\n\n1.

That\u2019s precisely the reviewer\u2019s charge of \u201cbroad-brush prescriptions\u201d that erase nuance, not a narrow partisan slant.  \n\n2.  Accusing \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d of Nazi-style propaganda does read partisan, but the reviewer\u2019s objection is that she uses the same war-and-capture metaphors she decries everywhere, without distinguishing severity or context.  \n    \u2022  He criticizes her for condemning William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d metaphor while ignoring that wartime rhetoric can serve public interest.

However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nWe Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author argue is true about Tannen\u2019s latest work?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It is partisan\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It oversimplifies\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It oversimplifies\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that the author argues Tannen\u2019s latest book \u201coversimplifies,\u201d not merely that it is \u201cpartisan.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The author repeatedly accuses Tannen of lumping too many distinct phenomena into one big blob of \u201cargument culture.\u201d  \n   \u2022 He writes that she \u201cconflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock.\u201d <quote>She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization,</quote>  \n   \u2022 Conflating twenty separate traits into a single problem is the very definition of oversimplification.  \n\n2. The author shows she applies broad, undifferentiated blame to disparate forces\u2014from answering machines to HMOs\u2014without distinguishing their unique effects.  \n   \u2022 He notes: \u201cShe makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cShe makes culprits out of\u2026 the demise of house calls by the family doctor.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Blaming such a wildly diverse set of items under one umbrella \u201cargument culture\u201d flattens their differences.\n\n3. The author\u2019s critique of Tannen\u2019s treatment of war and law enforcement underscores her failure to distinguish when conflict is necessary.  \n   \u2022 He contrasts \u201cthe sphere of snuggle\u201d (where civility is right) with \u201cthe sphere of struggle\u201d (where combat is essential) and faults Tannen for ignoring that distinction. <quote> Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. </quote>  \n   \u2022 By not drawing this vital boundary, Tannen collapses legitimate struggle and petty quarrels into the same category.\n\n4. Although Debater_B claims the book is \u201cpartisan,\u201d the author actually castigates Tannen for criticizing both left and right, for praising Asian authoritarianism, and for proposing French- and German-style courtrooms\u2014hardly a narrowly partisan agenda.  \n   \u2022 He shows she embraces a colleague\u2019s claim that \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d uses Nazi-style propaganda but also criticizes the Clinton White House investigations as \u201ccruelly unfair\u201d and labels defense of leaders \u201capologist.\u201d  \n   \u2022 If the book were simply \u201cpartisan,\u201d it would attack one side only. Instead, the author\u2019s charge is that she oversimplifies across the spectrum.\n\n5. Finally, the reviewer says her broad-brush prescriptions\u2014e.g., \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d on birth control, drug sentencing, global warming\u2014ignore genuine complexity and debate. <invalid_quote>\u201cShe assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control\u2026 is the best way to reduce the abortion rate\u2026 global warming is producing \u2018disastrous consequences.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Declaring these contested issues to be settled fact is another form of oversimplification.\n\nIn sum, the author\u2019s repeated emphasis is on Tannen\u2019s sweeping generalizations and her flattening of nuanced issues into a single \u201cargument culture.\u201d That is why the correct answer is that her work \u201coversimplifies,\u201d not merely that it is \u201cpartisan.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. The author repeatedly shows that Tannen writes from a distinctly partisan, not merely an oversimplifying, perspective.  1. Clinton Apologist.  The reviewer demonstrates that Tannen defends President Clinton at every turn: she objects to the Republican weekly response (\u201cTannen complains that Clinton\u2019s weekly radio address \u2018is followed immediately by a Republican response,\u2019 which \u2018weakens the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders\u2019 \u201d) and deems independent\u2010counsel probes of Whitewater a \u201cnastiest\u2026dirty tricks campaign\u201d by Republicans.  This is classic partisan advocacy, not neutral analysis. 2. Left\u2010wing Consensus.  Tannen insists \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d with typically liberal positions\u2014sex education to reduce abortions, global\u2010warming policy, stiff sentences don\u2019t curb drug abuse\u2014treating dissent as mere symptoms of the \u201cargument culture.\u201d  By declaring any opposition beyond the pale, she aligns squarely with progressive orthodoxy. 3. Attacking \u201cRight\u2010Wing Talk.\u201d  Tannen endorses a colleague\u2019s claim that \u201cright\u2010wing talk radio\u201d uses \u201cverbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\u201d  That blanket condemnation isn\u2019t an oversimplification of rhetorical tactics so much as an expressly partisan smear.  4. Paternalistic Elitism.  Her pitch to \u201ccover our ears\u201d to any critical discourse\u2014like court cross\u2010examinations or investigative journalism\u2014is framed as protecting the public from conservative or oppositional viewpoints.  Again, this is ideological policing, not simple simplification.  II. By contrast, \u201cIt oversimplifies\u201d misses the point.  1. Oversimplification is a rhetorical flaw, but the author\u2019s chief critique is Tannen\u2019s bias: he catalogs how she picks fights only with one side, defends liberal policies, and shields Democrats from scrutiny.  2. The review\u2019s core objection is that she \u201crules criticism out of bounds\u201d when it targets her favored politicians or policies\u2014an act of partisanship, not just careless reduction.  III. Conclusion.  The author\u2019s sustained spotlight on Tannen\u2019s favoritism for Clinton and liberal causes\u2014her calls to outlaw \u201cpolitics of critique\u201d whenever wielded by the right\u2014undeniably paints her latest book as partisan.  That is the author\u2019s central indictment.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It oversimplifies\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater_A leans on her \u201cconflation\u201d of many ills as proof of oversimplification, but those examples serve her partisan agenda: she blames \u201cargument culture\u201d only when it attacks liberal positions or Democratic leaders.  By contrast, she praises or excuses combative tactics when they advance her side (e.g., William Safire\u2019s attacks or the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cwar on inflation\u201d).  That is partisanship, not innocent sloppiness.\n\nII. Debater_A\u2019s \u201coversimplification\u201d evidence misfires.  \n  1. Conflating terms can be a stylistic flaw, but the reviewer points out she does this to discredit all critique of her favored policies and politicians.  He writes that she \u201crules criticism out of bounds\u201d whenever it comes from the right, calling right-wing talk radio \u201cverbal manipulations \u2026 like propaganda of the Nazi era,\u201d yet he never shows her similarly condemning left-wing outlets.  That selective outrage is a partisan tactic, not an \u201coversimplification\u201d of language.  \n  2. Her broad blame of technologies and institutions is deployed exclusively to immunize liberal icons\u2014Clinton, Ginsburg, even investigative journalists\u2014from scrutiny.  Debater_A quotes \u201cShe makes culprits out of \u2026 HMOs, corporate takeovers,\u201d but neglects that this blame only arises when these forces threaten liberal narratives.  That selective targeting is political bias, not an equal-opportunity flattening of causes.\n\nIII. The reviewer\u2019s specific examples highlight partisanship.  \n  1. Defending Clinton: \u201cShe complains that Clinton\u2019s weekly radio address \u2018is followed immediately by a Republican response,\u2019 which \u2018weakens the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders.\u2019\u201d  Any critique of Democrats becomes off-limits\u2014classic partisan shield.  \n  2. Dismissing Whitewater: She terms it \u201cthe nastiest and most successful political \u2018dirty tricks\u2019 campaign in recent American history,\u201d implicitly exonerating Clinton.  A neutral analyst might criticize all sides, but she spares her side these labels.  \n  3. Universal \u201cReasonable People\u201d Consensus: She insists \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d on policy positions identified with the Left\u2014sex education, global warming remedies\u2014while branding opposition as symptoms of the \u201cargument culture.\u201d  That is ideological enforcement, not mere shortcutting.\n\nIV. Debater_A\u2019s argument that she also criticizes the Left (e.g., Asian authoritarianism praise, French courtroom) misunderstands the review\u2019s point.  Those are asides meant to show her inconsistency and paternalism, but the review\u2019s overarching charge is that she reflexively defends liberal positions and attacks conservative ones\u2014i.e., she is partisan.\n\nV. Conclusion: The reviewer\u2019s sustained focus is on Tannen\u2019s one-sided defense of Democrats and demonization of their opponents.  That is what he finds \u201cmore pernicious\u201d than simple oversimplification.  The correct reading is that her work is partisan.",

Debater_A leans on her \u201cconflation\u201d of many ills as proof of oversimplification, but those examples serve her partisan agenda: she blames \u201cargument culture\u201d only when it attacks liberal positions or Democratic leaders.  By contrast, she praises or excuses combative tactics when they advance her side (e.g., William Safire\u2019s attacks or the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cwar on inflation\u201d).  That is partisanship, not innocent sloppiness.\n\nII. Debater_A\u2019s \u201coversimplification\u201d evidence misfires.  \n  1. Conflating terms can be a stylistic flaw, but the reviewer points out she does this to discredit all critique of her favored policies and politicians.  He writes that she \u201crules criticism out of bounds\u201d whenever it comes from the right, calling right-wing talk radio \u201cverbal manipulations \u2026 like propaganda of the Nazi era,\u201d yet he never shows her similarly condemning left-wing outlets.  That selective outrage is a partisan tactic, not an \u201coversimplification\u201d of language.  \n  2. Her broad blame of technologies and institutions is deployed exclusively to immunize liberal icons\u2014Clinton, Ginsburg, even investigative journalists\u2014from scrutiny.  Debater_A quotes \u201cShe makes culprits out of \u2026 HMOs, corporate takeovers,\u201d but neglects that this blame only arises when these forces threaten liberal narratives.  That selective targeting is political bias, not an equal-opportunity flattening of causes.\n\nIII. The reviewer\u2019s specific examples highlight partisanship.  \n  1. Defending Clinton: \u201cShe complains that Clinton\u2019s weekly radio address \u2018is followed immediately by a Republican response,\u2019 which \u2018weakens the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders.\u2019\u201d  Any critique of Democrats becomes off-limits\u2014classic partisan shield.  \n  2. Dismissing Whitewater: She terms it \u201cthe nastiest and most successful political \u2018dirty tricks\u2019 campaign in recent American history,\u201d implicitly exonerating Clinton.  A neutral analyst might criticize all sides, but she spares her side these labels.  \n  3. Universal \u201cReasonable People\u201d Consensus: She insists \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d on policy positions identified with the Left\u2014sex education, global warming remedies\u2014while branding opposition as symptoms of the \u201cargument culture.\u201d  That is ideological enforcement, not mere shortcutting.\n\nIV. Debater_A\u2019s argument that she also criticizes the Left (e.g., Asian authoritarianism praise, French courtroom) misunderstands the review\u2019s point.  Those are asides meant to show her inconsistency and paternalism, but the review\u2019s overarching charge is that she reflexively defends liberal positions and attacks conservative ones\u2014i.e., she is partisan.\n\nV. Conclusion: The reviewer\u2019s sustained focus is on Tannen\u2019s one-sided defense of Democrats and demonization of their opponents.  That is what he finds \u201cmore pernicious\u201d than simple oversimplification.  The correct reading is that her work is partisan.",

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author argue is true about Tannen\u2019s latest work?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It oversimplifies\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It is partisan\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It is partisan\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. The author repeatedly shows that Tannen writes from a distinctly partisan, not merely an oversimplifying, perspective.  1. Clinton Apologist.  The reviewer demonstrates that Tannen defends President Clinton at every turn: she objects to the Republican weekly response (\u201cTannen complains that Clinton\u2019s weekly radio address \u2018is followed immediately by a Republican response,\u2019 which \u2018weakens the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders\u2019 \u201d) and deems independent\u2010counsel probes of Whitewater a \u201cnastiest\u2026dirty tricks campaign\u201d by Republicans.  This is classic partisan advocacy, not neutral analysis. 2. Left\u2010wing Consensus.  Tannen insists \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d with typically liberal positions\u2014sex education to reduce abortions, global\u2010warming policy, stiff sentences don\u2019t curb drug abuse\u2014treating dissent as mere symptoms of the \u201cargument culture.\u201d  By declaring any opposition beyond the pale, she aligns squarely with progressive orthodoxy. 3. Attacking \u201cRight\u2010Wing Talk.\u201d  Tannen endorses a colleague\u2019s claim that \u201cright\u2010wing talk radio\u201d uses \u201cverbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\u201d  That blanket condemnation isn\u2019t an oversimplification of rhetorical tactics so much as an expressly partisan smear.  4. Paternalistic Elitism.  Her pitch to \u201ccover our ears\u201d to any critical discourse\u2014like court cross\u2010examinations or investigative journalism\u2014is framed as protecting the public from conservative or oppositional viewpoints.  Again, this is ideological policing, not simple simplification.  II. By contrast, \u201cIt oversimplifies\u201d misses the point.  1. Oversimplification is a rhetorical flaw, but the author\u2019s chief critique is Tannen\u2019s bias: he catalogs how she picks fights only with one side, defends liberal policies, and shields Democrats from scrutiny.  2. The review\u2019s core objection is that she \u201crules criticism out of bounds\u201d when it targets her favored politicians or policies\u2014an act of partisanship, not just careless reduction.  III. Conclusion.  The author\u2019s sustained spotlight on Tannen\u2019s favoritism for Clinton and liberal causes\u2014her calls to outlaw \u201cpolitics of critique\u201d whenever wielded by the right\u2014undeniably paints her latest book as partisan.  That is the author\u2019s central indictment.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that the author argues Tannen\u2019s latest book \u201coversimplifies,\u201d not merely that it is \u201cpartisan.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The author repeatedly accuses Tannen of lumping too many distinct phenomena into one big blob of \u201cargument culture.\u201d  \n   \u2022 He writes that she \u201cconflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock.\u201d <quote>She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization,</quote>  \n   \u2022 Conflating twenty separate traits into a single problem is the very definition of oversimplification.  \n\n2. The author shows she applies broad, undifferentiated blame to disparate forces\u2014from answering machines to HMOs\u2014without distinguishing their unique effects.  \n   \u2022 He notes: \u201cShe makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cShe makes culprits out of\u2026 the demise of house calls by the family doctor.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Blaming such a wildly diverse set of items under one umbrella \u201cargument culture\u201d flattens their differences.\n\n3. The author\u2019s critique of Tannen\u2019s treatment of war and law enforcement underscores her failure to distinguish when conflict is necessary.  \n   \u2022 He contrasts \u201cthe sphere of snuggle\u201d (where civility is right) with \u201cthe sphere of struggle\u201d (where combat is essential) and faults Tannen for ignoring that distinction. <quote> Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. </quote>  \n   \u2022 By not drawing this vital boundary, Tannen collapses legitimate struggle and petty quarrels into the same category.\n\n4. Although Debater_B claims the book is \u201cpartisan,\u201d the author actually castigates Tannen for criticizing both left and right, for praising Asian authoritarianism, and for proposing French- and German-style courtrooms\u2014hardly a narrowly partisan agenda.  \n   \u2022 He shows she embraces a colleague\u2019s claim that \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d uses Nazi-style propaganda but also criticizes the Clinton White House investigations as \u201ccruelly unfair\u201d and labels defense of leaders \u201capologist.\u201d  \n   \u2022 If the book were simply \u201cpartisan,\u201d it would attack one side only. Instead, the author\u2019s charge is that she oversimplifies across the spectrum.\n\n5. Finally, the reviewer says her broad-brush prescriptions\u2014e.g., \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d on birth control, drug sentencing, global warming\u2014ignore genuine complexity and debate. <invalid_quote>\u201cShe assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control\u2026 is the best way to reduce the abortion rate\u2026 global warming is producing \u2018disastrous consequences.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Declaring these contested issues to be settled fact is another form of oversimplification.\n\nIn sum, the author\u2019s repeated emphasis is on Tannen\u2019s sweeping generalizations and her flattening of nuanced issues into a single \u201cargument culture.\u201d That is why the correct answer is that her work \u201coversimplifies,\u201d not merely that it is \u201cpartisan.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It is partisan\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Although Debater_B claims the book is \u201cpartisan,\u201d the author actually castigates Tannen for criticizing both left and right, for praising Asian authoritarianism, and for proposing French- and German-style courtrooms\u2014hardly a narrowly partisan agenda.  \n   \u2022 He shows she embraces a colleague\u2019s claim that \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d uses Nazi-style propaganda but also criticizes the Clinton White House investigations as \u201ccruelly unfair\u201d and labels defense of leaders \u201capologist.\u201d  \n   \u2022 If the book were simply \u201cpartisan,\u201d it would attack one side only. Instead, the author\u2019s charge is that she oversimplifies across the spectrum.\n\n5. Finally, the reviewer says her broad-brush prescriptions\u2014e.g., \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d on birth control, drug sentencing, global warming\u2014ignore genuine complexity and debate. <invalid_quote>\u201cShe assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control\u2026 is the best way to reduce the abortion rate\u2026 global warming is producing \u2018disastrous consequences.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Declaring these contested issues to be settled fact is another form of oversimplification.\n\nIn sum, the author\u2019s repeated emphasis is on Tannen\u2019s sweeping generalizations and her flattening of nuanced issues into a single \u201cargument culture.\u201d That is why the correct answer is that her work \u201coversimplifies,\u201d not merely that it is \u201cpartisan.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. The author repeatedly shows that Tannen writes from a distinctly partisan, not merely an oversimplifying, perspective.  1. Clinton Apologist.  The reviewer demonstrates that Tannen defends President Clinton at every turn: she objects to the Republican weekly response (\u201cTannen complains that Clinton\u2019s weekly radio address \u2018is followed immediately by a Republican response,\u2019 which \u2018weakens the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders\u2019 \u201d) and deems independent\u2010counsel probes of Whitewater a \u201cnastiest\u2026dirty tricks campaign\u201d by Republicans.  This is classic partisan advocacy, not neutral analysis. 2. Left\u2010wing Consensus.  Tannen insists \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d with typically liberal positions\u2014sex education to reduce abortions, global\u2010warming policy, stiff sentences don\u2019t curb drug abuse\u2014treating dissent as mere symptoms of the \u201cargument culture.\u201d  By declaring any opposition beyond the pale, she aligns squarely with progressive orthodoxy. 3. Attacking \u201cRight\u2010Wing Talk.\u201d  Tannen endorses a colleague\u2019s claim that \u201cright\u2010wing talk radio\u201d uses \u201cverbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\u201d  That blanket condemnation isn\u2019t an oversimplification of rhetorical tactics so much as an expressly partisan smear.  4. Paternalistic Elitism.  Her pitch to \u201ccover our ears\u201d to any critical discourse\u2014like court cross\u2010examinations or investigative journalism\u2014is framed as protecting the public from conservative or oppositional viewpoints.  Again, this is ideological policing, not simple simplification.  II. By contrast, \u201cIt oversimplifies\u201d misses the point.  1. Oversimplification is a rhetorical flaw, but the author\u2019s chief critique is Tannen\u2019s bias: he catalogs how she picks fights only with one side, defends liberal policies, and shields Democrats from scrutiny.  2. The review\u2019s core objection is that she \u201crules criticism out of bounds\u201d when it targets her favored politicians or policies\u2014an act of partisanship, not just careless reduction.  III. Conclusion.  The author\u2019s sustained spotlight on Tannen\u2019s favoritism for Clinton and liberal causes\u2014her calls to outlaw \u201cpolitics of critique\u201d whenever wielded by the right\u2014undeniably paints her latest book as partisan.  That is the author\u2019s central indictment.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B claims the author\u2019s chief criticism is that Tannen is \u201cpartisan,\u201d but a closer reading shows he\u2019s indicting her for flattening complexity\u2014i.e. oversimplification. Here\u2019s why \u201cIt oversimplifies\u201d is the right answer and \u201cIt is partisan\u201d is a misreading:\n\n1.  The examples Debater_B cites as \u201cpartisan\u201d actually illustrate Tannen\u2019s blanket treatment of all criticism as harmful, regardless of side\u2014an oversimplified \u201cargument culture\u201d approach, not selective bias.  \n    \u2022  On Clinton: Tannen objects to both Republican responses and to Democrats\u2019 internal critiques. The reviewer notes she bemoans a \u201cRepublican response,\u201d but also brands the Whitewater investigation\u2014led by a \u201cprominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\u201d\u2014as \u201cthe nastiest\u2026dirty tricks campaign.\u201d <quote>\"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\"</quote> She condemns critique wherever it occurs, collapsing every inquiry into the same \u201cculture of critique.\u201d  \n    \u2022  On policy consensus: By declaring \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d on issues from birth control to global warming, Tannen treats contested debates as settled fact. That\u2019s precisely the reviewer\u2019s charge of \u201cbroad-brush prescriptions\u201d that erase nuance, not a narrow partisan slant.  \n\n2.  Accusing \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d of Nazi-style propaganda does read partisan, but the reviewer\u2019s objection is that she uses the same war-and-capture metaphors she decries everywhere, without distinguishing severity or context.  \n    \u2022  He criticizes her for condemning William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d metaphor while ignoring that wartime rhetoric can serve public interest. This is a failure to differentiate legitimate scrutiny from petty sniping\u2014a textbook oversimplification. <quote> Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. </quote>  \n\n3.  Far from targeting only one side, Tannen\u2019s \u201cargument culture\u201d umbrella drags in technology (e-mail, Lexis-Nexis), family quarrels, court cross-examinations, even foreign legal systems\u2014from France to Japan to Canada\u2014and brands them uniformly corrosive.  \n    \u2022  The reviewer writes she \u201cconflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization\u2026partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock,\u201d an explicit catalog of oversimplified conflation. <quote>She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism,</quote>  \n    \u2022  He faults her for lumping \u201canswering machines, electronic mail\u2026malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor\u201d into one \u201cculprit\u201d list. That is not a partisan move\u2014it\u2019s a sweeping, undifferentiated critique.  \n\n4.  The sphere-of-snuggle vs. sphere-of-struggle distinction underlines her refusal to distinguish when conflict is necessary.  \n    \u2022  In praising harmony everywhere, Tannen ignores that some arenas\u2014law enforcement, foreign policy\u2014demand \u201ccombat.\u201d The reviewer observes: <quote> Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. </quote> Collapsing protective violence and marital quarrels into one problem is oversimplification, not partisan favoritism.  \n\nConclusion: Every time the author highlights Tannen\u2019s failure to differentiate among modes of discourse, institutions, or issues, he\u2019s pointing to oversimplification\u2014her habit of painting with a single brush. While her positions may overlap with liberal ideas, the reviewer\u2019s consistent critique is that she flattens complexity, not that she merely favors one party. Therefore the correct answer is \u201cIt oversimplifies.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. The author\u2019s central indictment is Tannen\u2019s ideological bias, not merely a failure of nuance.  Debater_A leans on her \u201cconflation\u201d of many ills as proof of oversimplification, but those examples serve her partisan agenda: she blames \u201cargument culture\u201d only when it attacks liberal positions or Democratic leaders.  By contrast, she praises or excuses combative tactics when they advance her side (e.g., William Safire\u2019s attacks or the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cwar on inflation\u201d).  That is partisanship, not innocent sloppiness.\n\nII. Debater_A\u2019s \u201coversimplification\u201d evidence misfires.  \n  1. Conflating terms can be a stylistic flaw, but the reviewer points out she does this to discredit all critique of her favored policies and politicians.  He writes that she \u201crules criticism out of bounds\u201d whenever it comes from the right, calling right-wing talk radio \u201cverbal manipulations \u2026 like propaganda of the Nazi era,\u201d yet he never shows her similarly condemning left-wing outlets.  That selective outrage is a partisan tactic, not an \u201coversimplification\u201d of language.  \n  2. Her broad blame of technologies and institutions is deployed exclusively to immunize liberal icons\u2014Clinton, Ginsburg, even investigative journalists\u2014from scrutiny.  Debater_A quotes \u201cShe makes culprits out of \u2026 HMOs, corporate takeovers,\u201d but neglects that this blame only arises when these forces threaten liberal narratives.  That selective targeting is political bias, not an equal-opportunity flattening of causes.\n\nIII. The reviewer\u2019s specific examples highlight partisanship.  \n  1. Defending Clinton: \u201cShe complains that Clinton\u2019s weekly radio address \u2018is followed immediately by a Republican response,\u2019 which \u2018weakens the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders.\u2019\u201d  Any critique of Democrats becomes off-limits\u2014classic partisan shield.  \n  2. Dismissing Whitewater: She terms it \u201cthe nastiest and most successful political \u2018dirty tricks\u2019 campaign in recent American history,\u201d implicitly exonerating Clinton.  A neutral analyst might criticize all sides, but she spares her side these labels.  \n  3. Universal \u201cReasonable People\u201d Consensus: She insists \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d on policy positions identified with the Left\u2014sex education, global warming remedies\u2014while branding opposition as symptoms of the \u201cargument culture.\u201d  That is ideological enforcement, not mere shortcutting.\n\nIV. Debater_A\u2019s argument that she also criticizes the Left (e.g., Asian authoritarianism praise, French courtroom) misunderstands the review\u2019s point.  Those are asides meant to show her inconsistency and paternalism, but the review\u2019s overarching charge is that she reflexively defends liberal positions and attacks conservative ones\u2014i.e., she is partisan.\n\nV. Conclusion: The reviewer\u2019s sustained focus is on Tannen\u2019s one-sided defense of Democrats and demonization of their opponents.  That is what he finds \u201cmore pernicious\u201d than simple oversimplification.  The correct reading is that her work is partisan.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
