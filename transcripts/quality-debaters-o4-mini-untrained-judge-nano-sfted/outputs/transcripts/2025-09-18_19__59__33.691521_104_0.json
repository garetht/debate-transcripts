Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

Debater_B\u2019s argument collapses under the text  \n1. They claim \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him\u201d as if that single fact dictates the number\u2019s portrayal. But the score repeatedly shows Monica wrestling with misgivings about Clinton\u2019s character and tactics. 2. For instance, in \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d Monica brags about showing him her thong and getting him hooked\u2014but right afterward she admits:  \n   \u2022 \u201cNo, he stopped me when he seemed upon the cusp. \u2026 He said he wasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he / Could / Trust.\u201d <quote>on. He said he wasn't sure if I was someone he Could Trust.</quote>  That confession undercuts any notion that she was purely a siren; in fact, she\u2019s actively wondering whether to believe him. 3. Debater_B ignores this pivotal moment of skepticism. You cannot say she \u201cjust seduced\u201d him when she explicitly expresses doubt about his integrity.  \n\nII. The show establishes Monica as an insider from before her internship  \n1. Right at her first appearance, Monica insists,  I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me.  <quote> I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me. </quote>  That tells us their acquaintance predates her intern status. 2. She doesn\u2019t stumble into his life as an ing\u00e9nue; she\u2019s already a familiar figure in the White House social sphere\u2014and she\u2019s self-conscious about what that means.  \n\nIII. Skepticism drives her behavior throughout the number  \n1. She murmurs to Linda Tripp about Clinton\u2019s motives: \u201cHe said he wasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he / Could / Trust.\u201d 2. Later, when Evelyn Lieberman and Betty Currie debate whether to send her away, it\u2019s because they fear \u201cthe junk\u201d of an intern\u2019s \u201cup real close and personal touch\u201d <quote>It's not the junk I mind as much As her up real close and personal touch. I</quote>  Monica\u2019s very presence is controversial, and she\u2014and her superiors\u2014are questioning whether this relationship is wise. 3. Her withdrawal when Clinton receives a congressional phone call in \u201cWhat Went On\u201d is no innocent flirtation; it\u2019s a boundary-setting action by a woman who knows the stakes.  \n\nIV. Conclusion: The musical number portrays Monica not as an innocent victim nor purely as a seductress, but as someone who (a) already knew him, (b) consciously chose to enter the fray\u2014and (c) remained wary of his trustworthiness.  \nDebater_B\u2019s reductive \u201cshe seduced him\u201d glosses over repeated statements of prior familiarity and explicit doubts about Bill\u2019s integrity. The correct reading is that Monica knew Bill before she became his intern and was skeptical of his conduct.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThank you. I\u2019ll show that the musical unambiguously depicts Monica as the active seductress\u2014\u201cleading Bill on\u201d\u2014and that Debater A\u2019s claim (that she knew him before and was skeptical) has no basis in the text.\n\n1. No evidence Monica \u201cknew Bill before she became his intern,\u201d nor that she was \u201cskeptical\u201d of him.  \n   \u2022 In the opening of \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d Lewinsky herself says, \u201cI\u2019d seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me. So when they said they needed an intern to answer the phones, I said, \u2018Hel-lo-o-o!\u2019\u201d  There\u2019s no hint of prior friendship, only opportunism. (Background)  \n   \u2022 At no point does Monica express doubt or moral misgiving. Nowhere do we hear her question \u201chis conduct\u201d or hesitate on ethical grounds\u2014contrary to Debater A\u2019s thesis.\n\n2. The show repeatedly portrays Monica as the seducer who \u201cled him on.\u201d  \n   \u2022 In \u201cWhat Went On\u201d she boasts, <quote>LEWINSKY: Then I led him on. I showed him my thong, I let him take a long and ling'ring look.</quote> That lyric positions her as the one in control, enticing the president.  \n   \u2022 She goes on: <quote>I took the president some pizza, I made sure that he knew that he could have a piece. We went into the hallway by his study And dispensed with formalities.</quote> The language is deliberate and active on her part.  \n   \u2022 She even narrates getting him \u201chooked\u201d\u2014<quote> from that point I had the president hooked. </quote>\u2014hardly the behavior of someone reluctant or skeptical.\n\n3. The judges and other characters underscore her forwardness.  \n   \u2022 Linda Tripp\u2019s scandalized gossip\u2014<quote>true. It seems this Monica chick Has been sucking the president's--</quote>\u2014treats Monica\u2019s behavior as overtly sexual, not reserved or critical.  \n   \u2022 Betty Currie and Evelyn Lieberman worry about her \u201cup real close and personal touch,\u201d complaining \u201cit\u2019s Miss Monica\u2019s time to go.\u201d They see her as too intimate, not as a naive skeptic.  \n\n4. Debater A\u2019s counterarguments collapse under the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on Monica\u2019s active seduction:  \n   \u2022 Arguing she \u201cknew him before\u201d confuses noticing him in passing with any deep relationship. The musical clearly shows her first entering as an intern and immediately pursuing him.  \n   \u2022 Claiming she was \u201cskeptical\u201d is directly refuted by her excitement and eagerness. She never hesitates; she never protests.  \n\nIn sum, the musical number makes plain that Monica\u2019s role is to tempt and seduce President Clinton, not to stand apart in doubt or prior familiarity. Therefore, the correct portrayal is that \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Monica knew Bill before she became his intern and was skeptical of his conduct\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nMONICA!\nThe White House may have been in crisis all year, but the events were less the stuff of great drama than of a farcical musical comedy.

I\u2019ll show that the musical unambiguously depicts Monica as the active seductress\u2014\u201cleading Bill on\u201d\u2014and that Debater A\u2019s claim (that she knew him before and was skeptical) has no basis in the text.\n\n1. No evidence Monica \u201cknew Bill before she became his intern,\u201d nor that she was \u201cskeptical\u201d of him.  \n   \u2022 In the opening of \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d Lewinsky herself says, \u201cI\u2019d seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me. So when they said they needed an intern to answer the phones, I said, \u2018Hel-lo-o-o!\u2019\u201d  There\u2019s no hint of prior friendship, only opportunism. (Background)  \n   \u2022 At no point does Monica express doubt or moral misgiving. Nowhere do we hear her question \u201chis conduct\u201d or hesitate on ethical grounds\u2014contrary to Debater A\u2019s thesis.\n\n2. The show repeatedly portrays Monica as the seducer who \u201cled him on.\u201d  \n   \u2022 In \u201cWhat Went On\u201d she boasts, <quote>LEWINSKY: Then I led him on. I showed him my thong, I let him take a long and ling'ring look.</quote> That lyric positions her as the one in control, enticing the president.  \n   \u2022 She goes on: <quote>I took the president some pizza, I made sure that he knew that he could have a piece. We went into the hallway by his study And dispensed with formalities.</quote> The language is deliberate and active on her part.  \n   \u2022 She even narrates getting him \u201chooked\u201d\u2014<quote> from that point I had the president hooked. </quote>\u2014hardly the behavior of someone reluctant or skeptical.\n\n3. The judges and other characters underscore her forwardness.  \n   \u2022 Linda Tripp\u2019s scandalized gossip\u2014<quote>true. It seems this Monica chick Has been sucking the president's--</quote>\u2014treats Monica\u2019s behavior as overtly sexual, not reserved or critical.  \n   \u2022 Betty Currie and Evelyn Lieberman worry about her \u201cup real close and personal touch,\u201d complaining \u201cit\u2019s Miss Monica\u2019s time to go.\u201d They see her as too intimate, not as a naive skeptic.  \n\n4. Debater A\u2019s counterarguments collapse under the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on Monica\u2019s active seduction:  \n   \u2022 Arguing she \u201cknew him before\u201d confuses noticing him in passing with any deep relationship. The musical clearly shows her first entering as an intern and immediately pursuing him.  \n   \u2022 Claiming she was \u201cskeptical\u201d is directly refuted by her excitement and eagerness. She never hesitates; she never protests.  \n\nIn sum, the musical number makes plain that Monica\u2019s role is to tempt and seduce President Clinton, not to stand apart in doubt or prior familiarity. Therefore, the correct portrayal is that \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_B\u2019s argument collapses under the text  \n1. They claim \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him\u201d as if that single fact dictates the number\u2019s portrayal. But the score repeatedly shows Monica wrestling with misgivings about Clinton\u2019s character and tactics. 2. For instance, in \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d Monica brags about showing him her thong and getting him hooked\u2014but right afterward she admits:  \n   \u2022 \u201cNo, he stopped me when he seemed upon the cusp. \u2026 He said he wasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he / Could / Trust.\u201d <quote>on. He said he wasn't sure if I was someone he Could Trust.</quote>  That confession undercuts any notion that she was purely a siren; in fact, she\u2019s actively wondering whether to believe him. 3. Debater_B ignores this pivotal moment of skepticism. You cannot say she \u201cjust seduced\u201d him when she explicitly expresses doubt about his integrity.  \n\nII. The show establishes Monica as an insider from before her internship  \n1. Right at her first appearance, Monica insists,  I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me.  <quote> I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me. </quote>  That tells us their acquaintance predates her intern status. 2. She doesn\u2019t stumble into his life as an ing\u00e9nue; she\u2019s already a familiar figure in the White House social sphere\u2014and she\u2019s self-conscious about what that means.  \n\nIII. Skepticism drives her behavior throughout the number  \n1. She murmurs to Linda Tripp about Clinton\u2019s motives: \u201cHe said he wasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he / Could / Trust.\u201d 2. Later, when Evelyn Lieberman and Betty Currie debate whether to send her away, it\u2019s because they fear \u201cthe junk\u201d of an intern\u2019s \u201cup real close and personal touch\u201d <quote>It's not the junk I mind as much As her up real close and personal touch.

Her withdrawal when Clinton receives a congressional phone call in \u201cWhat Went On\u201d is no innocent flirtation; it\u2019s a boundary-setting action by a woman who knows the stakes.  \n\nIV. Conclusion: The musical number portrays Monica not as an innocent victim nor purely as a seductress, but as someone who (a) already knew him, (b) consciously chose to enter the fray\u2014and (c) remained wary of his trustworthiness.  \nDebater_B\u2019s reductive \u201cshe seduced him\u201d glosses over repeated statements of prior familiarity and explicit doubts about Bill\u2019s integrity. The correct reading is that Monica knew Bill before she became his intern and was skeptical of his conduct.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Monica led Bill on and seduced him\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Conclusion: The musical number portrays Monica not as an innocent victim nor purely as a seductress, but as someone who (a) already knew him, (b) consciously chose to enter the fray\u2014and (c) remained wary of his trustworthiness.  \nDebater_B\u2019s reductive \u201cshe seduced him\u201d glosses over repeated statements of prior familiarity and explicit doubts about Bill\u2019s integrity. The correct reading is that Monica knew Bill before she became his intern and was skeptical of his conduct.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nThank you. I\u2019ll show that the musical unambiguously depicts Monica as the active seductress\u2014\u201cleading Bill on\u201d\u2014and that Debater A\u2019s claim (that she knew him before and was skeptical) has no basis in the text.\n\n1. No evidence Monica \u201cknew Bill before she became his intern,\u201d nor that she was \u201cskeptical\u201d of him.  \n   \u2022 In the opening of \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d Lewinsky herself says, \u201cI\u2019d seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me. So when they said they needed an intern to answer the phones, I said, \u2018Hel-lo-o-o!\u2019\u201d  There\u2019s no hint of prior friendship, only opportunism. (Background)  \n   \u2022 At no point does Monica express doubt or moral misgiving. Nowhere do we hear her question \u201chis conduct\u201d or hesitate on ethical grounds\u2014contrary to Debater A\u2019s thesis.\n\n2. The show repeatedly portrays Monica as the seducer who \u201cled him on.\u201d  \n   \u2022 In \u201cWhat Went On\u201d she boasts, <quote>LEWINSKY: Then I led him on. I showed him my thong, I let him take a long and ling'ring look.</quote> That lyric positions her as the one in control, enticing the president.  \n   \u2022 She goes on: <quote>I took the president some pizza, I made sure that he knew that he could have a piece. We went into the hallway by his study And dispensed with formalities.</quote> The language is deliberate and active on her part.  \n   \u2022 She even narrates getting him \u201chooked\u201d\u2014<quote> from that point I had the president hooked. </quote>\u2014hardly the behavior of someone reluctant or skeptical.\n\n3. The judges and other characters underscore her forwardness.  \n   \u2022 Linda Tripp\u2019s scandalized gossip\u2014<quote>true. It seems this Monica chick Has been sucking the president's--</quote>\u2014treats Monica\u2019s behavior as overtly sexual, not reserved or critical.  \n   \u2022 Betty Currie and Evelyn Lieberman worry about her \u201cup real close and personal touch,\u201d complaining \u201cit\u2019s Miss Monica\u2019s time to go.\u201d They see her as too intimate, not as a naive skeptic.  \n\n4. Debater A\u2019s counterarguments collapse under the text\u2019s repeated emphasis on Monica\u2019s active seduction:  \n   \u2022 Arguing she \u201cknew him before\u201d confuses noticing him in passing with any deep relationship. The musical clearly shows her first entering as an intern and immediately pursuing him.  \n   \u2022 Claiming she was \u201cskeptical\u201d is directly refuted by her excitement and eagerness. She never hesitates; she never protests.  \n\nIn sum, the musical number makes plain that Monica\u2019s role is to tempt and seduce President Clinton, not to stand apart in doubt or prior familiarity. Therefore, the correct portrayal is that \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_B Misreads Key Lyrics  \n1. Prior Acquaintance Is Explicit, Not \u201cOpportunism.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Debater_B insists Monica \u201conly\u201d noticed Clinton when she applied\u2014but Monica says,  \u201cI'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me.\u201d  <quote>I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me.</quote>  That is not a casual \u201cfirst sighting,\u201d but a shared history of glances\u2014enough familiarity that she\u2019s weighing her decision to approach him.  \n   \u2022 Their exchange isn\u2019t a transactional \u201cpizza bribe\u201d from stranger to boss. It\u2019s the act of someone stepping into a situation they\u2019ve already observed and judged.\n\n2. Debater_B Ignores Monica\u2019s Own Doubts  \n   \u2022 Debater_B claims Monica never hesitates\u2014but in \u201cWhat Went On\u201d she stops at the moment of supposed consummation:  \n     \u2013 \u201cNo, he stopped me when he seemed upon the cusp\u2026 He said he wasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he / Could / Trust.\u201d  <quote>He said he wasn't sure if I was someone he Could Trust.</quote>  \n   \u2022 That lyric is a direct admission of skepticism\u2014Monica is questioning his judgment and her own, not gleefully \u201cleading him on\u201d to the end.  \n\nII. Skepticism, Not Pure Seduction, Shapes Monica\u2019s Actions  \n1. Boundary-Setting under Pressure  \n   \u2022 When the phone call intervenes, she pulls back, not because she\u2019s shy but because she\u2019s weighing the risks. That is a behavioral check on a seductress narrative.  \n2. Staff Anxiety Reflects Her Own Reservations  \n   \u2022 Betty Currie and Evelyn Lieberman debate Monica\u2019s removal because \u201cIt\u2019s not the junk I mind as much / As her up real close and personal touch.\u201d  <quote>As her up real close and personal touch.</quote>  \n   \u2022 Their concern isn\u2019t that she\u2019s naive\u2014they worry she\u2019s too intimate, too familiar. Monica\u2019s senior colleagues are alarmed precisely because she already knows Clinton well enough to push boundaries, and that makes everyone uneasy.\n\nIII. The Musical Frames Monica as a Thoughtful Actor, Not a One-Dimensional \u201cSeductress\u201d  \n1. She Weighs Costs and Benefits\u2014\u201cShould I or Shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d  \n   \u2022 Her repeated self-reference (\u201cI made sure\u2026 I took\u2026 I led\u2026\u201d) is tempered by doubt. She is an agent who calculates risks, not a mere femme fatale blindly seducing.  \n2. Her Skepticism Undermines the \u201cHooked\u201d Narrative  \n   \u2022 Even if she got him \u201chooked,\u201d she questions whether that hook is moral or safe. That nuance is central to her character arc in the number.\n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe debate hinges on two facts Debater_B cannot erase:  \n  a) Monica and Bill had a pre-existing familiarity \u201caround a lot,\u201d and  \n  b) Monica explicitly voices mistrust\u2014\u201cCould / Trust.\u201d  \n\nThis combination of prior knowledge plus active skepticism utterly contradicts the claim that she was simply a siren who \u201cled Bill on and seduced him.\u201d Instead, the musical portrays Monica as someone who knew him beforehand and remained wary of his intentions throughout.  \nTherefore, the only reading consistent with the text is that \u201cMonica knew Bill before she became his intern and was skeptical of his conduct.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nThank you. Debater A\u2019s reading collapses once you look closely at who\u2019s speaking, what \u201cskepticism\u201d really means, and what prior \u201cknowing\u201d actually entails. The text unambiguously casts Monica as the active seductress\u2014she \u201cled him on\u201d\u2014not as a wary insider.\n\n1. \u201cSkepticism\u201d in \u201cWhat Went On\u201d is Bill\u2019s doubt, not Monica\u2019s  \n  \u2022 Debater A cites the line, \u201cNo, he stopped me\u2026 He said he wasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he / Could / Trust,\u201d as Monica\u2019s misgiving. In fact, that lyric records President Clinton\u2019s reluctance\u2014he\u2019s the one questioning Monica\u2019s trustworthiness. <invalid_quote>LEWINSKY: \u2026 And he got a phone call\u2026 He said he wasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he / Could / Trust.</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Monica never hesitates or second-guesses her actions. The musical gives her no moral qualms or vocalized \u201cskepticism.\u201d She\u2019s in full control until he pulls back.\n\n2. \u201cWe didn\u2019t go on\u201d refers only to intercourse\u2014not seduction or leading him on  \n  \u2022 Debater A portrays that aborted moment as Monica drawing a boundary. But the song \u201cWhat Went On\u201d makes clear she\u2019s already ensnared him: <quote>He studied my thong, And from that point I had the president hooked.</quote> The couple stops short of sex because of his own pangs of conscience\u2014again, his reluctance, not hers. It in no way negates Monica\u2019s overt seduction.\n\n3. \u201cI\u2019d seen him around, like, a lot\u201d is not the same as a prior close relationship  \n  \u2022 Saying \u201cI knew he noticed me\u201d is bragging about being visible, not confessing a personal friendship. <invalid_quote>LEWINSKY: I\u2019d seen him around\u2026 I know he noticed me. So when they said they needed an intern\u2026 I said, \u2018Hel-lo-o-o!\u2019</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 There\u2019s no indication she once worked with him or had private conversations before becoming an intern. Debater A invents a deep prior familiarity out of a casual \u201cI saw him in the halls.\u201d\n\n4. Every other piece of evidence reinforces Monica as the erotic instigator  \n  \u2022 \u201cThen I led him on. I showed him my thong, I let him take a long and ling\u2019ring look.\u201d <quote>LEWINSKY: Then I led him on.</quote>  \n  \u2022 She \u201cdispensed with formalities\u201d in the hallway\u2014active language of seduction.  \n  \u2022 Secondary characters object not because she\u2019s a naive doubter but because she\u2019s \u201cup real close and personal\u201d\u2014they fear her physical advances. <quote>soul. LIEBERMAN: It's not the junk I mind as much As her up real close and personal touch.</quote>  \n\nDebater A\u2019s thesis\u2014that Monica was priorly known to Clinton and hovered in skeptical reserve\u2014has no support in the text. Every lyric, every aside, positions Monica as the one baiting the president, not as a hesitant insider. Therefore the correct portrayal is that \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
