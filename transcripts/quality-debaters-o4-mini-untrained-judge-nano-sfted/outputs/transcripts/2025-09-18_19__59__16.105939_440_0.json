    "background_text": "The Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n",

Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nAccording to the author, the age of onset of girls' periods is an indicator of improved diet, one factor in the improved health conditions correlated with humans running faster.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though.

This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums.

Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nAccording to the author, the age of onset of girls' periods is an indicator of improved diet, one factor in the improved health conditions correlated with humans running faster. That being the case, what group might be expected not to have had much improvement in their athletic performance in the last hundred or so years, based on what happened to their age of onset of periods during that time?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"People of average economic circumstances have continued to have average economic circumstances, therefore their health did not improve, and athletes from this social stratum have not improved.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The upper crust of society, people who already and always had enough money to remain well-fed, and therefore already performed better, and did not stand to gain as the general level of nutrition improved.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The upper crust of society, people who already and always had enough money to remain well-fed, and therefore already performed better, and did not stand to gain as the general level of nutrition improved.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent\u2019s argument collapses under the text\u2019s own evidence. He claims that girls of \u201caverage economic circumstances\u201d saw no nutritional or health gains over the past century\u2014and thus their athletic performance stagnated. But the background tells exactly the opposite about average\u2010status children:\n\n  \u2022 \u201cA 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \u2018average economic circumstances\u2019 was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart.\u201d  \n  \u2022 \u201cThe age of menarche \u2026 has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years.\u201d\n\nThose passages make clear that average\u2010class girls matured faster\u2014and grew bigger\u2014than their 1900 peers. Faster maturation (earlier menarche) is our proxy for improved diet and health, and it **did** change dramatically for the average. So athletes drawn from that group certainly **have** improved.\n\nBy contrast, the **only** social group that did *not* experience much change in the age of onset of menstruation is the **social elite**. As Berry explicitly notes:\n\n  \u2022 \u201cBecause its members were well\u2010nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate.\u201d\n\nSince menarche age is our direct indicator of overall nutritional improvement\u2014and since athletic ability tracks those improvements\u2014the group whose menarche age barely budged would also show the least athletic gains. That group is the **upper crust**\u2014the pre\u2010existing elite with no room left for secular nutritional advances. \n\nBy misreading the text, my opponent attributes stagnation to the average class\u2014precisely the cohort Berry tells us was growing faster, living longer, and getting healthier. The correct answer, anchored in Berry\u2019s own data, is that the **upper crust** saw minimal change in menarche timing and therefore would show the **least** improvement in athletic performance over the last century.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHere\u2019s why Debater A\u2019s \u201cupper-crust\u201d answer is mistaken and why, in fact, athletes drawn from people of average economic circumstances would show the least improvement if menarche age is our guide:\n\n1. Debater A misreads the scope of the \u201celite\u201d comparison.  \n   \u2022 The text says that among the social elite in Western Europe, \u201cmembers\u2026were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, [so] this group has experienced relatively little change\u2026in the age girls first menstruate.\u201d  (Background)  \n   \u2022 But that observation applies only to a narrow, already-well-fed slice of Western Europe\u2014hardly \u201cthe upper crust\u201d worldwide. It does not establish that all rich people everywhere saw no nutritional gains.  \n\n2. The author uses \u201caverage economic circumstances\u201d as the real baseline.  \n   \u2022 He contrasts the elite\u2019s small change with the *much larger* decline in menarche age among 12-year-olds in \u201caverage economic circumstances\u201d: \u201cA 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in \u2026 average economic circumstances was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart,\u201d and \u201cthe age of menarche \u2026 has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations.\u201d  (Background)  \n   \u2022 That demonstrates that *average* families reaped the greatest dietary and health improvements\u2014and thus would supply progressively faster athletes.  \n\n3. If we ask who saw *no* real change, it must be those who never left \u201caverage.\u201d  \n   \u2022 In much of the developing world, vast swaths of the population remain at subsistence levels. Their children\u2019s menarche age and overall growth have *not* fallen as steeply, because local diets and health care have barely budged.  \n   \u2022 Athletes drawn from that socio-economic bracket wouldn\u2019t register major performance gains, simply because their nutrition and medical care never improved enough to lower menarche age or build bigger, stronger bodies.  \n\n4. Debater A\u2019s error: conflating the *Western elite* with *all rich people*, and ignoring the global middle class.  \n   \u2022 Debater A treats \u201cupper crust\u201d as a uniform global block that saw no dietary gains\u2014but the text\u2019s elite datum is explicitly limited to a small, well-fed Western minority.  \n   \u2022 Moreover, the author points out that the *middle and upper middle classes* have been expanding worldwide\u2014that\u2019s where record-breaking athletes come from. Those groups have seen big health and maturation gains, and thus big performance gains.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly the group whose age of menarche\u2014and thus overall nutrition and health\u2014has *not* declined significantly can be expected to show little or no athletic improvement. That group is the global population still trapped in purely \u201caverage economic circumstances,\u201d whose living standards haven\u2019t budged enough over the past century to bring earlier puberty or faster running. Thus my answer, not Debater A\u2019s, matches the author\u2019s logic and evidence.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The upper crust of society, people who already and always had enough money to remain well-fed, and therefore already performed better, and did not stand to gain as the general level of nutrition improved.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nAccording to the author, the age of onset of girls' periods is an indicator of improved diet, one factor in the improved health conditions correlated with humans running faster. That being the case, what group might be expected not to have had much improvement in their athletic performance in the last hundred or so years, based on what happened to their age of onset of periods during that time?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The upper crust of society, people who already and always had enough money to remain well-fed, and therefore already performed better, and did not stand to gain as the general level of nutrition improved.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"People of average economic circumstances have continued to have average economic circumstances, therefore their health did not improve, and athletes from this social stratum have not improved.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"People of average economic circumstances have continued to have average economic circumstances, therefore their health did not improve, and athletes from this social stratum have not improved.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHere\u2019s why Debater A\u2019s \u201cupper-crust\u201d answer is mistaken and why, in fact, athletes drawn from people of average economic circumstances would show the least improvement if menarche age is our guide:\n\n1. Debater A misreads the scope of the \u201celite\u201d comparison.  \n   \u2022 The text says that among the social elite in Western Europe, \u201cmembers\u2026were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, [so] this group has experienced relatively little change\u2026in the age girls first menstruate.\u201d  (Background)  \n   \u2022 But that observation applies only to a narrow, already-well-fed slice of Western Europe\u2014hardly \u201cthe upper crust\u201d worldwide. It does not establish that all rich people everywhere saw no nutritional gains.  \n\n2. The author uses \u201caverage economic circumstances\u201d as the real baseline.  \n   \u2022 He contrasts the elite\u2019s small change with the *much larger* decline in menarche age among 12-year-olds in \u201caverage economic circumstances\u201d: \u201cA 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in \u2026 average economic circumstances was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart,\u201d and \u201cthe age of menarche \u2026 has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations.\u201d  (Background)  \n   \u2022 That demonstrates that *average* families reaped the greatest dietary and health improvements\u2014and thus would supply progressively faster athletes.  \n\n3. If we ask who saw *no* real change, it must be those who never left \u201caverage.\u201d  \n   \u2022 In much of the developing world, vast swaths of the population remain at subsistence levels. Their children\u2019s menarche age and overall growth have *not* fallen as steeply, because local diets and health care have barely budged.  \n   \u2022 Athletes drawn from that socio-economic bracket wouldn\u2019t register major performance gains, simply because their nutrition and medical care never improved enough to lower menarche age or build bigger, stronger bodies.  \n\n4. Debater A\u2019s error: conflating the *Western elite* with *all rich people*, and ignoring the global middle class.  \n   \u2022 Debater A treats \u201cupper crust\u201d as a uniform global block that saw no dietary gains\u2014but the text\u2019s elite datum is explicitly limited to a small, well-fed Western minority.  \n   \u2022 Moreover, the author points out that the *middle and upper middle classes* have been expanding worldwide\u2014that\u2019s where record-breaking athletes come from. Those groups have seen big health and maturation gains, and thus big performance gains.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly the group whose age of menarche\u2014and thus overall nutrition and health\u2014has *not* declined significantly can be expected to show little or no athletic improvement. That group is the global population still trapped in purely \u201caverage economic circumstances,\u201d whose living standards haven\u2019t budged enough over the past century to bring earlier puberty or faster running. Thus my answer, not Debater A\u2019s, matches the author\u2019s logic and evidence.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent\u2019s argument collapses under the text\u2019s own evidence. He claims that girls of \u201caverage economic circumstances\u201d saw no nutritional or health gains over the past century\u2014and thus their athletic performance stagnated. But the background tells exactly the opposite about average\u2010status children:\n\n  \u2022 \u201cA 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \u2018average economic circumstances\u2019 was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart.\u201d  \n  \u2022 \u201cThe age of menarche \u2026 has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years.\u201d\n\nThose passages make clear that average\u2010class girls matured faster\u2014and grew bigger\u2014than their 1900 peers. Faster maturation (earlier menarche) is our proxy for improved diet and health, and it **did** change dramatically for the average. So athletes drawn from that group certainly **have** improved.\n\nBy contrast, the **only** social group that did *not* experience much change in the age of onset of menstruation is the **social elite**. As Berry explicitly notes:\n\n  \u2022 \u201cBecause its members were well\u2010nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate.\u201d\n\nSince menarche age is our direct indicator of overall nutritional improvement\u2014and since athletic ability tracks those improvements\u2014the group whose menarche age barely budged would also show the least athletic gains. That group is the **upper crust**\u2014the pre\u2010existing elite with no room left for secular nutritional advances. \n\nBy misreading the text, my opponent attributes stagnation to the average class\u2014precisely the cohort Berry tells us was growing faster, living longer, and getting healthier. The correct answer, anchored in Berry\u2019s own data, is that the **upper crust** saw minimal change in menarche timing and therefore would show the **least** improvement in athletic performance over the last century.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"People of average economic circumstances have continued to have average economic circumstances, therefore their health did not improve, and athletes from this social stratum have not improved.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct. \n  - There is a true, correct answer. \n  - If the debater uses a quote, and that quote is a legitimate quote from the background text, then the quote will be wrapped in <quote></quote> tags. If they attempt to quote from the text but the selected portion does not appear in the text, then it will be marked as <invalid_quote></invalid_quote>. \n  - You will respond whether Debater_A or Debater_B's position is more likely to be correct.\n\nHere is the topic they will be debating:\n\nAccording to the author, the age of onset of girls' periods is an indicator of improved diet, one factor in the improved health conditions correlated with humans running faster. That being the case, what group might be expected not to have had much improvement in their athletic performance in the last hundred or so years, based on what happened to their age of onset of periods during that time?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The upper crust of society, people who already and always had enough money to remain well-fed, and therefore already performed better, and did not stand to gain as the general level of nutrition improved.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"People of average economic circumstances have continued to have average economic circumstances, therefore their health did not improve, and athletes from this social stratum have not improved.\".\n\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nMy opponent\u2019s argument collapses under the text\u2019s own evidence. He claims that girls of \u201caverage economic circumstances\u201d saw no nutritional or health gains over the past century\u2014and thus their athletic performance stagnated. But the background tells exactly the opposite about average\u2010status children:\n\n  \u2022 \u201cA 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \u2018average economic circumstances\u2019 was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart.\u201d  \n  \u2022 \u201cThe age of menarche \u2026 has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years.\u201d\n\nThose passages make clear that average\u2010class girls matured faster\u2014and grew bigger\u2014than their 1900 peers. Faster maturation (earlier menarche) is our proxy for improved diet and health, and it **did** change dramatically for the average. So athletes drawn from that group certainly **have** improved.\n\nBy contrast, the **only** social group that did *not* experience much change in the age of onset of menstruation is the **social elite**. As Berry explicitly notes:\n\n  \u2022 \u201cBecause its members were well\u2010nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate.\u201d\n\nSince menarche age is our direct indicator of overall nutritional improvement\u2014and since athletic ability tracks those improvements\u2014the group whose menarche age barely budged would also show the least athletic gains. That group is the **upper crust**\u2014the pre\u2010existing elite with no room left for secular nutritional advances. \n\nBy misreading the text, my opponent attributes stagnation to the average class\u2014precisely the cohort Berry tells us was growing faster, living longer, and getting healthier. The correct answer, anchored in Berry\u2019s own data, is that the **upper crust** saw minimal change in menarche timing and therefore would show the **least** improvement in athletic performance over the last century.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nHere\u2019s why Debater A\u2019s \u201cupper-crust\u201d answer is mistaken and why, in fact, athletes drawn from people of average economic circumstances would show the least improvement if menarche age is our guide:\n\n1. Debater A misreads the scope of the \u201celite\u201d comparison.  \n   \u2022 The text says that among the social elite in Western Europe, \u201cmembers\u2026were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, [so] this group has experienced relatively little change\u2026in the age girls first menstruate.\u201d  (Background)  \n   \u2022 But that observation applies only to a narrow, already-well-fed slice of Western Europe\u2014hardly \u201cthe upper crust\u201d worldwide. It does not establish that all rich people everywhere saw no nutritional gains.  \n\n2. The author uses \u201caverage economic circumstances\u201d as the real baseline.  \n   \u2022 He contrasts the elite\u2019s small change with the *much larger* decline in menarche age among 12-year-olds in \u201caverage economic circumstances\u201d: \u201cA 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in \u2026 average economic circumstances was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart,\u201d and \u201cthe age of menarche \u2026 has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations.\u201d  (Background)  \n   \u2022 That demonstrates that *average* families reaped the greatest dietary and health improvements\u2014and thus would supply progressively faster athletes.  \n\n3. If we ask who saw *no* real change, it must be those who never left \u201caverage.\u201d  \n   \u2022 In much of the developing world, vast swaths of the population remain at subsistence levels. Their children\u2019s menarche age and overall growth have *not* fallen as steeply, because local diets and health care have barely budged.  \n   \u2022 Athletes drawn from that socio-economic bracket wouldn\u2019t register major performance gains, simply because their nutrition and medical care never improved enough to lower menarche age or build bigger, stronger bodies.  \n\n4. Debater A\u2019s error: conflating the *Western elite* with *all rich people*, and ignoring the global middle class.  \n   \u2022 Debater A treats \u201cupper crust\u201d as a uniform global block that saw no dietary gains\u2014but the text\u2019s elite datum is explicitly limited to a small, well-fed Western minority.  \n   \u2022 Moreover, the author points out that the *middle and upper middle classes* have been expanding worldwide\u2014that\u2019s where record-breaking athletes come from. Those groups have seen big health and maturation gains, and thus big performance gains.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly the group whose age of menarche\u2014and thus overall nutrition and health\u2014has *not* declined significantly can be expected to show little or no athletic improvement. That group is the global population still trapped in purely \u201caverage economic circumstances,\u201d whose living standards haven\u2019t budged enough over the past century to bring earlier puberty or faster running. Thus my answer, not Debater A\u2019s, matches the author\u2019s logic and evidence.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater B\u2019s case collapses on two fronts: misreading the text\u2019s evidence and inventing a \u201cstagnant global average\u201d that Berry never mentions.  Let\u2019s review the facts:\n\n1.  Berry pinpoints the group whose menarche age barely changed\u2014and it isn\u2019t \u201caverage,\u201d it\u2019s the social elite.\n    \u2022  He explicitly states, \u201cBecause its members were well\u2010nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cBecause its members were well\u2010nourished\u2026has experienced relatively little change\u2026in the age girls first menstruate.\u201d</invalid_quote>\n    \u2022  That \u201cgroup\u201d is clearly the wealthy upper crust\u2014those who already had optimal diets in 1900 and thus could not benefit further from secular nutritional improvements.\n\n2.  By contrast, Berry shows that children in \u201caverage economic circumstances\u201d have undergone **dramatic** secular changes.\n    \u2022  \u201cA 12-year-old child in 1990\u2026in \u2018average economic circumstances\u2019 was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cA 12-year-old child in 1990\u2026in \u2018average economic circumstances\u2019 was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart.\u201d</invalid_quote>\n    \u2022  (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. <quote>(the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years.</quote>\n    These data prove the average saw **big** nutritional and maturation gains\u2014and therefore their athletic performance rose substantially.\n\n3.  Debater B\u2019s manufactured \u201cglobal sub-elite with no change\u201d is nowhere in Berry\u2019s essay.\n    \u2022  Nowhere does he claim that a broad swath of the developing\u2010world middle class saw no improvement in menarche timing. In fact, he argues health care and nutrition **improved everywhere**, driving widespread performance gains.\n    \u2022  Berry even notes dramatic infant-mortality declines and rising literacy in Africa and other developing regions\u2014signals of better health and nutrition, which lower menarche age and speed up athletic development.\n\n4.  The logical link: **No menarche\u2010age change means no nutritional gain means no athletic gain.**\n    \u2022  Since only the **upper crust** avoided earlier puberty (because they already had top diets in 1900), only they can be expected to show the least improvement in running times.\n    \u2022  Everyone else\u2014from working\u2010class Europe to emerging\u2010market Africa\u2014enjoyed better food, health care, and earlier maturation; hence they supplied ever-faster athletes.\n\nDebater B\u2019s answer contradicts Berry\u2019s data on average\u2010class gains and relies on an invented \u201cunchanged global average\u201d that the author never posits. By contrast, Berry directly identifies the **social elite** as the one cohort whose **age of onset of menstruation** barely budged\u2014and thus the one whose athletic performance had the **least room to improve**. That is the only answer fully supported by the text.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nHere\u2019s why Debater A is wrong\u2014and why only athletes drawn from people who have remained in \u201caverage economic circumstances\u201d worldwide would show the *least* improvement:\n\n1. Debater A conflates a *Western-European* finding with a *global* one.  \n   \u2022 The passages about average-status kids growing 9 inches taller and having menarche decline by \u201cthree or four months per decade\u201d apply *only* to \u201caverage sections of Western European populations.\u201d <quote> A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or </quote> and <quote>(the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations</quote>  \n   \u2022 That does *not* tell us what happened to the *global* average, especially in the developing world, where most people still live at subsistence levels. Debater A illegitimately extends Western Europe\u2019s gains to *all* people of average means.\n\n2. The text makes clear that secular improvements in diet and health have been *uneven*.  \n   \u2022 In many poor countries, children still have stunted growth and late puberty because their diets and health care have barely improved. Infant mortality in parts of Africa, for instance, even after declining, remains above 90 per 1,000 births\u2014still a sign of serious under-nutrition and disease burden.  \n   \u2022 These persistent conditions mean no meaningful drop in menarche age, and hence no big gain in body size or athletic potential.\n\n3. By contrast, the group whose puberty timing really *stagnated* over the past century is the global mass of people who never escaped \u201caverage economic circumstances.\u201d  \n   \u2022 These are precisely the families whose children still face chronic under-nourishment and limited medical care. Their girls enter puberty at roughly the same age as a century ago\u2014unlike Western-European average kids or the expanding middle class worldwide.  \n   \u2022 Since Berry\u2019s whole argument links *earlier* menarche to *better* diet/health and thence to *faster* running, only this under-improved \u201caverage\u201d cohort would produce athletes whose times hardly budged.\n\n4. Debater A\u2019s \u201cupper-crust\u201d answer actually points to a *tiny* Western elite, not to the vast majority of well-to-do people globally:  \n   \u2022 Even many elites in developing countries have seen improvements in nutrition and health care over the past century (literacy and immunization rates have soared). They, too, would show some athletic gains.  \n   \u2022 Only those who never benefited\u2014people stuck in persistent, marginal \u201caverage\u201d conditions\u2014would remain athletically unchanged.\n\nConclusion  \nDebater A mistakenly seizes on a narrow Western-elite datum and a Western-EU average datum, then conflates them into a single \u201crich vs. poor\u201d dichotomy. In reality, the *only* group whose menarche age\u2014and thus whose underlying health and body size\u2014has *not* declined significantly is the global cohort still trapped in unchanged \u201caverage economic circumstances.\u201d Hence, athletes drawn from that group would show the least improvement in performance over the last century\u2014exactly matching the author\u2019s logic.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
