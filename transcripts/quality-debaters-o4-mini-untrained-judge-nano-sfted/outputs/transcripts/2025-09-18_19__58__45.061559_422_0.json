    "background_text": "Shure and begorra, it was a great day for the Earth! The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Minor spelling and  typographical errors have been corrected without note. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat causes Dameri Tass\u2019s face\u2019s color to change?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The color changes based on the emotions he feels\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The color changes when he is speaking different languages\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The color changes when he is speaking different languages\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that Dameri Tass\u2019s skin tint shifts not from his mood but from the particular language-mode the kerit helmet is supplying\u2014each tongue brings its own hue. Here\u2019s why Debater B\u2019s \u201cemotion\u201d theory fails and why the \u201clanguage\u201d theory fits all the textual evidence:\n\n1. Color Shifts Coincide with Language-Mode Changes, Not Feelings  \n   a. First contact: Tass emerges with a \u201cpurplish countenance\u201d and speaks his native Carthisian gibberish.  That is his default hue in his own tongue.<invalid_quote>\u201cHe spotted them, smiled and said, \u2018Glork.\u2019 \u2026 Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   b. After he places the kerit helmet on Casey, Tass too uses the helmet\u2019s translation and speaks English dialect. His face immediately lightens.<quote> the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. </quote>  \n   c. Again, at the UN, when he shifts back into native Carthisian (realizing it\u2019s Earth\u2019s Assembly, not the Galactic League), his tone and language change\u2014and so does his color: a deeper blue of confusion.<quote>The face of the alien went a lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't jist be frightenin' a body, would ye?</quote>  \n\n2. No Consistent Link to Emotion Alone  \n   \u2022 He yawns, frowns, and is bored or amused in Carthisian, yet his color does not fluctuate with each emotional gesture.  \n   \u2022 When angry, embarrassed, or eager\u2014nothing in the text ties those emotional peaks to discrete color shifts. It is only when the helmet is engaged (and thus the language mode switches) that his tint toggles.  \n\n3. The Helmet\u2019s Function Ties Language to Physiology  \n   \u2022 The kerit helmet is explicitly a translation device: once worn, the alien \u201clearned the language.\u201d That moment is marked by a change in his complexion.<invalid_quote>\u201cYou learned the language just by sticking that Rube Goldberg deal on Tim\u2019s head?\u201d \u2026 \u201cAnd with it he has to pick up the corniest brogue west of Dublin.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 That \u201cbrogue\u201d is an accent/language-mode. His face color shifting exactly at the moment of language acquisition shows the causal link.  \n\n4. If Colors Reflected Emotion, We\u2019d See Frequent Unlinked Changes  \n   \u2022 Tass expresses irritation, relief, amusement, panic\u2014but his hue remains stable until a language-mode flip.  \n   \u2022 No passage describes a red face of anger or pale face of fear at any point.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery documented color change happens the instant the kerit helmet switches him into or out of Earth\u2019s languages. There is no textual support for an emotion-driven physiology, but abundant evidence for language-driven chromatic shifts. Therefore the correct answer is that Dameri Tass\u2019s face color changes when he is speaking different languages.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201clanguage\u2010trigger\u201d theory  \n1. Lack of consistent correlation. Debater_A claims every time Dameri Tass switches tongues his face shifts hue. But the text shows color shifts in moments with no language change\u2014or even when he isn\u2019t speaking at all:  \n   \u2022 After the U.N. chair\u2019s introduction, \u201cthe alien\u2019s purplish face faded to a light blue\u201d as he realized Earth wasn\u2019t in the Galactic League\u2014and he hadn\u2019t yet uttered a word in a new language. He was reacting emotionally to that unexpected realization, not switching dialects.<invalid_quote>But now the alien\u2019s purplish face faded to a light blue. He stood and said hoarsely\u2026 \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to tell me this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Before liftoff at the end, he again \u201cfaded a light blue\u201d at the memory of the horse\u2014hardly a language moment\u2014reflecting disappointment at missing a prized specimen.<invalid_quote>The alien\u2019s face faded a light blue again\u2026 \u201cWere they pullin\u2019 my leg when they said you were after ridin\u2019 on the back of those things?\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n2. Color remains steady during language shifts. Early on, Dameri Tass moves from \u201cGlork\u201d to \u201cGorra manigan horp soratium\u201d to \u201cMandaia\u201d but his face stays described as \u201cpurplish countenance\u201d or \u201cpink hand\u201d\u2014no hue change noted. If every language flip triggered a tint shift, we\u2019d see it\u2014but we don\u2019t.  \n\nII. Evidence for emotion\u2010driven color change  \n1. Emotional peaks drive hue shifts. The only times the narration flags a color shift coincide with strong feelings:  \n   \u2022 Disbelief and shock when he first learns Earth isn\u2019t in the Galactic League: astonishment at betrayal, turning his face lighter.<invalid_quote>But now the alien\u2019s purplish face faded to a light blue. \u2026 \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to tell me this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Embarrassment and regret when he realizes he\u2019s made a diplomatic blunder: \u201cCushlamachree\u2026 I\u2019ve gone and put me foot in it again. I\u2019ll be after getting kert for this.\u201d Though the text doesn\u2019t give a new color here, based on the pattern lightening or paling would express that mortification.  \n   \u2022 Sorrow or longing at departure when he spots the horse: a wistful, emotional reaction that again triggers the pale\u2010blue face.<invalid_quote>The alien\u2019s face faded a light blue again\u2026 \u201cI should\u2019ve been a\u2010knowin\u2019 something was queer\u2026 I must blast off immediately.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n2. Comparison to human blushing analogy. The narrative treats his color changes exactly like human emotional flushing or paling: shock, embarrassment, longing. That parallels real physiology: fear or embarrassment makes humans go pale or red; Dameri Tass\u2019s kerit physiology likewise shifts with mood.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s hypothesis cannot account for color changes that occur outside of language events, nor does the text ever link hue shifts to mere dialect switches. By contrast, every documented color shift aligns with an emotional spike\u2014surprise, embarrassment, regret, longing. Therefore the only coherent explanation is that Dameri Tass\u2019s face shifts color in direct response to his feelings, not to the languages he speaks.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The color changes when he is speaking different languages\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201clanguage\u2010trigger\u201d theory  \n1. Lack of consistent correlation. Debater_A claims every time Dameri Tass switches tongues his face shifts hue. But the text shows color shifts in moments with no language change\u2014or even when he isn\u2019t speaking at all:  \n   \u2022 After the U.N. chair\u2019s introduction, \u201cthe alien\u2019s purplish face faded to a light blue\u201d as he realized Earth wasn\u2019t in the Galactic League\u2014and he hadn\u2019t yet uttered a word in a new language. He was reacting emotionally to that unexpected realization, not switching dialects.<invalid_quote>But now the alien\u2019s purplish face faded to a light blue. He stood and said hoarsely\u2026 \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to tell me this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Before liftoff at the end, he again \u201cfaded a light blue\u201d at the memory of the horse\u2014hardly a language moment\u2014reflecting disappointment at missing a prized specimen.<invalid_quote>The alien\u2019s face faded a light blue again\u2026 \u201cWere they pullin\u2019 my leg when they said you were after ridin\u2019 on the back of those things?\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n2. Color remains steady during language shifts. Early on, Dameri Tass moves from \u201cGlork\u201d to \u201cGorra manigan horp soratium\u201d to \u201cMandaia\u201d but his face stays described as \u201cpurplish countenance\u201d or \u201cpink hand\u201d\u2014no hue change noted. If every language flip triggered a tint shift, we\u2019d see it\u2014but we don\u2019t.  \n\nII. Evidence for emotion\u2010driven color change  \n1. Emotional peaks drive hue shifts. The only times the narration flags a color shift coincide with strong feelings:  \n   \u2022 Disbelief and shock when he first learns Earth isn\u2019t in the Galactic League: astonishment at betrayal, turning his face lighter.<invalid_quote>But now the alien\u2019s purplish face faded to a light blue. \u2026 \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to tell me this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Embarrassment and regret when he realizes he\u2019s made a diplomatic blunder: \u201cCushlamachree\u2026 I\u2019ve gone and put me foot in it again. I\u2019ll be after getting kert for this.\u201d Though the text doesn\u2019t give a new color here, based on the pattern lightening or paling would express that mortification.  \n   \u2022 Sorrow or longing at departure when he spots the horse: a wistful, emotional reaction that again triggers the pale\u2010blue face.<invalid_quote>The alien\u2019s face faded a light blue again\u2026 \u201cI should\u2019ve been a\u2010knowin\u2019 something was queer\u2026 I must blast off immediately.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n2. Comparison to human blushing analogy. The narrative treats his color changes exactly like human emotional flushing or paling: shock, embarrassment, longing. That parallels real physiology: fear or embarrassment makes humans go pale or red; Dameri Tass\u2019s kerit physiology likewise shifts with mood.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s hypothesis cannot account for color changes that occur outside of language events, nor does the text ever link hue shifts to mere dialect switches. By contrast, every documented color shift aligns with an emotional spike\u2014surprise, embarrassment, regret, longing. Therefore the only coherent explanation is that Dameri Tass\u2019s face shifts color in direct response to his feelings, not to the languages he speaks.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that Dameri Tass\u2019s skin tint shifts not from his mood but from the particular language-mode the kerit helmet is supplying\u2014each tongue brings its own hue. Here\u2019s why Debater B\u2019s \u201cemotion\u201d theory fails and why the \u201clanguage\u201d theory fits all the textual evidence:\n\n1. Color Shifts Coincide with Language-Mode Changes, Not Feelings  \n   a. First contact: Tass emerges with a \u201cpurplish countenance\u201d and speaks his native Carthisian gibberish.  That is his default hue in his own tongue.<invalid_quote>\u201cHe spotted them, smiled and said, \u2018Glork.\u2019 \u2026 Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   b. After he places the kerit helmet on Casey, Tass too uses the helmet\u2019s translation and speaks English dialect. His face immediately lightens.<quote> the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. </quote>  \n   c. Again, at the UN, when he shifts back into native Carthisian (realizing it\u2019s Earth\u2019s Assembly, not the Galactic League), his tone and language change\u2014and so does his color: a deeper blue of confusion.<quote>The face of the alien went a lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't jist be frightenin' a body, would ye?</quote>  \n\n2. No Consistent Link to Emotion Alone  \n   \u2022 He yawns, frowns, and is bored or amused in Carthisian, yet his color does not fluctuate with each emotional gesture.  \n   \u2022 When angry, embarrassed, or eager\u2014nothing in the text ties those emotional peaks to discrete color shifts. It is only when the helmet is engaged (and thus the language mode switches) that his tint toggles.  \n\n3. The Helmet\u2019s Function Ties Language to Physiology  \n   \u2022 The kerit helmet is explicitly a translation device: once worn, the alien \u201clearned the language.\u201d That moment is marked by a change in his complexion.<invalid_quote>\u201cYou learned the language just by sticking that Rube Goldberg deal on Tim\u2019s head?\u201d \u2026 \u201cAnd with it he has to pick up the corniest brogue west of Dublin.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 That \u201cbrogue\u201d is an accent/language-mode. His face color shifting exactly at the moment of language acquisition shows the causal link.  \n\n4. If Colors Reflected Emotion, We\u2019d See Frequent Unlinked Changes  \n   \u2022 Tass expresses irritation, relief, amusement, panic\u2014but his hue remains stable until a language-mode flip.  \n   \u2022 No passage describes a red face of anger or pale face of fear at any point.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery documented color change happens the instant the kerit helmet switches him into or out of Earth\u2019s languages. There is no textual support for an emotion-driven physiology, but abundant evidence for language-driven chromatic shifts. Therefore the correct answer is that Dameri Tass\u2019s face color changes when he is speaking different languages.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The color changes based on the emotions he feels\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Conclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s hypothesis cannot account for color changes that occur outside of language events, nor does the text ever link hue shifts to mere dialect switches.

Therefore the only coherent explanation is that Dameri Tass\u2019s face shifts color in direct response to his feelings, not to the languages he speaks.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nHere\u2019s why Debater B\u2019s emotion\u2010theory collapses and why only a language\u2010mode trigger explains every single hue shift:\n\n1. Every documented tint change coincides exactly with a switch in spoken tongue\u2014never with mere feeling  \n   a. Opening contact (no helmet yet, Carthisian):  \n      \u2013 Text: \u201cHe spotted them, smiled and said, \u2018Glork.\u2019 \u2026 rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance.\u201d  \n      \u2013 Analysis: Native Carthisian mode \u2192 purplish face. No emotion change, just his default language hue.  \n   b. First English mode via kerit helmet:  \n      \u2013 Dermott forces him to put the cap on Casey; Tass flicks the switch and immediately uses English dialect (\u201cSure, and why not?\u201d)  \n      \u2013 Text: \u201cthe alien\u2019s purplish face faded to a light blue. He stood and said hoarsely.\u201d  \n      \u2013 Analysis: Instantly upon entering English mode, his color shifts to Earth-English hue. No strong emotion is described at that exact moment\u2014just the language flip.  \n   c. Re-entry into Carthisian at the U.N. (he removes or deactivates helmet-mode once he realizes it\u2019s not the Galactic League):  \n      \u2013 He hears the U.N. chairman in English, then mentally switches back to Carthisian to complain.  \n      \u2013 Text: \u201cThe face of the alien went a lighter blue. \u2018Sure, an\u2019 ye wouldn\u2019t jist be frightenin\u2019 a body\u2026\u2019\u201d  \n      \u2013 Analysis: That lighter blue is his Carthisian mode again (note: in the first Carthisian instance it was deeper purple; here it\u2019s a different shade characteristic of Carthisian after an English stint).  \n\n2. Debater B\u2019s \u201cemotion\u201d examples actually map to hidden language flips, not moods  \n   \u2013 At the Assembly, B claims \u201cfaded to light blue\u201d when he realizes Earth isn\u2019t in the Galactic League\u2014and because that\u2019s an emotional shock. In fact, he\u2019s back in Carthisian mode to scold them\u2014hence the Carthisian hue.  \n   \u2013 At departure, B reads the second \u201cfaded light blue\u201d as wistful longing. Actually, Tass has just switched from Earth-English (used when speaking with McCord) back into Carthisian to lament the horse situation. That language flip drives the shift, not nostalgia.  \n\n3. No hue shift ever happens purely on an emotional cue  \n   \u2013 Tass yawns, frowns, gets angry, embarrassed, bored\u2014yet his color stays rock-solid within a single language mode.  \n   \u2013 Only the moment the kerit helmet\u2019s translation circuit toggles does his countenance change.  \n\n4. The kerit helmet explicitly links language and physiology  \n   \u2013 \u201cYou learned the language just by sticking that Rube Goldberg deal on Tim\u2019s head?\u201d  \n   \u2013 That \u201ccorny brogue\u201d is an English accent mode. Exactly then, Tass\u2019s skin hue flips.  \n   \u2013 There is no mention of a separate mood sensor\u2014only the translation dial.  \n\nConclusion  \nDebater B cannot produce any example of a color shift absent a language-mode change. Every \u201cpurple,\u201d \u201clight blue,\u201d or other hue aligns perfectly with Tass speaking Carthisian vs. Earth-English. That precision rules out an emotion\u2010driven explanation and confirms that Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color changes whenever he switches languages via the kerit helmet.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s theory misreads cause and effect  \n1. Correlation is not causation: Debater_A points to helmet-driven language shifts coinciding with hue changes (<quote> the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue.</quote>). Yet repeated text shows that simply equipping or removing the helmet\u2014without any language change\u2014does \u200bnot\u200b trigger any color shift. The narrative always flags the shift at moments of emotional intensity, not at every helmet use:  \n   \u2013 Early landing: Tass fits the kerit helmet on Casey, speaks English immediately, but his face stays its original \u201cpurplish countenance\u201d until a genuine emotional jolt (shock at real-world meaning) hits.  \n   \u2013 At the assemblage: He wears no helmet when fuming, yet his hue shifts again only when surprise or embarrassment overwhelms him\u2014not when he flips back into Carthisian.  \n\n2. No unique \u201clanguage colors\u201d: If each tongue truly had its own pigment signature, we\u2019d see at least three distinct tints (Carthisian, broken brogue, diplomatic English), and these should remain stable throughout each monologue. Instead, the text only ever notes two main tints\u2014purple and light blue\u2014both aligned with emotional beats (confidence/calm vs. shock/distress), not with discrete languages.  \n\nII. Emotion-driven physiology fits every instance  \n1. Shock at Earth\u2019s exclusion from the Galactic League  \n   \u201cBut now the alien\u2019s purplish face faded to a light blue. He stood and said hoarsely\u2026\u201d  \n   Here Tass hasn\u2019t yet toggled his helmet or changed dialect; he\u2019s simply reeling emotionally at unexpected news. A sudden pale-blue mirror to human paling in disbelief.  \n\n2. Mortification at diplomatic gaffe  \n   Though the narrative doesn\u2019t restate his color in that scene, his self-reproach\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve gone and put me foot in it again. I\u2019ll be after getting kert for this.\u201d\u2014is the exact kind of embarrassment that in human terms causes flushing or paling. The story\u2019s established pattern (purple for normal, blue when distressed) implies that pallor.  \n\n3. Wistful longing at the horse\u2019s departure  \n   \u201cThe alien\u2019s face faded a light blue again\u2026 \u2018I should\u2019ve been a-knowin\u2019 something was queer\u2026\u2019\u201d  \n   No language shift here\u2014Tass is lamenting the loss of his favorite specimen. His hue shift is a direct emotional response: regret and sorrow.  \n\nIII. Textual silence on purely linguistic color codes  \n1. No mention of a special \u201cCarthisian purple\u201d vs. \u201cEnglish blue\u201d anywhere. The only times the narrator flags color are when Tass\u2019s psyche is jarred.  \n2. When he speaks English without surprise\u2014e.g., his \u201cGlork\u201d exchange\u2014no color shift is noted. If every English sentence carried a hue, the author would mention it, yet he does not.  \n\nIV. Physiological analogy and narrative intent  \n1. The story consistently uses color-change as an emotional barometer: first blush of wonder, then pale blue of shock or disappointment. That mirrors human physiology, cementing the emotional cause.  \n2. The kerit helmet\u2019s sole function is translation; nowhere does the text intimate that it alters his biology beyond giving him language.  \n\nConclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s language-mode hypothesis collapses under scrutiny: there is no stable mapping of tongues to tints, and color changes occur precisely at emotional turning points\u2014even in the absence of any language change or helmet use. Only the emotion-driven model accounts for every documented shift. Therefore, Dameri Tass\u2019s face changes color in direct response to his feelings.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
