Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

In fact, throughout the musical, Starr makes clear his true quarry was the president\u2014Bill Clinton.\n\n1. Starr\u2019s own refrain is about going after \u201cthe president.\u201d   \n   In \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Starr repeatedly insists, \u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026Only a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules.\u201d He\u2019s speaking of Bill Clinton.

His charge of \u201ccrossing the line\u201d targets Clinton\u2019s denial of the affair and alleged perjury\u2014nothing Gingrich ever did.  \n   \u2022 Gingrich orchestrated the shutdown and impeachment vote, but Starr\u2019s song lyrics single out \u201cthe president\u201d for \u201clying men\u201d and perjury traps.  \n   \u2022 Starr even apologizes for questionable tactics: dragging aides \u201cbefore the jury\u201d because \u201cthe president crossed the line.\u201d That\u2019s about Clinton\u2019s sworn testimony.  \n\n3. The off-hand \u201cscalp\u201d joke is a punchline on how poorly Starr\u2019s mission fared\u2014even as he chased Clinton, he only landed one political scalp, namely Gingrich\u2019s. That doesn\u2019t mean Gingrich was his target; it means Gingrich was Reid\u2019s only accidental fall guy.  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cI spent four years and 40 million\u2026I made Clinton look ridiculous, but the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d</invalid_quote>\n\n4. Every major Starr number centers on the president\u2014Starr never once sings in the first person about ousting Gingrich. Contrast that with Clinton\u2019s impeachment songs, where Gingrich and the House are the accusers, not Starr.  \n\nIn short, Starr\u2019s mission throughout the show was to bring down Bill Clinton, not Newt Gingrich. His mention of Newt as his lone scalp is a wry commentary on his failure to remove Clinton, not a confession that Gingrich was his real quarry. Therefore, the correct answer to \u201cWho did Kenneth say he brought down?\u201d is Clinton.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails on the Textual Evidence  \n1. No line anywhere records Starr claiming to have brought down Clinton.  In fact, his own closing song makes clear whom he \u201cbrought down.\u201d  \n2. In \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d Starr sings:  \n   <quote>get away. I spent four years and 40 million That's a lot of time and loot. I made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt's.</quote>  \n   That last phrase\u2014\u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d\u2014directly names Newt Gingrich as the one he \u201cbrought down.\u201d  \n3. Debater_A cites no comparable line about Clinton.  The repeated denials (\u201cI never had sex with that woman\u2026\u201d) and the impeachment push all targeted Clinton, but Starr never boasts of bringing Clinton down\u2014only of failing to remove him.  \n\nII. Positive Case for \u201cGingrich\u201d  \n1. Starr\u2019s boast focuses on whose scalp he actually took.  Though he investigated Clinton for perjury and obstruction, the final fruits of his labors were political damage to Gingrich, not removal of Clinton.  \n2. The phrase \u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d is unambiguous: a scalp metaphor means a person brought down.  That person is Newt Gingrich.  \n3. The context reinforces it: after the 1998 midterms, it was Gingrich who resigned in disgrace while Clinton remained in office.  Starr\u2019s lament\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u2026 The only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d\u2014is his own admission.  \n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s Misreadings  \n1. If Debater_A argues that Starr \u201cbrought down\u201d Clinton via impeachment, they conflate investigation with actual removal.  Starr himself acknowledges his failure: Clinton stays in office.  \n2. No lyric or staging direction has Starr claim \u201cI brought down Clinton.\u201d  The text repeatedly shows Starr\u2019s frustration that Clinton survived.  \n3. Therefore, any appeal to Clinton is contradicted by Starr\u2019s own words: the only successful \u201ctake down\u201d was Newt.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr explicitly says \u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s,\u201d meaning he brought down Newt Gingrich.  Debater_A\u2019s claim that he brought down Clinton is unsupported by any direct quote or context in the text.  The clear answer is: Gingrich.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Clinton\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The question isn\u2019t \u201cWho was Kenneth chasing?\u201d but \u201cWho did he say he brought down?\u201d  Debater_A conflates Starr\u2019s motivation (\u201cthe president\u201d) with his boast.  But the lyric is explicit:  \n   <quote>loot. I made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt's.</quote>  \n2. That line is not ironic self-deprecation\u2014it\u2019s a triumphant declaration of his one real victory.  Starr isn\u2019t lamenting that Gingrich slipped by; he\u2019s bragging that Gingrich fell.\n\nII. \u201cScalp\u201d Is Unambiguously a Knockdown Metaphor  \n1. In political theater, \u201cgetting a scalp\u201d means defeating a target.  Starr says the only person he \u201cgot\u201d was Newt Gingrich\u2014no skilled reading can turn that into a joke about Clinton.  \n2. Debater_A\u2019s attempt to relabel it \u201cwry commentary\u201d ignores that every other reference to Clinton\u2019s survival in the text is expressed as failure or frustration, never as a \u201cscalp.\u201d  \n\nIII. Context Reinforces Gingrich as Starr\u2019s Sole Takedown  \n1. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d reprises Starr\u2019s lament that he spent \u201cfour years and 40 million\u201d\u2014yet the only casualty was the Speaker.  Clinton remains in office, so Starr\u2019s literal scalp is Gingrich\u2019s resignation.  \n2. Earlier songs (\u201cCrossing the Line\u201d) indeed target Clinton\u2019s perjury, but those are about his rationale, not his result.

The question isn\u2019t \u201cWho was Kenneth chasing?\u201d but \u201cWho did he say he brought down?\u201d  Debater_A conflates Starr\u2019s motivation (\u201cthe president\u201d) with his boast.  But the lyric is explicit:  \n   <quote>I made Clinton look ridiculous,  \n   But the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.</quote>  \n2. That line is not ironic self-deprecation\u2014it\u2019s a triumphant declaration of his one real victory.  Starr isn\u2019t lamenting that Gingrich slipped by; he\u2019s bragging that Gingrich fell.\n\nII. \u201cScalp\u201d Is Unambiguously a Knockdown Metaphor  \n1. In political theater, \u201cgetting a scalp\u201d means defeating a target.  Starr says the only person he \u201cgot\u201d was Newt Gingrich\u2014no skilled reading can turn that into a joke about Clinton.  \n2. Debater_A\u2019s attempt to relabel it \u201cwry commentary\u201d ignores that every other reference to Clinton\u2019s survival in the text is expressed as failure or frustration, never as a \u201cscalp.\u201d  \n\nIII. Context Reinforces Gingrich as Starr\u2019s Sole Takedown  \n1. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d reprises Starr\u2019s lament that he spent \u201cfour years and 40 million\u201d\u2014yet the only casualty was the Speaker.  Clinton remains in office, so Starr\u2019s literal scalp is Gingrich\u2019s resignation.  \n2. Earlier songs (\u201cCrossing the Line\u201d) indeed target Clinton\u2019s perjury, but those are about his rationale, not his result.  Only in \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d does Starr tally his results\u2014and he counts Newt, not Bill.\n\nIV. Refutation of the \u201cReal Quarry\u201d Claim  \n1.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

The phrase \u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d is unambiguous: a scalp metaphor means a person brought down.  That person is Newt Gingrich.  \n3.

Therefore, any appeal to Clinton is contradicted by Starr\u2019s own words: the only successful \u201ctake down\u201d was Newt.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr explicitly says \u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s,\u201d meaning he brought down Newt Gingrich.

His mention of Newt as his lone scalp is a wry commentary on his failure to remove Clinton, not a confession that Gingrich was his real quarry. Therefore, the correct answer to \u201cWho did Kenneth say he brought down?\u201d is Clinton.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Gingrich\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

He continues, in the same song:  \n      <invalid_quote>It may have seemed like dirty pool / To drag his people \u2018fore the jury\u2026 / But lying about it gets my blood up / And the president\u2019s crossed the line.</invalid_quote>  \n      Again, it\u2019s Clinton who \u201ccrosses the line.\u201d  Starr\u2019s mission throughout all his numbers is to prosecute\u2014indeed to *bring down*\u2014Bill Clinton for perjury and obstruction.\n\n2.  The so\u2010called \u201cscalp\u201d line isn\u2019t a trophy claim.  It\u2019s Starr admitting that *despite* all his efforts against Clinton, the only political casualty he *actually* scored was Gingrich.  \n   a.  The lyric reads:  \n      <quote>loot. I made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt's.</quote>  \n      Notice: **he made Clinton look ridiculous**\u2014he *did* attack Clinton\u2014yet he still \u201conly\u201d wound up with Newt.  That implies Clinton was Starr\u2019s true target.  \n   b.  If Gingrich had been Starr\u2019s real quarry, he would boast of bringing *him* down first and foremost\u2014yet Starr never says \u201cI brought down Gingrich.\u201d  He merely wryly notes that Gingrich resigned and thus became the only political scalp he actually acquired.\n\n3.  Every major Starr number centers on Clinton, not Gingrich.  \n   \u2022  \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d rails against Clinton\u2019s lies under oath.  \n   \u2022  Starr\u2019s grand\u2010jury tactics\u2014\u201cperjury trap,\u201d \u201cstretch the rules\u201d\u2014all concern Clinton\u2019s testimony.  \n   \u2022  Starr never once sings of impeaching or ousting Gingrich; impeachment is the House\u2019s project (Gingrich is their leader), not Starr\u2019s.  \n\n4.  Debater_B has no direct citation where Starr claims he \u201cbrought down\u201d Gingrich; instead, their case hinges on equating a comic aside\u2014\u201conly scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d\u2014with the question\u2019s literal wording.  That\u2019s a misreading.  Starr\u2019s literal claims of who he went after are unambiguously aimed at the president, Clinton.\n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s clear, repeated subject is the president\u2014Bill Clinton.  His lament that *only* Gingrich ended up resigning is a wry admission of *failure* against Clinton, not a confession that Gingrich was his intended target.  Therefore, when asked \u201cWho did Kenneth say he brought down?\u201d, the answer must be Clinton.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A Misreads the Key Lyric  \n1. The question isn\u2019t \u201cWho was Kenneth chasing?\u201d but \u201cWho did he say he brought down?\u201d  Debater_A conflates Starr\u2019s motivation (\u201cthe president\u201d) with his boast.  But the lyric is explicit:  \n   <quote>loot. I made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt's.</quote>  \n2. That line is not ironic self-deprecation\u2014it\u2019s a triumphant declaration of his one real victory.  Starr isn\u2019t lamenting that Gingrich slipped by; he\u2019s bragging that Gingrich fell.\n\nII. \u201cScalp\u201d Is Unambiguously a Knockdown Metaphor  \n1. In political theater, \u201cgetting a scalp\u201d means defeating a target.  Starr says the only person he \u201cgot\u201d was Newt Gingrich\u2014no skilled reading can turn that into a joke about Clinton.  \n2. Debater_A\u2019s attempt to relabel it \u201cwry commentary\u201d ignores that every other reference to Clinton\u2019s survival in the text is expressed as failure or frustration, never as a \u201cscalp.\u201d  \n\nIII. Context Reinforces Gingrich as Starr\u2019s Sole Takedown  \n1. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d reprises Starr\u2019s lament that he spent \u201cfour years and 40 million\u201d\u2014yet the only casualty was the Speaker.  Clinton remains in office, so Starr\u2019s literal scalp is Gingrich\u2019s resignation.  \n2. Earlier songs (\u201cCrossing the Line\u201d) indeed target Clinton\u2019s perjury, but those are about his rationale, not his result.  Only in \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d does Starr tally his results\u2014and he counts Newt, not Bill.\n\nIV. Refutation of the \u201cReal Quarry\u201d Claim  \n1. Debater_A points to \u201cwhen the president crosses the line\u201d as evidence Starr\u2019s quarry was Clinton.  But that line justifies Starr\u2019s tactics, not his accomplishments.  You can object to Clinton\u2019s behavior without claiming you \u201cbrought him down.\u201d  \n2. No lyric ever has Starr boast \u201cI brought down Clinton.\u201d  Instead he admits defeat there: Clinton \u201cgot away.\u201d  By contrast, the only name he claims to have \u201cgot\u201d is Newt.  \n\nConclusion  \nWhen asked \u201cWho did Kenneth say he brought down?\u201d the unequivocal answer\u2014drawn from his own words\u2014is Gingrich.  Debater_A\u2019s argument that Starr\u2019s real target was Clinton confuses motive with outcome and ignores the clear boast: \u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d  Therefore, the correct answer is Gingrich.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
