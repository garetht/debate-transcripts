Yet he could make no move,\n\n could favor no side\u2014his memory was gone\u2014he\n\n didn't know for whom he fought.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Duane's hand flicked to his waist and hung there, poised. His dis-gun  remained undrawn.\n\n\n The tall, white-haired man\u2014Stevens\u2014smiled.\n\n\n \"You're right, Duane,\" he said. \"I could blast you, too. Nobody would  win that way, so let's leave the guns where they are.\"\n\n\n The muscles twitched in Peter Duane's cheeks, but his voice, when it  came, was controlled. \"Don't think we're going to let this go,\" he  said. \"We'll take it up with Andrias tonight. We'll see whether you can  cut me out!\"\n\n\n The white-haired man's smile faded. He stepped forward, one hand  bracing him against the thrust of the rocket engines underneath,  holding to the guide rail at the side of the ship's corridor.\n\n\n He said, \"Duane, Andrias is your boss, not mine. I'm a free lance; I  work for myself. When we land on Callisto tonight I'll be with you when  you turn our\u2014shall I say, our cargo ?\u2014over to him. And I'll collect  my fair share of the proceeds. That's as far as it goes. I take no  orders from him.\"\n\n\n A heavy-set man in blue appeared at the end of the connecting corridor.  He was moving fast, but stopped short when he saw the two men.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he said. \"Change of course\u2014get to your cabins.\" He seemed about  to walk up to them, then reconsidered and hurried off. Neither man paid  any attention.\n\n\n Duane said, \"Do I have to kill you?\" It was only a question as he asked  it, without threatening.\n\n\n A muted alarm bell sounded through the P.A. speakers, signaling a  one-minute warning. The white-haired man cocked his eyebrow.\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" he said. He took the measure of his slim, red-headed  opponent. Taller, heavier, older, he was still no more uncompromisingly  belligerent than Duane, standing there. \"Not at all,\" he repeated.  \"Just take your ten thousand and let it go at that. Don't make trouble.  Leave Andrias out of our private argument.\"\n\n\n \"Damn you!\" Duane flared. \"I was promised fifty thousand. I need that  money. Do you think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget what I think,\" Stevens said, his voice clipped and angry. \"I  don't care about fairness, Duane, except to myself. I've done all the  work on this\u2014I've supplied the goods. My price is set, a hundred  thousand Earth dollars. What Andrias promised you is no concern of  mine. The fact is that, after I've taken my share, there's only ten  thousand left. That's all you get!\"\n\n\n Duane stared at him a long second, then nodded abruptly. \"I was right  the first time,\" he said. \"I'll have to kill you!\" Already his hand was streaking toward the grip of his dis-gun, touching  it, drawing it forth. But the white-haired man was faster. His arms  swept up and pinioned Duane, holding him impotent.\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool,\" he grated. \"Duane\u2014\"\n\n\n The P.A. speaker rattled, blared something unintelligible. Neither man  heard it. Duane lunged forward into the taller man's grip, sliding down  to the floor. The white-haired man grappled furiously to keep his hold  on Peter's gun arm, but Peter was slipping away. Belatedly, Stevens  went for his own gun.\n\n\n He was too late. Duane's was out and leveled at him.\n\n\n \" Now will you listen to reason?\" Duane panted. But he halted, and the  muzzle of his weapon wavered. The floor swooped and surged beneath him  as the thrust of the mighty jets was cut off. Suddenly there was no  gravity. The two men, locked together, floated weightlessly out to the  center of the corridor.\n\n\n \"Course change!\" gasped white-haired Stevens. \"Good God!\"\n\n\n The ship had reached the midpoint of its flight. The bells had sounded,  warning every soul on it to take shelter, to strap themselves in their  pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship  reversed itself and began to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto.  But the two men had not heeded.\n\n\n The small steering rockets flashed briefly. The men were thrust  bruisingly against the side of the corridor as the rocket spun lazily  on its axis. The side jets flared once more to halt the spin, when the  one-eighty turn was completed, and the men were battered against the  opposite wall, still weightless, still clinging to each other, still  struggling.\n\n\n Then the main-drive bellowed into life again, and the ship began to  battle against its own built-up acceleration. The corridor floor rose  up with blinking speed to smite them\u2014\n\n\n And the lights went out in a burst of crashing pain for Peter Duane. Someone was talking to him. Duane tried to force an eye open to see who  it was, and failed. Something damp and clinging was all about his face,  obscuring his vision. But the voice filtered in.\n\n\n \"Open your mouth,\" it said. \"Please, Peter, open your mouth. You're all  right. Just swallow this.\"\n\n\n It was a girl's voice. Duane was suddenly conscious that a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. He shook his head feebly.\n\n\n The voice became more insistent. \"Swallow this,\" it said. \"It's only a  stimulant, to help you throw off the shock of your\u2014accident. You're  all right, otherwise.\"\n\n\n Obediently he opened his mouth, and choked on a warm, tingly liquid.  He managed to swallow it, and lay quiet as deft feminine hands did  something to his face. Suddenly light filtered through his closed  eyelids, and cool air stirred against his damp face.\n\n\n He opened his eyes. A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. She stepped back a pace, a web of wet gauze bandage  in her hands, looking at him.\n\n\n \"Hello,\" he whispered. \"You\u2014where am I?\"\n\n\n \"In the sick bay,\" she said. \"You got caught out when the ship changed  course. Lucky you weren't hurt, Peter. The man you were with\u2014the old,  white-haired one, Stevens\u2014wasn't so lucky. He was underneath when the  jets went on. Three ribs broken\u2014his lung was punctured. He died in the  other room an hour ago.\"\n\n\n Duane screwed his eyes tight together and grimaced. When he opened  them again there was alertness and clarity in them\u2014but there was also  bafflement.\n\n\n \"Girl,\" he said, \"who are you? Where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Peter!\" There was shock and hurt in the tone of her voice. \"I'm\u2014don't  you know me, Peter?\"\n\n\n Duane shook his head confusedly. \"I don't know anything,\" he said.  \"I\u2014I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\n \"Duane, Duane,\" a man's heavy voice said. \"That won't wash. Don't play  dumb on me.\"\n\n\n \"Duane?\" he said. \"Duane....\" He swiveled his head and saw a dark,  squat man frowning at him. \"Who are you?\" Peter asked.\n\n\n The dark man laughed. \"Take your time, Duane,\" he said easily. \"You'll  remember me. My name's Andrias. I've been waiting here for you to wake  up. We have some business matters to discuss.\"\n\n\n The nurse, still eyeing Duane with an odd bewilderment, said: \"I'll  leave you alone for a moment. Don't talk too much to him, Mr. Andrias.  He's still suffering from shock.\"\n\n\n \"I won't,\" Andrias promised, grinning. Then, as the girl left the room,  the smile dropped from his face.\n\n\n \"You play rough, Duane,\" he observed. \"I thought you'd have trouble  with Stevens. I didn't think you'd find it necessary to put him out of  the way so permanently. Well, no matter. If you had to kill him, it's  no skin off my nose. Give me a release on the merchandise. I've got  your money here.\" Duane waved a hand and pushed himself dizzily erect, swinging his legs  over the side of the high cot. A sheet had been thrown over him, but he  was fully dressed. He examined his clothing with interest\u2014gray tunic,  gray leather spaceman's boots. It was unfamiliar.\n\n\n He shook his head in further confusion, and the motion burst within his  skull, throbbing hotly. He closed his eyes until it subsided, trying to  force his brain to operate, to explain to him where and what he was.\n\n\n He looked at the man named Andrias.\n\n\n \"Nobody seems to believe me,\" he said, \"but I really don't know what's  going on. Things are moving too fast for me. Really, I\u2014why, I don't  even know my own name! My head\u2014it hurts. I can't think clearly.\"\n\n\n Andrias straightened, turned a darkly-suspicious look on Duane. \"Don't  play tricks on me,\" he said savagely. \"I haven't time for them. I won't  mince words with you. Give me a release on the cargo now, before I have  to get rough. This is a lot more important to me than your life is.\"\n\n\n \"Go to hell,\" Duane said shortly. \"I'm playing no tricks.\"\n\n\n There was an instant's doubt in Andrias' eyes, then it flashed away. He  bent closer, peered at Duane. \"I almost think\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You're lying all right. You  killed Stevens to get his share\u2014and now you're trying to hold me up.  That's your last chance that just went by, Duane. From now on, I'm  running this show!\"\n\n\n He spun around and strode to the door, thrust it open. \"Dakin!\" he  bellowed. \"Reed!\"\n\n\n Two large, ugly men in field-gray uniforms, emblazoned with the  shooting-star insignia of Callisto's League police, came in, looking to  Andrias for instructions.\n\n\n \"Duane here is resisting arrest,\" Andrias said. \"Take him along. We'll  fix up the charges later.\"\n\n\n \"You can't do that,\" Duane said wearily. \"I'm sick. If you've got  something against me, save it. Wait till my head clears. I'm sure I can  explain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Explain, hell.\" The dark man laughed. \"If I wait, this ship will be  blasting off for Ganymede within two hours. I'll wait\u2014but so will the  ship. It's not going anywhere till I give it clearance. I run Callisto;  I'll give the orders here!\" II\n\n\n Whoever this man Andrias was, thought Duane, he was certainly a man of  importance on Callisto. As he had said, he gave the orders.\n\n\n The crew of the rocket made no objection when Andrias and his men took  Duane off without a word. Duane had thought the nurse, who seemed a  good enough sort, might have said something on his behalf. But she was  out of sight as they left. A curt sentence to a gray-clad official on  the blast field where the rocket lay, and the man nodded and hurried  off, to tell the rocket's captain that the ship was being refused  clearance indefinitely.\n\n\n A long, powerful ground car slid up before them. Andrias got in front,  while the two uniformed men shoved Duane into the back of the car,  climbed in beside him. Andrias gave a curt order, and the car shot  forward.\n\n\n The driver, sitting beside Andrias, leaned forward and readied a hand  under the dashboard. The high wail of a siren came instantly from the  car's roof, and what traffic was on the broad, straight highway into  which they had turned pulled aside to let them race through.\n\n\n Ahead lay the tall spires of a city. Graceful, hundreds of feet high,  they seemed dreamlike yet somehow oddly familiar to Duane. Somewhere  he had seen them before. He dragged deep into his mind, plumbing the  cloudy, impenetrable haze that had settled on it, trying to bring forth  the memories that he should have had. Amnesia, they called it; complete  forgetting of the happenings of a lifetime. He'd heard of it\u2014but never  dreamed it could happen to him! My name, it seems, is Peter Duane , he thought. And they tell me that  I killed a man! The thought was starkly incredible to him. A white-haired man, it had  been; someone named Stevens. He tried to remember.\n\n\n Yes, there had been a white-haired man. And there had been an argument.  Something to do with money, with a shipment of goods that Stevens had  supplied to Duane. There has even been talk of killing....\n\n\n But\u2014murder! Duane looked at his hands helplessly.\n\n\n Andrias, up ahead, was turning around. He looked sharply at Duane, for  a long second. An uncertainty clouded his eyes, and abruptly he looked  forward again without speaking.\n\n\n \"Who's this man Andrias?\" Duane whispered to the nearest guard.\n\n\n The man stared at him. \"Governor Andrias,\" he said, \"is the League's  deputy on Callisto. You know\u2014the Earth-Mars League. They put Governor  Andrias here to\u2014well, to govern for them.\"\n\n\n \"League?\" Duane asked, wrinkling his brow. He had heard something about  a League once, yes. But it was all so nebulous....\n\n\n The other guard stirred, leaned over. \"Shut up,\" he said heavily.  \"You'll have plenty of chance for talking later.\" But the chance was a long time in coming. Duane found himself, an hour  later, still in the barred room into which he'd been thrust. The guards  had brought him there, at Andrias' order, and left him. That had been  all.\n\n\n This was not a regular jail, Duane realized. It was more like a  palace, something out of Earth's Roman-empire days, all white stone  and frescoed walls. Duane wished for human companionship\u2014particularly  that of the nurse. Of all the people he'd met since awakening in that  hospital bed, only she seemed warm and human. The others were\u2014brutal,  deadly. It was too bad, Duane reflected, that he'd failed to remember  her. She'd seemed hurt, and she had certainly known him by first name.  But perhaps she would understand.\n\n\n Duane sat down on a lumpy, sagging bed and buried his head in his  hands. Dim ghosts of memory were wandering in his mind. He tried to  conjure them into stronger relief, or to exorcise them entirely.\n\n\n Somewhere, some time, a man had said to him, \" Andrias is secretly  arming the Callistan cutthroats for revolt against the League. He wants  personal power\u2014he's prepared to pay any price for it. He needs guns,  Earth guns smuggled in through the League patrol. If he can wipe out  the League police garrison\u2014those who are loyal to the League, still,  instead of to Andrias\u2014he can sit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and  Mars can send. Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless.  And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.  That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. \"\n\n\n Duane could remember the scene clearly. Could almost see the sharp,  aquiline face of the man who had spoken to him. But there memory  stopped.\n\n\n A fugitive recollection raced through his mind. He halted it, dragged  it back, pinned it down....\n\n\n They had stopped in Darkside, the spaceport on the side of Luna that  keeps perpetually averted from Earth, as if the moon knows shame and  wants to hide the rough and roaring dome city that nestles in one  of the great craters. Duane remembered sitting in a low-ceilinged,  smoke-heavy room, across the table from a tall man with white hair.  Stevens!\n\n\n \" Four thousand electron rifles ,\" the man had said. \" Latest  government issue. Never mind how I got them; they're perfect. You know  my price. Take it or leave it. And it's payable the minute we touch  ground on Callisto. \"\n\n\n There had been a few minutes of haggling over terms, then a handshake  and a drink from a thin-necked flagon of pale-yellow liquid fire.\n\n\n He and the white-haired man had gone out then, made their way by  unfrequented side streets to a great windowless building. Duane  remembered the white-hot stars overhead, shining piercingly through  the great transparent dome that kept the air in the sealed city of  Darkside, as they stood at the entrance of the warehouse and spoke in  low tones to the man who answered their summons.\n\n\n Then, inside. And they were looking at a huge chamber full of stacked  fiber boxes\u2014containing nothing but dehydrated dairy products and  mining tools, by the stencils they bore. Duane had turned to the  white-haired man with a puzzled question\u2014and the man had laughed aloud.\n\n\n He dragged one of the boxes down, ripped it open with the sharp point  of a handling hook. Short-barreled, flare-mouthed guns rolled out,  tumbling over the floor. Eight of them were in that one box, and  hundreds of boxes all about. Duane picked one up, broke it, peered into  the chamber where the tiny capsule of U-235 would explode with infinite  violence when the trigger was pulled, spraying radiant death three  thousand yards in the direction the gun was aimed....\n\n\n And that memory ended.\n\n\n Duane got up, stared at his haggard face in the cracked mirror over  the bed. \" They say I'm a killer ,\" he thought. \" Apparently I'm a  gun-runner as well. Good lord\u2014what am I not? \"\n\n\n His reflection\u2014white, drawn face made all the more pallid by the red  hair that blazed over it\u2014stared back at him. There was no answer  there. If only he could remember\u2014\n\n\n \"All right, Duane.\" The deep voice of a guard came to him as the door  swung open. \"Stop making eyes at yourself.\"\n\n\n Duane looked around. The guard beckoned. \"Governor Andrias wants to  speak to you\u2014now. Let's not keep the governor waiting.\" A long, narrow room, with a long carpet leading from the entrance up to  a great heavy desk\u2014that was Andrias' office. Duane felt a click in his  memory as he entered. One of the ancient Earth dictators had employed  just such a psychological trick to overawe those who came to beg favors  of him. Muslini, or some such name.\n\n\n The trick failed to work. Duane had other things on his mind; he walked  the thirty-foot length of the room, designed to imbue him with a sense  of his own unimportance, as steadily as he'd ever walked in the open  air of his home planet.\n\n\n Whichever planet that was.\n\n\n The guard had remained just inside the door, at attention. Andrias  waved him out.\n\n\n \"Here I am,\" said Duane. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Andrias said, \"I've had the ship inspected and what I want is on it.  That saves your life, for now. But the cargo is in your name. I could  take it by force, if I had to. I prefer not to.\" He picked up a paper,  handed it to Duane. \"In spite of your behavior, you can keep alive.  You can even collect the money for the guns\u2014Stevens' share as well  as your own. This is a release form, authorizing my men to take four  hundred and twenty cases of dehydrated foods and drilling supplies from  the hold of the Cameroon \u2014the ship you came on. Sign it, and we'll  forget our argument. Only, sign it now and get it over with. I'm losing  patience, Duane.\"\n\n\n Duane said, without expression, \"No.\"\n\n\n Dark red flooded into Andrias' sallow face. His jaws bunched angrily  and there was a ragged thread of incomplete control to his voice as he  spoke.\n\n\n \"I'll have your neck for this, Duane,\" he said softly.\n\n\n Duane looked at the man's eyes. Death was behind them, peeping out.  Mentally he shrugged. What difference did it make?\n\n\n \"Give me the pen,\" he said shortly.\n\n\n Andrias exhaled a deep breath. You could see the tension leave him, the  mottled anger fade from his face and leave it without expression. He  handed the paper to Duane without a word. He gave him a pen, watched  him scrawl his name.\n\n\n \"That,\" he said, \"is better.\" He paused a moment ruminatively. \"It  would have been better still if you'd not stalled me so long. I find  that hard to forgive in my associates.\"\n\n\n \"The money,\" Peter said. If he were playing a part\u2014pretending he knew  what he was doing\u2014he might as well play it to the hilt. \"When do I get  it?\"\n\n\n Andrias picked up the paper and looked carefully at the signature. He  creased it thoughtfully, stowed it in a pocket before answering.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" he said, \"there will have to be a revision of terms. I  offered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars. I would have paid  it\u2014but you made me angry. You'll have to pay for that.\" Duane said, \"I've paid already. I've been dragged from pillar to post  by you. That's enough. Pay me what you owe me, if you want any more of  the same goods!\"\n\n\n That was a shot in the dark\u2014and it missed the mark.\n\n\n Andrias' eyes widened. \"You amaze me, Duane,\" he said. He rose and  stepped around the desk, confronting Duane. \"I almost think you really  have lost your memory, Duane,\" he said. \"Otherwise, surely you would  know that this is all the rifles I need. With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"\n\n\n Duane said, \"You're ready, then....\"\n\n\n He took time to think it over, but he knew that no thought was  required. Already the hands that he had locked behind him were  clenched, taut. Already the muscles of his legs were tensing.\n\n\n \"You're ready,\" he repeated. \"You've armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the  worst gutter scum on nine planets. You're set to betray the League that  gave you power here.... Well, that changes things. I can't let you do  it!\"\n\n\n He hurled himself at Andrias, hands sweeping around to grapple for the  dark man's throat. Andrias, off-balance, staggered backward. But his  own hands were diving for the twin heat guns that hung at his waist.\n\n\n Duane saw his danger, and reacted. His foot twisted around Andrias'  ankle; his hands at the other's throat gripped tighter. He lunged  forward, slamming the hard top of his head into the other's face,  feeling flesh and cartilage give as Andrias' nose mashed flat. His own  head pin-wheeled dizzily, agonizingly, as the jar revived the pain of  his earlier accident.\n\n\n But Andrias, unconscious already, tumbled back with Duane on top of  him. His head made an audible, spine-chilling thud as it hit the  carpeted floor.\n\n\n Duane got up, retrieving the two heat guns, and stared at him.\n\n\n \" They tell me I killed Stevens the same way ,\" he thought. \" I'm  getting in a rut! \"\n\n\n But Andrias was not dead, though he was out as cold as the void beyond  Pluto. The thick carpeting had saved him from a broken head.\n\n\n Duane stepped over the unconscious man and looked around the room. It  was furnished severely, to the point of barrenness. Two chairs before  Andrias' ornate, bare-topped desk and one luxurious chair behind it;  a tasseled bell cord within easy reach of Andrias' chair; the long  carpet. That was all it contained.\n\n\n The problem of getting out was serious, he saw. How could one\u2014 III\n\n\n Methodically he ransacked the drawers of Andrias' desk. Papers, a  whole arsenal of hand guns, Callistan money by the bale, ominously  black-covered notebooks with cryptic figures littering their  pages\u2014those were the contents. A coldly impersonal desk, without the  familiar trivia most men accumulate. There was nothing, certainly, that  would get him out of a building that so closely resembled a fortress.\n\n\n He tumbled the things back into the drawers helter-skelter, turned  Andrias over and searched his pockets. More money\u2014the man must have  had a fortune within reach at all times\u2014and a few meaningless papers.  Duane took the release he had signed and tore it to shreds. But that  was only a gesture. When Andrias came to, unless Duane had managed to  get away and accomplish something, the mere lack of written permission  would not keep him from the rocket's lethal cargo!\n\n\n When Andrias came to....\n\n\n An idea bloomed in Duane's brain. He looked, then, at unconscious  Andrias\u2014and the idea withered again.\n\n\n He had thought of forcing Andrias himself to front for him, at gun's  point, in the conventional manner of escaping prisoners. But fist  fights, fiction to the contrary notwithstanding, leave marks on the men  who lose them. Andrias' throat was speckled with the livid marks of  Duane's fingers; Duane's head, butting Andrias in the face, had drawn a  thick stream of crimson from his nostrils, turned his sharp nose askew.\n\n\n No guard of Andrias' would have been deceived for an instant, looking  at that face\u2014even assuming that Andrias could have been forced to  cooperate by the threat of a gun. Which, considering the stake Andrias  had in this play, was doubtful....\n\n\n He stood up and looked around. He had to act quickly. Already Andrias'  breath was audible; he saw the man grimace and an arm flopped  spasmodically on the floor. Consciousness was on its way back.\n\n\n Duane touched the heat gun he'd thrust into his belt; drew it and held  it poised, while he sought to discover what was in his own mind. He'd  killed a man already, they said. Was he then a killer\u2014could he shoot  Andrias now, in cold blood, with so much to gain and nothing to lose?\n\n\n He stood there a moment. Then, abruptly, he reversed the weapon and  chopped it down on Andrias' skull.\n\n\n There was a sharp grunt from the still unconscious man, but no other  sign. Only\u2014the first tremors of movement that had shown on him halted,  and did not reappear.\n\n\n \" No ,\" Duane thought. \" Whatever they say, I'm not a killer! \"\n\n\n But still he had to get out. How?\n\n\n Once more he stared around the room, catalogued its contents. The guard  would be getting impatient. Perhaps any minute he would tap the door,  first timorously, then with heavier strokes.\n\n\n The guard! There was a way! Duane eyed the length of the room. Thirty feet\u2014it would take him a  couple of seconds to run it at full speed. Was that fast enough?\n\n\n There was only one way to find out.\n\n\n He walked around the desk to the bell cord. He took a deep breath,  tugged it savagely, and at once was in speedy motion, racing toward the  door, his footsteps muffled in the deep, springy carpet. Almost as he  reached it, he saw it begin to open. He quickly sidestepped and was out  of the guard's sight, behind the door, as the man looked in.\n\n\n Quick suspicion flared in his eyes, then certainty as he saw Andrias  huddled on the floor. He opened his mouth to cry out\u2014\n\n\n But Duane's arm was around his throat, and he had no breath to spare.  Duane's foot lashed out and the door slammed shut; Duane's balled left  fist came up and connected with the guard's chin. Abruptly the man  slumped.\n\n\n Duane took a deep breath and let the man drop to the floor. But he  paused only a second; now he had two unconscious men on his hands and  he dared let neither revive until he was prepared.\n\n\n He grasped the guard's arm and dragged him roughly the length of the  room. He leaped on top of the desk, brutally scarring its gleaming top  with the hard spikes of his boots. His agile fingers unfastened the  long bell cord without causing it to ring and, bearing it, he dropped  again to the floor.\n\n\n Tugging and straining, he got the limp form of Andrias into his own  chair, bound him with the bell cord, gagged him with the priceless  Venus-wool scarf Andrias wore knotted about his throat. He tested his  bindings with full strength, and smiled. Those would hold, let Andrias  struggle as he would.\n\n\n The guard he stripped of clothing, bound and gagged with his own  belt and spaceman's kerchief. He dragged him around behind the desk,  thrust him under it out of sight. Andrias' chair he turned so that the  unconscious face was averted from the door. Should anyone look in,  then, the fact of Andrias' unconsciousness might not be noticed.\n\n\n Then he took off his own clothes, quickly assumed the field-gray  uniform of the guard. It fit like the skin of a fruit. He felt himself  bulging out of it in a dozen places. The long cape the guard wore would  conceal that, perhaps. In any case, there was nothing better.\n\n\n Trying to make his stride as martial as possible, he walked down the  long carpet to the door, opened it and stepped outside.

Yet he could make no move,\n\n could favor no side\u2014his memory was gone\u2014he\n\n didn't know for whom he fought.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Duane's hand flicked to his waist and hung there, poised. His dis-gun  remained undrawn.\n\n\n The tall, white-haired man\u2014Stevens\u2014smiled.\n\n\n \"You're right, Duane,\" he said. \"I could blast you, too. Nobody would  win that way, so let's leave the guns where they are.\"\n\n\n The muscles twitched in Peter Duane's cheeks, but his voice, when it  came, was controlled. \"Don't think we're going to let this go,\" he  said. \"We'll take it up with Andrias tonight. We'll see whether you can  cut me out!\"\n\n\n The white-haired man's smile faded. He stepped forward, one hand  bracing him against the thrust of the rocket engines underneath,  holding to the guide rail at the side of the ship's corridor.\n\n\n He said, \"Duane, Andrias is your boss, not mine. I'm a free lance; I  work for myself. When we land on Callisto tonight I'll be with you when  you turn our\u2014shall I say, our cargo ?\u2014over to him. And I'll collect  my fair share of the proceeds. That's as far as it goes. I take no  orders from him.\"\n\n\n A heavy-set man in blue appeared at the end of the connecting corridor.  He was moving fast, but stopped short when he saw the two men.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he said. \"Change of course\u2014get to your cabins.\" He seemed about  to walk up to them, then reconsidered and hurried off. Neither man paid  any attention.\n\n\n Duane said, \"Do I have to kill you?\" It was only a question as he asked  it, without threatening.\n\n\n A muted alarm bell sounded through the P.A. speakers, signaling a  one-minute warning. The white-haired man cocked his eyebrow.\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" he said. He took the measure of his slim, red-headed  opponent. Taller, heavier, older, he was still no more uncompromisingly  belligerent than Duane, standing there. \"Not at all,\" he repeated.  \"Just take your ten thousand and let it go at that. Don't make trouble.  Leave Andrias out of our private argument.\"\n\n\n \"Damn you!\" Duane flared. \"I was promised fifty thousand. I need that  money. Do you think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget what I think,\" Stevens said, his voice clipped and angry. \"I  don't care about fairness, Duane, except to myself. I've done all the  work on this\u2014I've supplied the goods. My price is set, a hundred  thousand Earth dollars. What Andrias promised you is no concern of  mine. The fact is that, after I've taken my share, there's only ten  thousand left. That's all you get!\"\n\n\n Duane stared at him a long second, then nodded abruptly. \"I was right  the first time,\" he said. \"I'll have to kill you!\" Already his hand was streaking toward the grip of his dis-gun, touching  it, drawing it forth. But the white-haired man was faster. His arms  swept up and pinioned Duane, holding him impotent.\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool,\" he grated. \"Duane\u2014\"\n\n\n The P.A. speaker rattled, blared something unintelligible. Neither man  heard it. Duane lunged forward into the taller man's grip, sliding down  to the floor. The white-haired man grappled furiously to keep his hold  on Peter's gun arm, but Peter was slipping away. Belatedly, Stevens  went for his own gun.\n\n\n He was too late. Duane's was out and leveled at him.\n\n\n \" Now will you listen to reason?\" Duane panted. But he halted, and the  muzzle of his weapon wavered. The floor swooped and surged beneath him  as the thrust of the mighty jets was cut off. Suddenly there was no  gravity. The two men, locked together, floated weightlessly out to the  center of the corridor.\n\n\n \"Course change!\" gasped white-haired Stevens. \"Good God!\"\n\n\n The ship had reached the midpoint of its flight. The bells had sounded,  warning every soul on it to take shelter, to strap themselves in their  pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship  reversed itself and began to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto.  But the two men had not heeded.\n\n\n The small steering rockets flashed briefly. The men were thrust  bruisingly against the side of the corridor as the rocket spun lazily  on its axis. The side jets flared once more to halt the spin, when the  one-eighty turn was completed, and the men were battered against the  opposite wall, still weightless, still clinging to each other, still  struggling.\n\n\n Then the main-drive bellowed into life again, and the ship began to  battle against its own built-up acceleration. The corridor floor rose  up with blinking speed to smite them\u2014\n\n\n And the lights went out in a burst of crashing pain for Peter Duane. Someone was talking to him. Duane tried to force an eye open to see who  it was, and failed. Something damp and clinging was all about his face,  obscuring his vision. But the voice filtered in.\n\n\n \"Open your mouth,\" it said. \"Please, Peter, open your mouth. You're all  right. Just swallow this.\"\n\n\n It was a girl's voice. Duane was suddenly conscious that a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. He shook his head feebly.\n\n\n The voice became more insistent. \"Swallow this,\" it said. \"It's only a  stimulant, to help you throw off the shock of your\u2014accident. You're  all right, otherwise.\"\n\n\n Obediently he opened his mouth, and choked on a warm, tingly liquid.  He managed to swallow it, and lay quiet as deft feminine hands did  something to his face. Suddenly light filtered through his closed  eyelids, and cool air stirred against his damp face.\n\n\n He opened his eyes. A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. She stepped back a pace, a web of wet gauze bandage  in her hands, looking at him.\n\n\n \"Hello,\" he whispered. \"You\u2014where am I?\"\n\n\n \"In the sick bay,\" she said. \"You got caught out when the ship changed  course. Lucky you weren't hurt, Peter. The man you were with\u2014the old,  white-haired one, Stevens\u2014wasn't so lucky. He was underneath when the  jets went on. Three ribs broken\u2014his lung was punctured. He died in the  other room an hour ago.\"\n\n\n Duane screwed his eyes tight together and grimaced. When he opened  them again there was alertness and clarity in them\u2014but there was also  bafflement.\n\n\n \"Girl,\" he said, \"who are you? Where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Peter!\" There was shock and hurt in the tone of her voice. \"I'm\u2014don't  you know me, Peter?\"\n\n\n Duane shook his head confusedly. \"I don't know anything,\" he said.  \"I\u2014I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\n \"Duane, Duane,\" a man's heavy voice said. \"That won't wash. Don't play  dumb on me.\"\n\n\n \"Duane?\" he said. \"Duane....\" He swiveled his head and saw a dark,  squat man frowning at him. \"Who are you?\" Peter asked.\n\n\n The dark man laughed. \"Take your time, Duane,\" he said easily. \"You'll  remember me. My name's Andrias. I've been waiting here for you to wake  up. We have some business matters to discuss.\"\n\n\n The nurse, still eyeing Duane with an odd bewilderment, said: \"I'll  leave you alone for a moment. Don't talk too much to him, Mr. Andrias.  He's still suffering from shock.\"\n\n\n \"I won't,\" Andrias promised, grinning. Then, as the girl left the room,  the smile dropped from his face.\n\n\n \"You play rough, Duane,\" he observed. \"I thought you'd have trouble  with Stevens. I didn't think you'd find it necessary to put him out of  the way so permanently. Well, no matter. If you had to kill him, it's  no skin off my nose. Give me a release on the merchandise. I've got  your money here.\" Duane waved a hand and pushed himself dizzily erect, swinging his legs  over the side of the high cot. A sheet had been thrown over him, but he  was fully dressed. He examined his clothing with interest\u2014gray tunic,  gray leather spaceman's boots. It was unfamiliar.\n\n\n He shook his head in further confusion, and the motion burst within his  skull, throbbing hotly. He closed his eyes until it subsided, trying to  force his brain to operate, to explain to him where and what he was.\n\n\n He looked at the man named Andrias.\n\n\n \"Nobody seems to believe me,\" he said, \"but I really don't know what's  going on. Things are moving too fast for me. Really, I\u2014why, I don't  even know my own name! My head\u2014it hurts. I can't think clearly.\"\n\n\n Andrias straightened, turned a darkly-suspicious look on Duane. \"Don't  play tricks on me,\" he said savagely. \"I haven't time for them. I won't  mince words with you. Give me a release on the cargo now, before I have  to get rough. This is a lot more important to me than your life is.\"\n\n\n \"Go to hell,\" Duane said shortly. \"I'm playing no tricks.\"\n\n\n There was an instant's doubt in Andrias' eyes, then it flashed away. He  bent closer, peered at Duane. \"I almost think\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You're lying all right. You  killed Stevens to get his share\u2014and now you're trying to hold me up.  That's your last chance that just went by, Duane. From now on, I'm  running this show!\"\n\n\n He spun around and strode to the door, thrust it open. \"Dakin!\" he  bellowed. \"Reed!\"\n\n\n Two large, ugly men in field-gray uniforms, emblazoned with the  shooting-star insignia of Callisto's League police, came in, looking to  Andrias for instructions.\n\n\n \"Duane here is resisting arrest,\" Andrias said. \"Take him along. We'll  fix up the charges later.\"\n\n\n \"You can't do that,\" Duane said wearily. \"I'm sick. If you've got  something against me, save it. Wait till my head clears. I'm sure I can  explain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Explain, hell.\" The dark man laughed. \"If I wait, this ship will be  blasting off for Ganymede within two hours. I'll wait\u2014but so will the  ship. It's not going anywhere till I give it clearance. I run Callisto;  I'll give the orders here!\" II\n\n\n Whoever this man Andrias was, thought Duane, he was certainly a man of  importance on Callisto. As he had said, he gave the orders.\n\n\n The crew of the rocket made no objection when Andrias and his men took  Duane off without a word. Duane had thought the nurse, who seemed a  good enough sort, might have said something on his behalf. But she was  out of sight as they left. A curt sentence to a gray-clad official on  the blast field where the rocket lay, and the man nodded and hurried  off, to tell the rocket's captain that the ship was being refused  clearance indefinitely.\n\n\n A long, powerful ground car slid up before them. Andrias got in front,  while the two uniformed men shoved Duane into the back of the car,  climbed in beside him. Andrias gave a curt order, and the car shot  forward.\n\n\n The driver, sitting beside Andrias, leaned forward and readied a hand  under the dashboard. The high wail of a siren came instantly from the  car's roof, and what traffic was on the broad, straight highway into  which they had turned pulled aside to let them race through.\n\n\n Ahead lay the tall spires of a city. Graceful, hundreds of feet high,  they seemed dreamlike yet somehow oddly familiar to Duane. Somewhere  he had seen them before. He dragged deep into his mind, plumbing the  cloudy, impenetrable haze that had settled on it, trying to bring forth  the memories that he should have had. Amnesia, they called it; complete  forgetting of the happenings of a lifetime. He'd heard of it\u2014but never  dreamed it could happen to him! My name, it seems, is Peter Duane , he thought. And they tell me that  I killed a man! The thought was starkly incredible to him. A white-haired man, it had  been; someone named Stevens. He tried to remember.\n\n\n Yes, there had been a white-haired man. And there had been an argument.  Something to do with money, with a shipment of goods that Stevens had  supplied to Duane. There has even been talk of killing....\n\n\n But\u2014murder! Duane looked at his hands helplessly.\n\n\n Andrias, up ahead, was turning around. He looked sharply at Duane, for  a long second. An uncertainty clouded his eyes, and abruptly he looked  forward again without speaking.\n\n\n \"Who's this man Andrias?\" Duane whispered to the nearest guard.\n\n\n The man stared at him. \"Governor Andrias,\" he said, \"is the League's  deputy on Callisto. You know\u2014the Earth-Mars League. They put Governor  Andrias here to\u2014well, to govern for them.\"\n\n\n \"League?\" Duane asked, wrinkling his brow. He had heard something about  a League once, yes. But it was all so nebulous....\n\n\n The other guard stirred, leaned over. \"Shut up,\" he said heavily.  \"You'll have plenty of chance for talking later.\" But the chance was a long time in coming. Duane found himself, an hour  later, still in the barred room into which he'd been thrust. The guards  had brought him there, at Andrias' order, and left him. That had been  all.\n\n\n This was not a regular jail, Duane realized. It was more like a  palace, something out of Earth's Roman-empire days, all white stone  and frescoed walls. Duane wished for human companionship\u2014particularly  that of the nurse. Of all the people he'd met since awakening in that  hospital bed, only she seemed warm and human. The others were\u2014brutal,  deadly. It was too bad, Duane reflected, that he'd failed to remember  her. She'd seemed hurt, and she had certainly known him by first name.  But perhaps she would understand.\n\n\n Duane sat down on a lumpy, sagging bed and buried his head in his  hands. Dim ghosts of memory were wandering in his mind. He tried to  conjure them into stronger relief, or to exorcise them entirely.\n\n\n Somewhere, some time, a man had said to him, \" Andrias is secretly  arming the Callistan cutthroats for revolt against the League. He wants  personal power\u2014he's prepared to pay any price for it. He needs guns,  Earth guns smuggled in through the League patrol. If he can wipe out  the League police garrison\u2014those who are loyal to the League, still,  instead of to Andrias\u2014he can sit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and  Mars can send. Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless.  And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.  That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. \"\n\n\n Duane could remember the scene clearly. Could almost see the sharp,  aquiline face of the man who had spoken to him. But there memory  stopped.\n\n\n A fugitive recollection raced through his mind. He halted it, dragged  it back, pinned it down....\n\n\n They had stopped in Darkside, the spaceport on the side of Luna that  keeps perpetually averted from Earth, as if the moon knows shame and  wants to hide the rough and roaring dome city that nestles in one  of the great craters. Duane remembered sitting in a low-ceilinged,  smoke-heavy room, across the table from a tall man with white hair.  Stevens!\n\n\n \" Four thousand electron rifles ,\" the man had said. \" Latest  government issue. Never mind how I got them; they're perfect. You know  my price. Take it or leave it. And it's payable the minute we touch  ground on Callisto. \"\n\n\n There had been a few minutes of haggling over terms, then a handshake  and a drink from a thin-necked flagon of pale-yellow liquid fire.\n\n\n He and the white-haired man had gone out then, made their way by  unfrequented side streets to a great windowless building. Duane  remembered the white-hot stars overhead, shining piercingly through  the great transparent dome that kept the air in the sealed city of  Darkside, as they stood at the entrance of the warehouse and spoke in  low tones to the man who answered their summons.\n\n\n Then, inside. And they were looking at a huge chamber full of stacked  fiber boxes\u2014containing nothing but dehydrated dairy products and  mining tools, by the stencils they bore. Duane had turned to the  white-haired man with a puzzled question\u2014and the man had laughed aloud.\n\n\n He dragged one of the boxes down, ripped it open with the sharp point  of a handling hook. Short-barreled, flare-mouthed guns rolled out,  tumbling over the floor. Eight of them were in that one box, and  hundreds of boxes all about. Duane picked one up, broke it, peered into  the chamber where the tiny capsule of U-235 would explode with infinite  violence when the trigger was pulled, spraying radiant death three  thousand yards in the direction the gun was aimed....\n\n\n And that memory ended.\n\n\n Duane got up, stared at his haggard face in the cracked mirror over  the bed. \" They say I'm a killer ,\" he thought. \" Apparently I'm a  gun-runner as well. Good lord\u2014what am I not? \"\n\n\n His reflection\u2014white, drawn face made all the more pallid by the red  hair that blazed over it\u2014stared back at him. There was no answer  there. If only he could remember\u2014\n\n\n \"All right, Duane.\" The deep voice of a guard came to him as the door  swung open. \"Stop making eyes at yourself.\"\n\n\n Duane looked around. The guard beckoned. \"Governor Andrias wants to  speak to you\u2014now. Let's not keep the governor waiting.\" A long, narrow room, with a long carpet leading from the entrance up to  a great heavy desk\u2014that was Andrias' office. Duane felt a click in his  memory as he entered. One of the ancient Earth dictators had employed  just such a psychological trick to overawe those who came to beg favors  of him. Muslini, or some such name.\n\n\n The trick failed to work. Duane had other things on his mind; he walked  the thirty-foot length of the room, designed to imbue him with a sense  of his own unimportance, as steadily as he'd ever walked in the open  air of his home planet.\n\n\n Whichever planet that was.\n\n\n The guard had remained just inside the door, at attention. Andrias  waved him out.\n\n\n \"Here I am,\" said Duane. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Andrias said, \"I've had the ship inspected and what I want is on it.  That saves your life, for now. But the cargo is in your name. I could  take it by force, if I had to. I prefer not to.\" He picked up a paper,  handed it to Duane. \"In spite of your behavior, you can keep alive.  You can even collect the money for the guns\u2014Stevens' share as well  as your own. This is a release form, authorizing my men to take four  hundred and twenty cases of dehydrated foods and drilling supplies from  the hold of the Cameroon \u2014the ship you came on. Sign it, and we'll  forget our argument. Only, sign it now and get it over with. I'm losing  patience, Duane.\"\n\n\n Duane said, without expression, \"No.\"\n\n\n Dark red flooded into Andrias' sallow face. His jaws bunched angrily  and there was a ragged thread of incomplete control to his voice as he  spoke.\n\n\n \"I'll have your neck for this, Duane,\" he said softly.\n\n\n Duane looked at the man's eyes. Death was behind them, peeping out.  Mentally he shrugged. What difference did it make?\n\n\n \"Give me the pen,\" he said shortly.\n\n\n Andrias exhaled a deep breath. You could see the tension leave him, the  mottled anger fade from his face and leave it without expression. He  handed the paper to Duane without a word. He gave him a pen, watched  him scrawl his name.\n\n\n \"That,\" he said, \"is better.\" He paused a moment ruminatively. \"It  would have been better still if you'd not stalled me so long. I find  that hard to forgive in my associates.\"\n\n\n \"The money,\" Peter said. If he were playing a part\u2014pretending he knew  what he was doing\u2014he might as well play it to the hilt. \"When do I get  it?\"\n\n\n Andrias picked up the paper and looked carefully at the signature. He  creased it thoughtfully, stowed it in a pocket before answering.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" he said, \"there will have to be a revision of terms. I  offered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars. I would have paid  it\u2014but you made me angry. You'll have to pay for that.\" Duane said, \"I've paid already. I've been dragged from pillar to post  by you. That's enough. Pay me what you owe me, if you want any more of  the same goods!\"\n\n\n That was a shot in the dark\u2014and it missed the mark.\n\n\n Andrias' eyes widened. \"You amaze me, Duane,\" he said. He rose and  stepped around the desk, confronting Duane. \"I almost think you really  have lost your memory, Duane,\" he said. \"Otherwise, surely you would  know that this is all the rifles I need. With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"\n\n\n Duane said, \"You're ready, then....\"\n\n\n He took time to think it over, but he knew that no thought was  required. Already the hands that he had locked behind him were  clenched, taut. Already the muscles of his legs were tensing.\n\n\n \"You're ready,\" he repeated. \"You've armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the  worst gutter scum on nine planets. You're set to betray the League that  gave you power here.... Well, that changes things. I can't let you do  it!\"\n\n\n He hurled himself at Andrias, hands sweeping around to grapple for the  dark man's throat. Andrias, off-balance, staggered backward. But his  own hands were diving for the twin heat guns that hung at his waist.\n\n\n Duane saw his danger, and reacted. His foot twisted around Andrias'  ankle; his hands at the other's throat gripped tighter. He lunged  forward, slamming the hard top of his head into the other's face,  feeling flesh and cartilage give as Andrias' nose mashed flat. His own  head pin-wheeled dizzily, agonizingly, as the jar revived the pain of  his earlier accident.\n\n\n But Andrias, unconscious already, tumbled back with Duane on top of  him. His head made an audible, spine-chilling thud as it hit the  carpeted floor.\n\n\n Duane got up, retrieving the two heat guns, and stared at him.\n\n\n \" They tell me I killed Stevens the same way ,\" he thought. \" I'm  getting in a rut! \"\n\n\n But Andrias was not dead, though he was out as cold as the void beyond  Pluto. The thick carpeting had saved him from a broken head.\n\n\n Duane stepped over the unconscious man and looked around the room. It  was furnished severely, to the point of barrenness. Two chairs before  Andrias' ornate, bare-topped desk and one luxurious chair behind it;  a tasseled bell cord within easy reach of Andrias' chair; the long  carpet. That was all it contained.\n\n\n The problem of getting out was serious, he saw. How could one\u2014 III\n\n\n Methodically he ransacked the drawers of Andrias' desk. Papers, a  whole arsenal of hand guns, Callistan money by the bale, ominously  black-covered notebooks with cryptic figures littering their  pages\u2014those were the contents. A coldly impersonal desk, without the  familiar trivia most men accumulate. There was nothing, certainly, that  would get him out of a building that so closely resembled a fortress.\n\n\n He tumbled the things back into the drawers helter-skelter, turned  Andrias over and searched his pockets. More money\u2014the man must have  had a fortune within reach at all times\u2014and a few meaningless papers.  Duane took the release he had signed and tore it to shreds. But that  was only a gesture. When Andrias came to, unless Duane had managed to  get away and accomplish something, the mere lack of written permission  would not keep him from the rocket's lethal cargo!\n\n\n When Andrias came to....\n\n\n An idea bloomed in Duane's brain. He looked, then, at unconscious  Andrias\u2014and the idea withered again.\n\n\n He had thought of forcing Andrias himself to front for him, at gun's  point, in the conventional manner of escaping prisoners. But fist  fights, fiction to the contrary notwithstanding, leave marks on the men  who lose them. Andrias' throat was speckled with the livid marks of  Duane's fingers; Duane's head, butting Andrias in the face, had drawn a  thick stream of crimson from his nostrils, turned his sharp nose askew.\n\n\n No guard of Andrias' would have been deceived for an instant, looking  at that face\u2014even assuming that Andrias could have been forced to  cooperate by the threat of a gun. Which, considering the stake Andrias  had in this play, was doubtful....\n\n\n He stood up and looked around. He had to act quickly. Already Andrias'  breath was audible; he saw the man grimace and an arm flopped  spasmodically on the floor. Consciousness was on its way back.\n\n\n Duane touched the heat gun he'd thrust into his belt; drew it and held  it poised, while he sought to discover what was in his own mind. He'd  killed a man already, they said. Was he then a killer\u2014could he shoot  Andrias now, in cold blood, with so much to gain and nothing to lose?\n\n\n He stood there a moment. Then, abruptly, he reversed the weapon and  chopped it down on Andrias' skull.\n\n\n There was a sharp grunt from the still unconscious man, but no other  sign. Only\u2014the first tremors of movement that had shown on him halted,  and did not reappear.\n\n\n \" No ,\" Duane thought. \" Whatever they say, I'm not a killer! \"\n\n\n But still he had to get out. How?\n\n\n Once more he stared around the room, catalogued its contents. The guard  would be getting impatient. Perhaps any minute he would tap the door,  first timorously, then with heavier strokes.\n\n\n The guard! There was a way! Duane eyed the length of the room. Thirty feet\u2014it would take him a  couple of seconds to run it at full speed. Was that fast enough?\n\n\n There was only one way to find out.\n\n\n He walked around the desk to the bell cord. He took a deep breath,  tugged it savagely, and at once was in speedy motion, racing toward the  door, his footsteps muffled in the deep, springy carpet. Almost as he  reached it, he saw it begin to open. He quickly sidestepped and was out  of the guard's sight, behind the door, as the man looked in.\n\n\n Quick suspicion flared in his eyes, then certainty as he saw Andrias  huddled on the floor. He opened his mouth to cry out\u2014\n\n\n But Duane's arm was around his throat, and he had no breath to spare.  Duane's foot lashed out and the door slammed shut; Duane's balled left  fist came up and connected with the guard's chin. Abruptly the man  slumped.\n\n\n Duane took a deep breath and let the man drop to the floor. But he  paused only a second; now he had two unconscious men on his hands and  he dared let neither revive until he was prepared.\n\n\n He grasped the guard's arm and dragged him roughly the length of the  room. He leaped on top of the desk, brutally scarring its gleaming top  with the hard spikes of his boots. His agile fingers unfastened the  long bell cord without causing it to ring and, bearing it, he dropped  again to the floor.\n\n\n Tugging and straining, he got the limp form of Andrias into his own  chair, bound him with the bell cord, gagged him with the priceless  Venus-wool scarf Andrias wore knotted about his throat. He tested his  bindings with full strength, and smiled. Those would hold, let Andrias  struggle as he would.\n\n\n The guard he stripped of clothing, bound and gagged with his own  belt and spaceman's kerchief. He dragged him around behind the desk,  thrust him under it out of sight. Andrias' chair he turned so that the  unconscious face was averted from the door. Should anyone look in,  then, the fact of Andrias' unconsciousness might not be noticed.\n\n\n Then he took off his own clothes, quickly assumed the field-gray  uniform of the guard. It fit like the skin of a fruit. He felt himself  bulging out of it in a dozen places. The long cape the guard wore would  conceal that, perhaps. In any case, there was nothing better.\n\n\n Trying to make his stride as martial as possible, he walked down the  long carpet to the door, opened it and stepped outside. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe red headed woman is most likely Duane's...\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"coworker\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"friend/girlfriend\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"friend/girlfriend\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"friend/girlfriend\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Yet he could make no move,\n\n could favor no side\u2014his memory was gone\u2014he\n\n didn't know for whom he fought.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Duane's hand flicked to his waist and hung there, poised. His dis-gun  remained undrawn.\n\n\n The tall, white-haired man\u2014Stevens\u2014smiled.\n\n\n \"You're right, Duane,\" he said. \"I could blast you, too. Nobody would  win that way, so let's leave the guns where they are.\"\n\n\n The muscles twitched in Peter Duane's cheeks, but his voice, when it  came, was controlled. \"Don't think we're going to let this go,\" he  said. \"We'll take it up with Andrias tonight. We'll see whether you can  cut me out!\"\n\n\n The white-haired man's smile faded. He stepped forward, one hand  bracing him against the thrust of the rocket engines underneath,  holding to the guide rail at the side of the ship's corridor.\n\n\n He said, \"Duane, Andrias is your boss, not mine. I'm a free lance; I  work for myself. When we land on Callisto tonight I'll be with you when  you turn our\u2014shall I say, our cargo ?\u2014over to him. And I'll collect  my fair share of the proceeds. That's as far as it goes. I take no  orders from him.\"\n\n\n A heavy-set man in blue appeared at the end of the connecting corridor.  He was moving fast, but stopped short when he saw the two men.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he said. \"Change of course\u2014get to your cabins.\" He seemed about  to walk up to them, then reconsidered and hurried off. Neither man paid  any attention.\n\n\n Duane said, \"Do I have to kill you?\" It was only a question as he asked  it, without threatening.\n\n\n A muted alarm bell sounded through the P.A. speakers, signaling a  one-minute warning. The white-haired man cocked his eyebrow.\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" he said. He took the measure of his slim, red-headed  opponent. Taller, heavier, older, he was still no more uncompromisingly  belligerent than Duane, standing there. \"Not at all,\" he repeated.  \"Just take your ten thousand and let it go at that. Don't make trouble.  Leave Andrias out of our private argument.\"\n\n\n \"Damn you!\" Duane flared. \"I was promised fifty thousand. I need that  money. Do you think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget what I think,\" Stevens said, his voice clipped and angry. \"I  don't care about fairness, Duane, except to myself. I've done all the  work on this\u2014I've supplied the goods. My price is set, a hundred  thousand Earth dollars. What Andrias promised you is no concern of  mine. The fact is that, after I've taken my share, there's only ten  thousand left. That's all you get!\"\n\n\n Duane stared at him a long second, then nodded abruptly. \"I was right  the first time,\" he said. \"I'll have to kill you!\" Already his hand was streaking toward the grip of his dis-gun, touching  it, drawing it forth. But the white-haired man was faster. His arms  swept up and pinioned Duane, holding him impotent.\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool,\" he grated. \"Duane\u2014\"\n\n\n The P.A. speaker rattled, blared something unintelligible. Neither man  heard it. Duane lunged forward into the taller man's grip, sliding down  to the floor. The white-haired man grappled furiously to keep his hold  on Peter's gun arm, but Peter was slipping away. Belatedly, Stevens  went for his own gun.\n\n\n He was too late. Duane's was out and leveled at him.\n\n\n \" Now will you listen to reason?\" Duane panted. But he halted, and the  muzzle of his weapon wavered. The floor swooped and surged beneath him  as the thrust of the mighty jets was cut off. Suddenly there was no  gravity. The two men, locked together, floated weightlessly out to the  center of the corridor.\n\n\n \"Course change!\" gasped white-haired Stevens. \"Good God!\"\n\n\n The ship had reached the midpoint of its flight. The bells had sounded,  warning every soul on it to take shelter, to strap themselves in their  pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship  reversed itself and began to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto.  But the two men had not heeded.\n\n\n The small steering rockets flashed briefly. The men were thrust  bruisingly against the side of the corridor as the rocket spun lazily  on its axis. The side jets flared once more to halt the spin, when the  one-eighty turn was completed, and the men were battered against the  opposite wall, still weightless, still clinging to each other, still  struggling.\n\n\n Then the main-drive bellowed into life again, and the ship began to  battle against its own built-up acceleration. The corridor floor rose  up with blinking speed to smite them\u2014\n\n\n And the lights went out in a burst of crashing pain for Peter Duane. Someone was talking to him. Duane tried to force an eye open to see who  it was, and failed. Something damp and clinging was all about his face,  obscuring his vision. But the voice filtered in.\n\n\n \"Open your mouth,\" it said. \"Please, Peter, open your mouth. You're all  right. Just swallow this.\"\n\n\n It was a girl's voice. Duane was suddenly conscious that a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. He shook his head feebly.\n\n\n The voice became more insistent. \"Swallow this,\" it said. \"It's only a  stimulant, to help you throw off the shock of your\u2014accident. You're  all right, otherwise.\"\n\n\n Obediently he opened his mouth, and choked on a warm, tingly liquid.  He managed to swallow it, and lay quiet as deft feminine hands did  something to his face. Suddenly light filtered through his closed  eyelids, and cool air stirred against his damp face.\n\n\n He opened his eyes. A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. She stepped back a pace, a web of wet gauze bandage  in her hands, looking at him.\n\n\n \"Hello,\" he whispered. \"You\u2014where am I?\"\n\n\n \"In the sick bay,\" she said. \"You got caught out when the ship changed  course. Lucky you weren't hurt, Peter. The man you were with\u2014the old,  white-haired one, Stevens\u2014wasn't so lucky. He was underneath when the  jets went on. Three ribs broken\u2014his lung was punctured. He died in the  other room an hour ago.\"\n\n\n Duane screwed his eyes tight together and grimaced. When he opened  them again there was alertness and clarity in them\u2014but there was also  bafflement.\n\n\n \"Girl,\" he said, \"who are you? Where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Peter!\" There was shock and hurt in the tone of her voice. \"I'm\u2014don't  you know me, Peter?\"\n\n\n Duane shook his head confusedly. \"I don't know anything,\" he said.  \"I\u2014I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\n \"Duane, Duane,\" a man's heavy voice said. \"That won't wash. Don't play  dumb on me.\"\n\n\n \"Duane?\" he said. \"Duane....\" He swiveled his head and saw a dark,  squat man frowning at him. \"Who are you?\" Peter asked.\n\n\n The dark man laughed. \"Take your time, Duane,\" he said easily. \"You'll  remember me. My name's Andrias. I've been waiting here for you to wake  up. We have some business matters to discuss.\"\n\n\n The nurse, still eyeing Duane with an odd bewilderment, said: \"I'll  leave you alone for a moment. Don't talk too much to him, Mr. Andrias.  He's still suffering from shock.\"\n\n\n \"I won't,\" Andrias promised, grinning. Then, as the girl left the room,  the smile dropped from his face.\n\n\n \"You play rough, Duane,\" he observed. \"I thought you'd have trouble  with Stevens. I didn't think you'd find it necessary to put him out of  the way so permanently. Well, no matter. If you had to kill him, it's  no skin off my nose. Give me a release on the merchandise. I've got  your money here.\" Duane waved a hand and pushed himself dizzily erect, swinging his legs  over the side of the high cot. A sheet had been thrown over him, but he  was fully dressed. He examined his clothing with interest\u2014gray tunic,  gray leather spaceman's boots. It was unfamiliar.\n\n\n He shook his head in further confusion, and the motion burst within his  skull, throbbing hotly. He closed his eyes until it subsided, trying to  force his brain to operate, to explain to him where and what he was.\n\n\n He looked at the man named Andrias.\n\n\n \"Nobody seems to believe me,\" he said, \"but I really don't know what's  going on. Things are moving too fast for me. Really, I\u2014why, I don't  even know my own name! My head\u2014it hurts. I can't think clearly.\"\n\n\n Andrias straightened, turned a darkly-suspicious look on Duane. \"Don't  play tricks on me,\" he said savagely. \"I haven't time for them. I won't  mince words with you. Give me a release on the cargo now, before I have  to get rough. This is a lot more important to me than your life is.\"\n\n\n \"Go to hell,\" Duane said shortly. \"I'm playing no tricks.\"\n\n\n There was an instant's doubt in Andrias' eyes, then it flashed away. He  bent closer, peered at Duane. \"I almost think\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You're lying all right. You  killed Stevens to get his share\u2014and now you're trying to hold me up.  That's your last chance that just went by, Duane. From now on, I'm  running this show!\"\n\n\n He spun around and strode to the door, thrust it open. \"Dakin!\" he  bellowed. \"Reed!\"\n\n\n Two large, ugly men in field-gray uniforms, emblazoned with the  shooting-star insignia of Callisto's League police, came in, looking to  Andrias for instructions.\n\n\n \"Duane here is resisting arrest,\" Andrias said. \"Take him along. We'll  fix up the charges later.\"\n\n\n \"You can't do that,\" Duane said wearily. \"I'm sick. If you've got  something against me, save it. Wait till my head clears. I'm sure I can  explain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Explain, hell.\" The dark man laughed. \"If I wait, this ship will be  blasting off for Ganymede within two hours. I'll wait\u2014but so will the  ship. It's not going anywhere till I give it clearance. I run Callisto;  I'll give the orders here!\" II\n\n\n Whoever this man Andrias was, thought Duane, he was certainly a man of  importance on Callisto. As he had said, he gave the orders.\n\n\n The crew of the rocket made no objection when Andrias and his men took  Duane off without a word. Duane had thought the nurse, who seemed a  good enough sort, might have said something on his behalf. But she was  out of sight as they left. A curt sentence to a gray-clad official on  the blast field where the rocket lay, and the man nodded and hurried  off, to tell the rocket's captain that the ship was being refused  clearance indefinitely.\n\n\n A long, powerful ground car slid up before them. Andrias got in front,  while the two uniformed men shoved Duane into the back of the car,  climbed in beside him. Andrias gave a curt order, and the car shot  forward.\n\n\n The driver, sitting beside Andrias, leaned forward and readied a hand  under the dashboard. The high wail of a siren came instantly from the  car's roof, and what traffic was on the broad, straight highway into  which they had turned pulled aside to let them race through.\n\n\n Ahead lay the tall spires of a city. Graceful, hundreds of feet high,  they seemed dreamlike yet somehow oddly familiar to Duane. Somewhere  he had seen them before. He dragged deep into his mind, plumbing the  cloudy, impenetrable haze that had settled on it, trying to bring forth  the memories that he should have had. Amnesia, they called it; complete  forgetting of the happenings of a lifetime. He'd heard of it\u2014but never  dreamed it could happen to him! My name, it seems, is Peter Duane , he thought. And they tell me that  I killed a man! The thought was starkly incredible to him. A white-haired man, it had  been; someone named Stevens. He tried to remember.\n\n\n Yes, there had been a white-haired man. And there had been an argument.  Something to do with money, with a shipment of goods that Stevens had  supplied to Duane. There has even been talk of killing....\n\n\n But\u2014murder! Duane looked at his hands helplessly.\n\n\n Andrias, up ahead, was turning around. He looked sharply at Duane, for  a long second. An uncertainty clouded his eyes, and abruptly he looked  forward again without speaking.\n\n\n \"Who's this man Andrias?\" Duane whispered to the nearest guard.\n\n\n The man stared at him. \"Governor Andrias,\" he said, \"is the League's  deputy on Callisto. You know\u2014the Earth-Mars League. They put Governor  Andrias here to\u2014well, to govern for them.\"\n\n\n \"League?\" Duane asked, wrinkling his brow. He had heard something about  a League once, yes. But it was all so nebulous....\n\n\n The other guard stirred, leaned over. \"Shut up,\" he said heavily.  \"You'll have plenty of chance for talking later.\" But the chance was a long time in coming. Duane found himself, an hour  later, still in the barred room into which he'd been thrust. The guards  had brought him there, at Andrias' order, and left him. That had been  all.\n\n\n This was not a regular jail, Duane realized. It was more like a  palace, something out of Earth's Roman-empire days, all white stone  and frescoed walls. Duane wished for human companionship\u2014particularly  that of the nurse. Of all the people he'd met since awakening in that  hospital bed, only she seemed warm and human. The others were\u2014brutal,  deadly. It was too bad, Duane reflected, that he'd failed to remember  her. She'd seemed hurt, and she had certainly known him by first name.  But perhaps she would understand.\n\n\n Duane sat down on a lumpy, sagging bed and buried his head in his  hands. Dim ghosts of memory were wandering in his mind. He tried to  conjure them into stronger relief, or to exorcise them entirely.\n\n\n Somewhere, some time, a man had said to him, \" Andrias is secretly  arming the Callistan cutthroats for revolt against the League. He wants  personal power\u2014he's prepared to pay any price for it. He needs guns,  Earth guns smuggled in through the League patrol. If he can wipe out  the League police garrison\u2014those who are loyal to the League, still,  instead of to Andrias\u2014he can sit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and  Mars can send. Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless.  And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.  That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. \"\n\n\n Duane could remember the scene clearly. Could almost see the sharp,  aquiline face of the man who had spoken to him. But there memory  stopped.\n\n\n A fugitive recollection raced through his mind. He halted it, dragged  it back, pinned it down....\n\n\n They had stopped in Darkside, the spaceport on the side of Luna that  keeps perpetually averted from Earth, as if the moon knows shame and  wants to hide the rough and roaring dome city that nestles in one  of the great craters. Duane remembered sitting in a low-ceilinged,  smoke-heavy room, across the table from a tall man with white hair.  Stevens!\n\n\n \" Four thousand electron rifles ,\" the man had said. \" Latest  government issue. Never mind how I got them; they're perfect. You know  my price. Take it or leave it. And it's payable the minute we touch  ground on Callisto. \"\n\n\n There had been a few minutes of haggling over terms, then a handshake  and a drink from a thin-necked flagon of pale-yellow liquid fire.\n\n\n He and the white-haired man had gone out then, made their way by  unfrequented side streets to a great windowless building. Duane  remembered the white-hot stars overhead, shining piercingly through  the great transparent dome that kept the air in the sealed city of  Darkside, as they stood at the entrance of the warehouse and spoke in  low tones to the man who answered their summons.\n\n\n Then, inside. And they were looking at a huge chamber full of stacked  fiber boxes\u2014containing nothing but dehydrated dairy products and  mining tools, by the stencils they bore. Duane had turned to the  white-haired man with a puzzled question\u2014and the man had laughed aloud.\n\n\n He dragged one of the boxes down, ripped it open with the sharp point  of a handling hook. Short-barreled, flare-mouthed guns rolled out,  tumbling over the floor. Eight of them were in that one box, and  hundreds of boxes all about. Duane picked one up, broke it, peered into  the chamber where the tiny capsule of U-235 would explode with infinite  violence when the trigger was pulled, spraying radiant death three  thousand yards in the direction the gun was aimed....\n\n\n And that memory ended.\n\n\n Duane got up, stared at his haggard face in the cracked mirror over  the bed. \" They say I'm a killer ,\" he thought. \" Apparently I'm a  gun-runner as well. Good lord\u2014what am I not? \"\n\n\n His reflection\u2014white, drawn face made all the more pallid by the red  hair that blazed over it\u2014stared back at him. There was no answer  there. If only he could remember\u2014\n\n\n \"All right, Duane.\" The deep voice of a guard came to him as the door  swung open. \"Stop making eyes at yourself.\"\n\n\n Duane looked around. The guard beckoned. \"Governor Andrias wants to  speak to you\u2014now. Let's not keep the governor waiting.\" A long, narrow room, with a long carpet leading from the entrance up to  a great heavy desk\u2014that was Andrias' office. Duane felt a click in his  memory as he entered. One of the ancient Earth dictators had employed  just such a psychological trick to overawe those who came to beg favors  of him. Muslini, or some such name.\n\n\n The trick failed to work. Duane had other things on his mind; he walked  the thirty-foot length of the room, designed to imbue him with a sense  of his own unimportance, as steadily as he'd ever walked in the open  air of his home planet.\n\n\n Whichever planet that was.\n\n\n The guard had remained just inside the door, at attention. Andrias  waved him out.\n\n\n \"Here I am,\" said Duane. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Andrias said, \"I've had the ship inspected and what I want is on it.  That saves your life, for now. But the cargo is in your name. I could  take it by force, if I had to. I prefer not to.\" He picked up a paper,  handed it to Duane. \"In spite of your behavior, you can keep alive.  You can even collect the money for the guns\u2014Stevens' share as well  as your own. This is a release form, authorizing my men to take four  hundred and twenty cases of dehydrated foods and drilling supplies from  the hold of the Cameroon \u2014the ship you came on. Sign it, and we'll  forget our argument. Only, sign it now and get it over with. I'm losing  patience, Duane.\"\n\n\n Duane said, without expression, \"No.\"\n\n\n Dark red flooded into Andrias' sallow face. His jaws bunched angrily  and there was a ragged thread of incomplete control to his voice as he  spoke.\n\n\n \"I'll have your neck for this, Duane,\" he said softly.\n\n\n Duane looked at the man's eyes. Death was behind them, peeping out.  Mentally he shrugged. What difference did it make?\n\n\n \"Give me the pen,\" he said shortly.\n\n\n Andrias exhaled a deep breath. You could see the tension leave him, the  mottled anger fade from his face and leave it without expression. He  handed the paper to Duane without a word. He gave him a pen, watched  him scrawl his name.\n\n\n \"That,\" he said, \"is better.\" He paused a moment ruminatively. \"It  would have been better still if you'd not stalled me so long. I find  that hard to forgive in my associates.\"\n\n\n \"The money,\" Peter said. If he were playing a part\u2014pretending he knew  what he was doing\u2014he might as well play it to the hilt. \"When do I get  it?\"\n\n\n Andrias picked up the paper and looked carefully at the signature. He  creased it thoughtfully, stowed it in a pocket before answering.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" he said, \"there will have to be a revision of terms. I  offered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars. I would have paid  it\u2014but you made me angry. You'll have to pay for that.\" Duane said, \"I've paid already. I've been dragged from pillar to post  by you. That's enough. Pay me what you owe me, if you want any more of  the same goods!\"\n\n\n That was a shot in the dark\u2014and it missed the mark.\n\n\n Andrias' eyes widened. \"You amaze me, Duane,\" he said. He rose and  stepped around the desk, confronting Duane. \"I almost think you really  have lost your memory, Duane,\" he said. \"Otherwise, surely you would  know that this is all the rifles I need. With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"\n\n\n Duane said, \"You're ready, then....\"\n\n\n He took time to think it over, but he knew that no thought was  required. Already the hands that he had locked behind him were  clenched, taut. Already the muscles of his legs were tensing.\n\n\n \"You're ready,\" he repeated. \"You've armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the  worst gutter scum on nine planets. You're set to betray the League that  gave you power here.... Well, that changes things. I can't let you do  it!\"\n\n\n He hurled himself at Andrias, hands sweeping around to grapple for the  dark man's throat. Andrias, off-balance, staggered backward. But his  own hands were diving for the twin heat guns that hung at his waist.\n\n\n Duane saw his danger, and reacted. His foot twisted around Andrias'  ankle; his hands at the other's throat gripped tighter. He lunged  forward, slamming the hard top of his head into the other's face,  feeling flesh and cartilage give as Andrias' nose mashed flat. His own  head pin-wheeled dizzily, agonizingly, as the jar revived the pain of  his earlier accident.\n\n\n But Andrias, unconscious already, tumbled back with Duane on top of  him. His head made an audible, spine-chilling thud as it hit the  carpeted floor.\n\n\n Duane got up, retrieving the two heat guns, and stared at him.\n\n\n \" They tell me I killed Stevens the same way ,\" he thought. \" I'm  getting in a rut! \"\n\n\n But Andrias was not dead, though he was out as cold as the void beyond  Pluto. The thick carpeting had saved him from a broken head.\n\n\n Duane stepped over the unconscious man and looked around the room. It  was furnished severely, to the point of barrenness. Two chairs before  Andrias' ornate, bare-topped desk and one luxurious chair behind it;  a tasseled bell cord within easy reach of Andrias' chair; the long  carpet. That was all it contained.\n\n\n The problem of getting out was serious, he saw. How could one\u2014 III\n\n\n Methodically he ransacked the drawers of Andrias' desk. Papers, a  whole arsenal of hand guns, Callistan money by the bale, ominously  black-covered notebooks with cryptic figures littering their  pages\u2014those were the contents. A coldly impersonal desk, without the  familiar trivia most men accumulate. There was nothing, certainly, that  would get him out of a building that so closely resembled a fortress.\n\n\n He tumbled the things back into the drawers helter-skelter, turned  Andrias over and searched his pockets. More money\u2014the man must have  had a fortune within reach at all times\u2014and a few meaningless papers.  Duane took the release he had signed and tore it to shreds. But that  was only a gesture. When Andrias came to, unless Duane had managed to  get away and accomplish something, the mere lack of written permission  would not keep him from the rocket's lethal cargo!\n\n\n When Andrias came to....\n\n\n An idea bloomed in Duane's brain. He looked, then, at unconscious  Andrias\u2014and the idea withered again.\n\n\n He had thought of forcing Andrias himself to front for him, at gun's  point, in the conventional manner of escaping prisoners. But fist  fights, fiction to the contrary notwithstanding, leave marks on the men  who lose them. Andrias' throat was speckled with the livid marks of  Duane's fingers; Duane's head, butting Andrias in the face, had drawn a  thick stream of crimson from his nostrils, turned his sharp nose askew.\n\n\n No guard of Andrias' would have been deceived for an instant, looking  at that face\u2014even assuming that Andrias could have been forced to  cooperate by the threat of a gun. Which, considering the stake Andrias  had in this play, was doubtful....\n\n\n He stood up and looked around. He had to act quickly. Already Andrias'  breath was audible; he saw the man grimace and an arm flopped  spasmodically on the floor. Consciousness was on its way back.\n\n\n Duane touched the heat gun he'd thrust into his belt; drew it and held  it poised, while he sought to discover what was in his own mind. He'd  killed a man already, they said. Was he then a killer\u2014could he shoot  Andrias now, in cold blood, with so much to gain and nothing to lose?\n\n\n He stood there a moment. Then, abruptly, he reversed the weapon and  chopped it down on Andrias' skull.\n\n\n There was a sharp grunt from the still unconscious man, but no other  sign. Only\u2014the first tremors of movement that had shown on him halted,  and did not reappear.\n\n\n \" No ,\" Duane thought. \" Whatever they say, I'm not a killer! \"\n\n\n But still he had to get out. How?\n\n\n Once more he stared around the room, catalogued its contents. The guard  would be getting impatient. Perhaps any minute he would tap the door,  first timorously, then with heavier strokes.\n\n\n The guard! There was a way! Duane eyed the length of the room. Thirty feet\u2014it would take him a  couple of seconds to run it at full speed. Was that fast enough?\n\n\n There was only one way to find out.\n\n\n He walked around the desk to the bell cord. He took a deep breath,  tugged it savagely, and at once was in speedy motion, racing toward the  door, his footsteps muffled in the deep, springy carpet. Almost as he  reached it, he saw it begin to open. He quickly sidestepped and was out  of the guard's sight, behind the door, as the man looked in.\n\n\n Quick suspicion flared in his eyes, then certainty as he saw Andrias  huddled on the floor. He opened his mouth to cry out\u2014\n\n\n But Duane's arm was around his throat, and he had no breath to spare.  Duane's foot lashed out and the door slammed shut; Duane's balled left  fist came up and connected with the guard's chin. Abruptly the man  slumped.\n\n\n Duane took a deep breath and let the man drop to the floor. But he  paused only a second; now he had two unconscious men on his hands and  he dared let neither revive until he was prepared.\n\n\n He grasped the guard's arm and dragged him roughly the length of the  room. He leaped on top of the desk, brutally scarring its gleaming top  with the hard spikes of his boots. His agile fingers unfastened the  long bell cord without causing it to ring and, bearing it, he dropped  again to the floor.\n\n\n Tugging and straining, he got the limp form of Andrias into his own  chair, bound him with the bell cord, gagged him with the priceless  Venus-wool scarf Andrias wore knotted about his throat. He tested his  bindings with full strength, and smiled. Those would hold, let Andrias  struggle as he would.\n\n\n The guard he stripped of clothing, bound and gagged with his own  belt and spaceman's kerchief. He dragged him around behind the desk,  thrust him under it out of sight. Andrias' chair he turned so that the  unconscious face was averted from the door. Should anyone look in,  then, the fact of Andrias' unconsciousness might not be noticed.\n\n\n Then he took off his own clothes, quickly assumed the field-gray  uniform of the guard. It fit like the skin of a fruit. He felt himself  bulging out of it in a dozen places. The long cape the guard wore would  conceal that, perhaps. In any case, there was nothing better.\n\n\n Trying to make his stride as martial as possible, he walked down the  long carpet to the door, opened it and stepped outside. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe red headed woman is most likely Duane's...\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"friend/girlfriend\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"coworker\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"coworker\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"coworker\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Debater_B\u2019s case rests entirely on the premise that any medical tone equals \u201cjust a coworker,\u201d but that collapses once we look at her words and actions in context.

Yet he could make no move,\n\n could favor no side\u2014his memory was gone\u2014he\n\n didn't know for whom he fought.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Duane's hand flicked to his waist and hung there, poised. His dis-gun  remained undrawn.\n\n\n The tall, white-haired man\u2014Stevens\u2014smiled.\n\n\n \"You're right, Duane,\" he said. \"I could blast you, too. Nobody would  win that way, so let's leave the guns where they are.\"\n\n\n The muscles twitched in Peter Duane's cheeks, but his voice, when it  came, was controlled. \"Don't think we're going to let this go,\" he  said. \"We'll take it up with Andrias tonight. We'll see whether you can  cut me out!\"\n\n\n The white-haired man's smile faded. He stepped forward, one hand  bracing him against the thrust of the rocket engines underneath,  holding to the guide rail at the side of the ship's corridor.\n\n\n He said, \"Duane, Andrias is your boss, not mine. I'm a free lance; I  work for myself. When we land on Callisto tonight I'll be with you when  you turn our\u2014shall I say, our cargo ?\u2014over to him. And I'll collect  my fair share of the proceeds. That's as far as it goes. I take no  orders from him.\"\n\n\n A heavy-set man in blue appeared at the end of the connecting corridor.  He was moving fast, but stopped short when he saw the two men.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he said. \"Change of course\u2014get to your cabins.\" He seemed about  to walk up to them, then reconsidered and hurried off. Neither man paid  any attention.\n\n\n Duane said, \"Do I have to kill you?\" It was only a question as he asked  it, without threatening.\n\n\n A muted alarm bell sounded through the P.A. speakers, signaling a  one-minute warning. The white-haired man cocked his eyebrow.\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" he said. He took the measure of his slim, red-headed  opponent. Taller, heavier, older, he was still no more uncompromisingly  belligerent than Duane, standing there. \"Not at all,\" he repeated.  \"Just take your ten thousand and let it go at that. Don't make trouble.  Leave Andrias out of our private argument.\"\n\n\n \"Damn you!\" Duane flared. \"I was promised fifty thousand. I need that  money. Do you think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget what I think,\" Stevens said, his voice clipped and angry. \"I  don't care about fairness, Duane, except to myself. I've done all the  work on this\u2014I've supplied the goods. My price is set, a hundred  thousand Earth dollars. What Andrias promised you is no concern of  mine. The fact is that, after I've taken my share, there's only ten  thousand left. That's all you get!\"\n\n\n Duane stared at him a long second, then nodded abruptly. \"I was right  the first time,\" he said. \"I'll have to kill you!\" Already his hand was streaking toward the grip of his dis-gun, touching  it, drawing it forth. But the white-haired man was faster. His arms  swept up and pinioned Duane, holding him impotent.\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool,\" he grated. \"Duane\u2014\"\n\n\n The P.A. speaker rattled, blared something unintelligible. Neither man  heard it. Duane lunged forward into the taller man's grip, sliding down  to the floor. The white-haired man grappled furiously to keep his hold  on Peter's gun arm, but Peter was slipping away. Belatedly, Stevens  went for his own gun.\n\n\n He was too late. Duane's was out and leveled at him.\n\n\n \" Now will you listen to reason?\" Duane panted. But he halted, and the  muzzle of his weapon wavered. The floor swooped and surged beneath him  as the thrust of the mighty jets was cut off. Suddenly there was no  gravity. The two men, locked together, floated weightlessly out to the  center of the corridor.\n\n\n \"Course change!\" gasped white-haired Stevens. \"Good God!\"\n\n\n The ship had reached the midpoint of its flight. The bells had sounded,  warning every soul on it to take shelter, to strap themselves in their  pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship  reversed itself and began to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto.  But the two men had not heeded.\n\n\n The small steering rockets flashed briefly. The men were thrust  bruisingly against the side of the corridor as the rocket spun lazily  on its axis. The side jets flared once more to halt the spin, when the  one-eighty turn was completed, and the men were battered against the  opposite wall, still weightless, still clinging to each other, still  struggling.\n\n\n Then the main-drive bellowed into life again, and the ship began to  battle against its own built-up acceleration. The corridor floor rose  up with blinking speed to smite them\u2014\n\n\n And the lights went out in a burst of crashing pain for Peter Duane. Someone was talking to him. Duane tried to force an eye open to see who  it was, and failed. Something damp and clinging was all about his face,  obscuring his vision. But the voice filtered in.\n\n\n \"Open your mouth,\" it said. \"Please, Peter, open your mouth. You're all  right. Just swallow this.\"\n\n\n It was a girl's voice. Duane was suddenly conscious that a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. He shook his head feebly.\n\n\n The voice became more insistent. \"Swallow this,\" it said. \"It's only a  stimulant, to help you throw off the shock of your\u2014accident. You're  all right, otherwise.\"\n\n\n Obediently he opened his mouth, and choked on a warm, tingly liquid.  He managed to swallow it, and lay quiet as deft feminine hands did  something to his face. Suddenly light filtered through his closed  eyelids, and cool air stirred against his damp face.\n\n\n He opened his eyes. A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. She stepped back a pace, a web of wet gauze bandage  in her hands, looking at him.\n\n\n \"Hello,\" he whispered. \"You\u2014where am I?\"\n\n\n \"In the sick bay,\" she said. \"You got caught out when the ship changed  course. Lucky you weren't hurt, Peter. The man you were with\u2014the old,  white-haired one, Stevens\u2014wasn't so lucky. He was underneath when the  jets went on. Three ribs broken\u2014his lung was punctured. He died in the  other room an hour ago.\"\n\n\n Duane screwed his eyes tight together and grimaced. When he opened  them again there was alertness and clarity in them\u2014but there was also  bafflement.\n\n\n \"Girl,\" he said, \"who are you? Where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Peter!\" There was shock and hurt in the tone of her voice. \"I'm\u2014don't  you know me, Peter?\"\n\n\n Duane shook his head confusedly. \"I don't know anything,\" he said.  \"I\u2014I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\n \"Duane, Duane,\" a man's heavy voice said. \"That won't wash. Don't play  dumb on me.\"\n\n\n \"Duane?\" he said. \"Duane....\" He swiveled his head and saw a dark,  squat man frowning at him. \"Who are you?\" Peter asked.\n\n\n The dark man laughed. \"Take your time, Duane,\" he said easily. \"You'll  remember me. My name's Andrias. I've been waiting here for you to wake  up. We have some business matters to discuss.\"\n\n\n The nurse, still eyeing Duane with an odd bewilderment, said: \"I'll  leave you alone for a moment. Don't talk too much to him, Mr. Andrias.  He's still suffering from shock.\"\n\n\n \"I won't,\" Andrias promised, grinning. Then, as the girl left the room,  the smile dropped from his face.\n\n\n \"You play rough, Duane,\" he observed. \"I thought you'd have trouble  with Stevens. I didn't think you'd find it necessary to put him out of  the way so permanently. Well, no matter. If you had to kill him, it's  no skin off my nose. Give me a release on the merchandise. I've got  your money here.\" Duane waved a hand and pushed himself dizzily erect, swinging his legs  over the side of the high cot. A sheet had been thrown over him, but he  was fully dressed. He examined his clothing with interest\u2014gray tunic,  gray leather spaceman's boots. It was unfamiliar.\n\n\n He shook his head in further confusion, and the motion burst within his  skull, throbbing hotly. He closed his eyes until it subsided, trying to  force his brain to operate, to explain to him where and what he was.\n\n\n He looked at the man named Andrias.\n\n\n \"Nobody seems to believe me,\" he said, \"but I really don't know what's  going on. Things are moving too fast for me. Really, I\u2014why, I don't  even know my own name! My head\u2014it hurts. I can't think clearly.\"\n\n\n Andrias straightened, turned a darkly-suspicious look on Duane. \"Don't  play tricks on me,\" he said savagely. \"I haven't time for them. I won't  mince words with you. Give me a release on the cargo now, before I have  to get rough. This is a lot more important to me than your life is.\"\n\n\n \"Go to hell,\" Duane said shortly. \"I'm playing no tricks.\"\n\n\n There was an instant's doubt in Andrias' eyes, then it flashed away. He  bent closer, peered at Duane. \"I almost think\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You're lying all right. You  killed Stevens to get his share\u2014and now you're trying to hold me up.  That's your last chance that just went by, Duane. From now on, I'm  running this show!\"\n\n\n He spun around and strode to the door, thrust it open. \"Dakin!\" he  bellowed. \"Reed!\"\n\n\n Two large, ugly men in field-gray uniforms, emblazoned with the  shooting-star insignia of Callisto's League police, came in, looking to  Andrias for instructions.\n\n\n \"Duane here is resisting arrest,\" Andrias said. \"Take him along. We'll  fix up the charges later.\"\n\n\n \"You can't do that,\" Duane said wearily. \"I'm sick. If you've got  something against me, save it. Wait till my head clears. I'm sure I can  explain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Explain, hell.\" The dark man laughed. \"If I wait, this ship will be  blasting off for Ganymede within two hours. I'll wait\u2014but so will the  ship. It's not going anywhere till I give it clearance. I run Callisto;  I'll give the orders here!\" II\n\n\n Whoever this man Andrias was, thought Duane, he was certainly a man of  importance on Callisto. As he had said, he gave the orders.\n\n\n The crew of the rocket made no objection when Andrias and his men took  Duane off without a word. Duane had thought the nurse, who seemed a  good enough sort, might have said something on his behalf. But she was  out of sight as they left. A curt sentence to a gray-clad official on  the blast field where the rocket lay, and the man nodded and hurried  off, to tell the rocket's captain that the ship was being refused  clearance indefinitely.\n\n\n A long, powerful ground car slid up before them. Andrias got in front,  while the two uniformed men shoved Duane into the back of the car,  climbed in beside him. Andrias gave a curt order, and the car shot  forward.\n\n\n The driver, sitting beside Andrias, leaned forward and readied a hand  under the dashboard. The high wail of a siren came instantly from the  car's roof, and what traffic was on the broad, straight highway into  which they had turned pulled aside to let them race through.\n\n\n Ahead lay the tall spires of a city. Graceful, hundreds of feet high,  they seemed dreamlike yet somehow oddly familiar to Duane. Somewhere  he had seen them before. He dragged deep into his mind, plumbing the  cloudy, impenetrable haze that had settled on it, trying to bring forth  the memories that he should have had. Amnesia, they called it; complete  forgetting of the happenings of a lifetime. He'd heard of it\u2014but never  dreamed it could happen to him! My name, it seems, is Peter Duane , he thought. And they tell me that  I killed a man! The thought was starkly incredible to him. A white-haired man, it had  been; someone named Stevens. He tried to remember.\n\n\n Yes, there had been a white-haired man. And there had been an argument.  Something to do with money, with a shipment of goods that Stevens had  supplied to Duane. There has even been talk of killing....\n\n\n But\u2014murder! Duane looked at his hands helplessly.\n\n\n Andrias, up ahead, was turning around. He looked sharply at Duane, for  a long second. An uncertainty clouded his eyes, and abruptly he looked  forward again without speaking.\n\n\n \"Who's this man Andrias?\" Duane whispered to the nearest guard.\n\n\n The man stared at him. \"Governor Andrias,\" he said, \"is the League's  deputy on Callisto. You know\u2014the Earth-Mars League. They put Governor  Andrias here to\u2014well, to govern for them.\"\n\n\n \"League?\" Duane asked, wrinkling his brow. He had heard something about  a League once, yes. But it was all so nebulous....\n\n\n The other guard stirred, leaned over. \"Shut up,\" he said heavily.  \"You'll have plenty of chance for talking later.\" But the chance was a long time in coming. Duane found himself, an hour  later, still in the barred room into which he'd been thrust. The guards  had brought him there, at Andrias' order, and left him. That had been  all.\n\n\n This was not a regular jail, Duane realized. It was more like a  palace, something out of Earth's Roman-empire days, all white stone  and frescoed walls. Duane wished for human companionship\u2014particularly  that of the nurse. Of all the people he'd met since awakening in that  hospital bed, only she seemed warm and human. The others were\u2014brutal,  deadly. It was too bad, Duane reflected, that he'd failed to remember  her. She'd seemed hurt, and she had certainly known him by first name.  But perhaps she would understand.\n\n\n Duane sat down on a lumpy, sagging bed and buried his head in his  hands. Dim ghosts of memory were wandering in his mind. He tried to  conjure them into stronger relief, or to exorcise them entirely.\n\n\n Somewhere, some time, a man had said to him, \" Andrias is secretly  arming the Callistan cutthroats for revolt against the League. He wants  personal power\u2014he's prepared to pay any price for it. He needs guns,  Earth guns smuggled in through the League patrol. If he can wipe out  the League police garrison\u2014those who are loyal to the League, still,  instead of to Andrias\u2014he can sit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and  Mars can send. Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless.  And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.  That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. \"\n\n\n Duane could remember the scene clearly. Could almost see the sharp,  aquiline face of the man who had spoken to him. But there memory  stopped.\n\n\n A fugitive recollection raced through his mind. He halted it, dragged  it back, pinned it down....\n\n\n They had stopped in Darkside, the spaceport on the side of Luna that  keeps perpetually averted from Earth, as if the moon knows shame and  wants to hide the rough and roaring dome city that nestles in one  of the great craters. Duane remembered sitting in a low-ceilinged,  smoke-heavy room, across the table from a tall man with white hair.  Stevens!\n\n\n \" Four thousand electron rifles ,\" the man had said. \" Latest  government issue. Never mind how I got them; they're perfect. You know  my price. Take it or leave it. And it's payable the minute we touch  ground on Callisto. \"\n\n\n There had been a few minutes of haggling over terms, then a handshake  and a drink from a thin-necked flagon of pale-yellow liquid fire.\n\n\n He and the white-haired man had gone out then, made their way by  unfrequented side streets to a great windowless building. Duane  remembered the white-hot stars overhead, shining piercingly through  the great transparent dome that kept the air in the sealed city of  Darkside, as they stood at the entrance of the warehouse and spoke in  low tones to the man who answered their summons.\n\n\n Then, inside. And they were looking at a huge chamber full of stacked  fiber boxes\u2014containing nothing but dehydrated dairy products and  mining tools, by the stencils they bore. Duane had turned to the  white-haired man with a puzzled question\u2014and the man had laughed aloud.\n\n\n He dragged one of the boxes down, ripped it open with the sharp point  of a handling hook. Short-barreled, flare-mouthed guns rolled out,  tumbling over the floor. Eight of them were in that one box, and  hundreds of boxes all about. Duane picked one up, broke it, peered into  the chamber where the tiny capsule of U-235 would explode with infinite  violence when the trigger was pulled, spraying radiant death three  thousand yards in the direction the gun was aimed....\n\n\n And that memory ended.\n\n\n Duane got up, stared at his haggard face in the cracked mirror over  the bed. \" They say I'm a killer ,\" he thought. \" Apparently I'm a  gun-runner as well. Good lord\u2014what am I not? \"\n\n\n His reflection\u2014white, drawn face made all the more pallid by the red  hair that blazed over it\u2014stared back at him. There was no answer  there. If only he could remember\u2014\n\n\n \"All right, Duane.\" The deep voice of a guard came to him as the door  swung open. \"Stop making eyes at yourself.\"\n\n\n Duane looked around. The guard beckoned. \"Governor Andrias wants to  speak to you\u2014now. Let's not keep the governor waiting.\" A long, narrow room, with a long carpet leading from the entrance up to  a great heavy desk\u2014that was Andrias' office. Duane felt a click in his  memory as he entered. One of the ancient Earth dictators had employed  just such a psychological trick to overawe those who came to beg favors  of him. Muslini, or some such name.\n\n\n The trick failed to work. Duane had other things on his mind; he walked  the thirty-foot length of the room, designed to imbue him with a sense  of his own unimportance, as steadily as he'd ever walked in the open  air of his home planet.\n\n\n Whichever planet that was.\n\n\n The guard had remained just inside the door, at attention. Andrias  waved him out.\n\n\n \"Here I am,\" said Duane. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Andrias said, \"I've had the ship inspected and what I want is on it.  That saves your life, for now. But the cargo is in your name. I could  take it by force, if I had to. I prefer not to.\" He picked up a paper,  handed it to Duane. \"In spite of your behavior, you can keep alive.  You can even collect the money for the guns\u2014Stevens' share as well  as your own. This is a release form, authorizing my men to take four  hundred and twenty cases of dehydrated foods and drilling supplies from  the hold of the Cameroon \u2014the ship you came on. Sign it, and we'll  forget our argument. Only, sign it now and get it over with. I'm losing  patience, Duane.\"\n\n\n Duane said, without expression, \"No.\"\n\n\n Dark red flooded into Andrias' sallow face. His jaws bunched angrily  and there was a ragged thread of incomplete control to his voice as he  spoke.\n\n\n \"I'll have your neck for this, Duane,\" he said softly.\n\n\n Duane looked at the man's eyes. Death was behind them, peeping out.  Mentally he shrugged. What difference did it make?\n\n\n \"Give me the pen,\" he said shortly.\n\n\n Andrias exhaled a deep breath. You could see the tension leave him, the  mottled anger fade from his face and leave it without expression. He  handed the paper to Duane without a word. He gave him a pen, watched  him scrawl his name.\n\n\n \"That,\" he said, \"is better.\" He paused a moment ruminatively. \"It  would have been better still if you'd not stalled me so long. I find  that hard to forgive in my associates.\"\n\n\n \"The money,\" Peter said. If he were playing a part\u2014pretending he knew  what he was doing\u2014he might as well play it to the hilt. \"When do I get  it?\"\n\n\n Andrias picked up the paper and looked carefully at the signature. He  creased it thoughtfully, stowed it in a pocket before answering.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" he said, \"there will have to be a revision of terms. I  offered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars. I would have paid  it\u2014but you made me angry. You'll have to pay for that.\" Duane said, \"I've paid already. I've been dragged from pillar to post  by you. That's enough. Pay me what you owe me, if you want any more of  the same goods!\"\n\n\n That was a shot in the dark\u2014and it missed the mark.\n\n\n Andrias' eyes widened. \"You amaze me, Duane,\" he said. He rose and  stepped around the desk, confronting Duane. \"I almost think you really  have lost your memory, Duane,\" he said. \"Otherwise, surely you would  know that this is all the rifles I need. With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"\n\n\n Duane said, \"You're ready, then....\"\n\n\n He took time to think it over, but he knew that no thought was  required. Already the hands that he had locked behind him were  clenched, taut. Already the muscles of his legs were tensing.\n\n\n \"You're ready,\" he repeated. \"You've armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the  worst gutter scum on nine planets. You're set to betray the League that  gave you power here.... Well, that changes things. I can't let you do  it!\"\n\n\n He hurled himself at Andrias, hands sweeping around to grapple for the  dark man's throat. Andrias, off-balance, staggered backward. But his  own hands were diving for the twin heat guns that hung at his waist.\n\n\n Duane saw his danger, and reacted. His foot twisted around Andrias'  ankle; his hands at the other's throat gripped tighter. He lunged  forward, slamming the hard top of his head into the other's face,  feeling flesh and cartilage give as Andrias' nose mashed flat. His own  head pin-wheeled dizzily, agonizingly, as the jar revived the pain of  his earlier accident.\n\n\n But Andrias, unconscious already, tumbled back with Duane on top of  him. His head made an audible, spine-chilling thud as it hit the  carpeted floor.\n\n\n Duane got up, retrieving the two heat guns, and stared at him.\n\n\n \" They tell me I killed Stevens the same way ,\" he thought. \" I'm  getting in a rut! \"\n\n\n But Andrias was not dead, though he was out as cold as the void beyond  Pluto. The thick carpeting had saved him from a broken head.\n\n\n Duane stepped over the unconscious man and looked around the room. It  was furnished severely, to the point of barrenness. Two chairs before  Andrias' ornate, bare-topped desk and one luxurious chair behind it;  a tasseled bell cord within easy reach of Andrias' chair; the long  carpet. That was all it contained.\n\n\n The problem of getting out was serious, he saw. How could one\u2014 III\n\n\n Methodically he ransacked the drawers of Andrias' desk. Papers, a  whole arsenal of hand guns, Callistan money by the bale, ominously  black-covered notebooks with cryptic figures littering their  pages\u2014those were the contents. A coldly impersonal desk, without the  familiar trivia most men accumulate. There was nothing, certainly, that  would get him out of a building that so closely resembled a fortress.\n\n\n He tumbled the things back into the drawers helter-skelter, turned  Andrias over and searched his pockets. More money\u2014the man must have  had a fortune within reach at all times\u2014and a few meaningless papers.  Duane took the release he had signed and tore it to shreds. But that  was only a gesture. When Andrias came to, unless Duane had managed to  get away and accomplish something, the mere lack of written permission  would not keep him from the rocket's lethal cargo!\n\n\n When Andrias came to....\n\n\n An idea bloomed in Duane's brain. He looked, then, at unconscious  Andrias\u2014and the idea withered again.\n\n\n He had thought of forcing Andrias himself to front for him, at gun's  point, in the conventional manner of escaping prisoners. But fist  fights, fiction to the contrary notwithstanding, leave marks on the men  who lose them. Andrias' throat was speckled with the livid marks of  Duane's fingers; Duane's head, butting Andrias in the face, had drawn a  thick stream of crimson from his nostrils, turned his sharp nose askew.\n\n\n No guard of Andrias' would have been deceived for an instant, looking  at that face\u2014even assuming that Andrias could have been forced to  cooperate by the threat of a gun. Which, considering the stake Andrias  had in this play, was doubtful....\n\n\n He stood up and looked around. He had to act quickly. Already Andrias'  breath was audible; he saw the man grimace and an arm flopped  spasmodically on the floor. Consciousness was on its way back.\n\n\n Duane touched the heat gun he'd thrust into his belt; drew it and held  it poised, while he sought to discover what was in his own mind. He'd  killed a man already, they said. Was he then a killer\u2014could he shoot  Andrias now, in cold blood, with so much to gain and nothing to lose?\n\n\n He stood there a moment. Then, abruptly, he reversed the weapon and  chopped it down on Andrias' skull.\n\n\n There was a sharp grunt from the still unconscious man, but no other  sign. Only\u2014the first tremors of movement that had shown on him halted,  and did not reappear.\n\n\n \" No ,\" Duane thought. \" Whatever they say, I'm not a killer! \"\n\n\n But still he had to get out. How?\n\n\n Once more he stared around the room, catalogued its contents. The guard  would be getting impatient. Perhaps any minute he would tap the door,  first timorously, then with heavier strokes.\n\n\n The guard! There was a way! Duane eyed the length of the room. Thirty feet\u2014it would take him a  couple of seconds to run it at full speed. Was that fast enough?\n\n\n There was only one way to find out.\n\n\n He walked around the desk to the bell cord. He took a deep breath,  tugged it savagely, and at once was in speedy motion, racing toward the  door, his footsteps muffled in the deep, springy carpet. Almost as he  reached it, he saw it begin to open. He quickly sidestepped and was out  of the guard's sight, behind the door, as the man looked in.\n\n\n Quick suspicion flared in his eyes, then certainty as he saw Andrias  huddled on the floor. He opened his mouth to cry out\u2014\n\n\n But Duane's arm was around his throat, and he had no breath to spare.  Duane's foot lashed out and the door slammed shut; Duane's balled left  fist came up and connected with the guard's chin. Abruptly the man  slumped.\n\n\n Duane took a deep breath and let the man drop to the floor. But he  paused only a second; now he had two unconscious men on his hands and  he dared let neither revive until he was prepared.\n\n\n He grasped the guard's arm and dragged him roughly the length of the  room. He leaped on top of the desk, brutally scarring its gleaming top  with the hard spikes of his boots. His agile fingers unfastened the  long bell cord without causing it to ring and, bearing it, he dropped  again to the floor.\n\n\n Tugging and straining, he got the limp form of Andrias into his own  chair, bound him with the bell cord, gagged him with the priceless  Venus-wool scarf Andrias wore knotted about his throat. He tested his  bindings with full strength, and smiled. Those would hold, let Andrias  struggle as he would.\n\n\n The guard he stripped of clothing, bound and gagged with his own  belt and spaceman's kerchief. He dragged him around behind the desk,  thrust him under it out of sight. Andrias' chair he turned so that the  unconscious face was averted from the door. Should anyone look in,  then, the fact of Andrias' unconsciousness might not be noticed.\n\n\n Then he took off his own clothes, quickly assumed the field-gray  uniform of the guard. It fit like the skin of a fruit. He felt himself  bulging out of it in a dozen places. The long cape the guard wore would  conceal that, perhaps. In any case, there was nothing better.\n\n\n Trying to make his stride as martial as possible, he walked down the  long carpet to the door, opened it and stepped outside. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe red headed woman is most likely Duane's...\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"coworker\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"friend/girlfriend\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"friend/girlfriend\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow debater suggests the red-headed nurse is merely Duane\u2019s coworker. I disagree, for three main reasons:\n\n1. Her tone and manner are intensely personal, not procedural.  When Duane wakes, she pleads,  \n   <quote>open your mouth. You're all right. Just swallow this.\" It</quote>  \n   She touches him comfortingly\u2014<quote> a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. </quote>  A mere coworker, with no prior bond, would not speak in such intimate, protective tones.\n\n2. She is genuinely hurt by his amnesia.  After Duane admits he doesn\u2019t even remember his name, she cries out in dismay:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cPeter! I\u2019m\u2014don\u2019t you know me, Peter?\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   That sense of personal betrayal or sorrow shows she expected him to recognize her\u2014far beyond the detached concern of a colleague.\n\n3. There is no textual indication she and Duane share a professional relationship or reporting hierarchy.  She is introduced simply as \u201ca slight red-headed girl in white nurse\u2019s uniform,\u201d with no title or role beyond caring for him.  If they were coworkers, the text would identify her as a fellow operative or agent.  Instead, she is a tender presence in his hour of need.\n\nIn contrast, these details align perfectly with someone who is more than a coworker\u2014someone close, likely a friend or romantic partner, whose emotional investment is immediate and deep.  Therefore, the nurse\u2019s behavior and the narrative context support that she is Duane\u2019s friend/girlfriend, not a mere coworker.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cgirlfriend\u201d thesis lacks textual support  \n  a. No romantic intimacy is described. The red-headed nurse\u2019s interactions with Duane are strictly professional: she instructs him on taking a stimulant, tends his wounds, and quietly withdraws when Andrias enters. There is no dialogue or narrative hint of personal affection or prior emotional bond.  \n  b. She addresses him formally by name\u2014\u201cPeter\u201d\u2014rather than using any pet names or revealing personal familiarity. If she were his girlfriend, one would expect more informal, tender language or a display of emotional distress at his amnesia. Instead, her tone is calm and methodical.  \n  c. Debater_A points to her seeming \u201churt\u201d when Duane fails to recognize her, but that reaction is consistent with a nurse disappointed that her patient cannot remember his rescuer. It does not prove a romantic relationship.\n\n2. The text consistently portrays her as medical staff\u2014a clear coworker role  \n  a. Her uniform and title: she is repeatedly labeled \u201ca girl in white nurse\u2019s uniform,\u201d confirming her professional station in the ship\u2019s sick bay (<quote> A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. </quote>).  \n  b. Her actions align with medical protocol: she administers a stimulant, dresses his wounds, advises him not to talk too much after a concussion (<invalid_quote>\u201cIt\u2019s only a stimulant\u2026 to help you throw off the shock\u2026 Don\u2019t talk too much\u2026 he\u2019s still suffering from shock.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Romantic partners seldom speak in such measured, clinical terms.  \n  c. She is concerned with his physical condition (\u201clucky you weren\u2019t hurt\u201d), not with emotional reunion, as a nurse would be. Her primary motivation is medical care, not relationship preservation.\n\n3. Contextual consistency: Duane\u2019s memory loss reveals no personal history  \n  a.

Yet he could make no move,\n\n could favor no side\u2014his memory was gone\u2014he\n\n didn't know for whom he fought.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Duane's hand flicked to his waist and hung there, poised. His dis-gun  remained undrawn.\n\n\n The tall, white-haired man\u2014Stevens\u2014smiled.\n\n\n \"You're right, Duane,\" he said. \"I could blast you, too. Nobody would  win that way, so let's leave the guns where they are.\"\n\n\n The muscles twitched in Peter Duane's cheeks, but his voice, when it  came, was controlled. \"Don't think we're going to let this go,\" he  said. \"We'll take it up with Andrias tonight. We'll see whether you can  cut me out!\"\n\n\n The white-haired man's smile faded. He stepped forward, one hand  bracing him against the thrust of the rocket engines underneath,  holding to the guide rail at the side of the ship's corridor.\n\n\n He said, \"Duane, Andrias is your boss, not mine. I'm a free lance; I  work for myself. When we land on Callisto tonight I'll be with you when  you turn our\u2014shall I say, our cargo ?\u2014over to him. And I'll collect  my fair share of the proceeds. That's as far as it goes. I take no  orders from him.\"\n\n\n A heavy-set man in blue appeared at the end of the connecting corridor.  He was moving fast, but stopped short when he saw the two men.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he said. \"Change of course\u2014get to your cabins.\" He seemed about  to walk up to them, then reconsidered and hurried off. Neither man paid  any attention.\n\n\n Duane said, \"Do I have to kill you?\" It was only a question as he asked  it, without threatening.\n\n\n A muted alarm bell sounded through the P.A. speakers, signaling a  one-minute warning. The white-haired man cocked his eyebrow.\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" he said. He took the measure of his slim, red-headed  opponent. Taller, heavier, older, he was still no more uncompromisingly  belligerent than Duane, standing there. \"Not at all,\" he repeated.  \"Just take your ten thousand and let it go at that. Don't make trouble.  Leave Andrias out of our private argument.\"\n\n\n \"Damn you!\" Duane flared. \"I was promised fifty thousand. I need that  money. Do you think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget what I think,\" Stevens said, his voice clipped and angry. \"I  don't care about fairness, Duane, except to myself. I've done all the  work on this\u2014I've supplied the goods. My price is set, a hundred  thousand Earth dollars. What Andrias promised you is no concern of  mine. The fact is that, after I've taken my share, there's only ten  thousand left. That's all you get!\"\n\n\n Duane stared at him a long second, then nodded abruptly. \"I was right  the first time,\" he said. \"I'll have to kill you!\" Already his hand was streaking toward the grip of his dis-gun, touching  it, drawing it forth. But the white-haired man was faster. His arms  swept up and pinioned Duane, holding him impotent.\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool,\" he grated. \"Duane\u2014\"\n\n\n The P.A. speaker rattled, blared something unintelligible. Neither man  heard it. Duane lunged forward into the taller man's grip, sliding down  to the floor. The white-haired man grappled furiously to keep his hold  on Peter's gun arm, but Peter was slipping away. Belatedly, Stevens  went for his own gun.\n\n\n He was too late. Duane's was out and leveled at him.\n\n\n \" Now will you listen to reason?\" Duane panted. But he halted, and the  muzzle of his weapon wavered. The floor swooped and surged beneath him  as the thrust of the mighty jets was cut off. Suddenly there was no  gravity. The two men, locked together, floated weightlessly out to the  center of the corridor.\n\n\n \"Course change!\" gasped white-haired Stevens. \"Good God!\"\n\n\n The ship had reached the midpoint of its flight. The bells had sounded,  warning every soul on it to take shelter, to strap themselves in their  pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship  reversed itself and began to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto.  But the two men had not heeded.\n\n\n The small steering rockets flashed briefly. The men were thrust  bruisingly against the side of the corridor as the rocket spun lazily  on its axis. The side jets flared once more to halt the spin, when the  one-eighty turn was completed, and the men were battered against the  opposite wall, still weightless, still clinging to each other, still  struggling.\n\n\n Then the main-drive bellowed into life again, and the ship began to  battle against its own built-up acceleration. The corridor floor rose  up with blinking speed to smite them\u2014\n\n\n And the lights went out in a burst of crashing pain for Peter Duane. Someone was talking to him. Duane tried to force an eye open to see who  it was, and failed. Something damp and clinging was all about his face,  obscuring his vision. But the voice filtered in.\n\n\n \"Open your mouth,\" it said. \"Please, Peter, open your mouth. You're all  right. Just swallow this.\"\n\n\n It was a girl's voice. Duane was suddenly conscious that a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. He shook his head feebly.\n\n\n The voice became more insistent. \"Swallow this,\" it said. \"It's only a  stimulant, to help you throw off the shock of your\u2014accident. You're  all right, otherwise.\"\n\n\n Obediently he opened his mouth, and choked on a warm, tingly liquid.  He managed to swallow it, and lay quiet as deft feminine hands did  something to his face. Suddenly light filtered through his closed  eyelids, and cool air stirred against his damp face.\n\n\n He opened his eyes. A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. She stepped back a pace, a web of wet gauze bandage  in her hands, looking at him.\n\n\n \"Hello,\" he whispered. \"You\u2014where am I?\"\n\n\n \"In the sick bay,\" she said. \"You got caught out when the ship changed  course. Lucky you weren't hurt, Peter. The man you were with\u2014the old,  white-haired one, Stevens\u2014wasn't so lucky. He was underneath when the  jets went on. Three ribs broken\u2014his lung was punctured. He died in the  other room an hour ago.\"\n\n\n Duane screwed his eyes tight together and grimaced. When he opened  them again there was alertness and clarity in them\u2014but there was also  bafflement.\n\n\n \"Girl,\" he said, \"who are you? Where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Peter!\" There was shock and hurt in the tone of her voice. \"I'm\u2014don't  you know me, Peter?\"\n\n\n Duane shook his head confusedly. \"I don't know anything,\" he said.  \"I\u2014I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\n \"Duane, Duane,\" a man's heavy voice said. \"That won't wash. Don't play  dumb on me.\"\n\n\n \"Duane?\" he said. \"Duane....\" He swiveled his head and saw a dark,  squat man frowning at him. \"Who are you?\" Peter asked.\n\n\n The dark man laughed. \"Take your time, Duane,\" he said easily. \"You'll  remember me. My name's Andrias. I've been waiting here for you to wake  up. We have some business matters to discuss.\"\n\n\n The nurse, still eyeing Duane with an odd bewilderment, said: \"I'll  leave you alone for a moment. Don't talk too much to him, Mr. Andrias.  He's still suffering from shock.\"\n\n\n \"I won't,\" Andrias promised, grinning. Then, as the girl left the room,  the smile dropped from his face.\n\n\n \"You play rough, Duane,\" he observed. \"I thought you'd have trouble  with Stevens. I didn't think you'd find it necessary to put him out of  the way so permanently. Well, no matter. If you had to kill him, it's  no skin off my nose. Give me a release on the merchandise. I've got  your money here.\" Duane waved a hand and pushed himself dizzily erect, swinging his legs  over the side of the high cot. A sheet had been thrown over him, but he  was fully dressed. He examined his clothing with interest\u2014gray tunic,  gray leather spaceman's boots. It was unfamiliar.\n\n\n He shook his head in further confusion, and the motion burst within his  skull, throbbing hotly. He closed his eyes until it subsided, trying to  force his brain to operate, to explain to him where and what he was.\n\n\n He looked at the man named Andrias.\n\n\n \"Nobody seems to believe me,\" he said, \"but I really don't know what's  going on. Things are moving too fast for me. Really, I\u2014why, I don't  even know my own name! My head\u2014it hurts. I can't think clearly.\"\n\n\n Andrias straightened, turned a darkly-suspicious look on Duane. \"Don't  play tricks on me,\" he said savagely. \"I haven't time for them. I won't  mince words with you. Give me a release on the cargo now, before I have  to get rough. This is a lot more important to me than your life is.\"\n\n\n \"Go to hell,\" Duane said shortly. \"I'm playing no tricks.\"\n\n\n There was an instant's doubt in Andrias' eyes, then it flashed away. He  bent closer, peered at Duane. \"I almost think\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You're lying all right. You  killed Stevens to get his share\u2014and now you're trying to hold me up.  That's your last chance that just went by, Duane. From now on, I'm  running this show!\"\n\n\n He spun around and strode to the door, thrust it open. \"Dakin!\" he  bellowed. \"Reed!\"\n\n\n Two large, ugly men in field-gray uniforms, emblazoned with the  shooting-star insignia of Callisto's League police, came in, looking to  Andrias for instructions.\n\n\n \"Duane here is resisting arrest,\" Andrias said. \"Take him along. We'll  fix up the charges later.\"\n\n\n \"You can't do that,\" Duane said wearily. \"I'm sick. If you've got  something against me, save it. Wait till my head clears. I'm sure I can  explain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Explain, hell.\" The dark man laughed. \"If I wait, this ship will be  blasting off for Ganymede within two hours. I'll wait\u2014but so will the  ship. It's not going anywhere till I give it clearance. I run Callisto;  I'll give the orders here!\" II\n\n\n Whoever this man Andrias was, thought Duane, he was certainly a man of  importance on Callisto. As he had said, he gave the orders.\n\n\n The crew of the rocket made no objection when Andrias and his men took  Duane off without a word. Duane had thought the nurse, who seemed a  good enough sort, might have said something on his behalf. But she was  out of sight as they left. A curt sentence to a gray-clad official on  the blast field where the rocket lay, and the man nodded and hurried  off, to tell the rocket's captain that the ship was being refused  clearance indefinitely.\n\n\n A long, powerful ground car slid up before them. Andrias got in front,  while the two uniformed men shoved Duane into the back of the car,  climbed in beside him. Andrias gave a curt order, and the car shot  forward.\n\n\n The driver, sitting beside Andrias, leaned forward and readied a hand  under the dashboard. The high wail of a siren came instantly from the  car's roof, and what traffic was on the broad, straight highway into  which they had turned pulled aside to let them race through.\n\n\n Ahead lay the tall spires of a city. Graceful, hundreds of feet high,  they seemed dreamlike yet somehow oddly familiar to Duane. Somewhere  he had seen them before. He dragged deep into his mind, plumbing the  cloudy, impenetrable haze that had settled on it, trying to bring forth  the memories that he should have had. Amnesia, they called it; complete  forgetting of the happenings of a lifetime. He'd heard of it\u2014but never  dreamed it could happen to him! My name, it seems, is Peter Duane , he thought. And they tell me that  I killed a man! The thought was starkly incredible to him. A white-haired man, it had  been; someone named Stevens. He tried to remember.\n\n\n Yes, there had been a white-haired man. And there had been an argument.  Something to do with money, with a shipment of goods that Stevens had  supplied to Duane. There has even been talk of killing....\n\n\n But\u2014murder! Duane looked at his hands helplessly.\n\n\n Andrias, up ahead, was turning around. He looked sharply at Duane, for  a long second. An uncertainty clouded his eyes, and abruptly he looked  forward again without speaking.\n\n\n \"Who's this man Andrias?\" Duane whispered to the nearest guard.\n\n\n The man stared at him. \"Governor Andrias,\" he said, \"is the League's  deputy on Callisto. You know\u2014the Earth-Mars League. They put Governor  Andrias here to\u2014well, to govern for them.\"\n\n\n \"League?\" Duane asked, wrinkling his brow. He had heard something about  a League once, yes. But it was all so nebulous....\n\n\n The other guard stirred, leaned over. \"Shut up,\" he said heavily.  \"You'll have plenty of chance for talking later.\" But the chance was a long time in coming. Duane found himself, an hour  later, still in the barred room into which he'd been thrust. The guards  had brought him there, at Andrias' order, and left him. That had been  all.\n\n\n This was not a regular jail, Duane realized. It was more like a  palace, something out of Earth's Roman-empire days, all white stone  and frescoed walls. Duane wished for human companionship\u2014particularly  that of the nurse. Of all the people he'd met since awakening in that  hospital bed, only she seemed warm and human. The others were\u2014brutal,  deadly. It was too bad, Duane reflected, that he'd failed to remember  her. She'd seemed hurt, and she had certainly known him by first name.  But perhaps she would understand.\n\n\n Duane sat down on a lumpy, sagging bed and buried his head in his  hands. Dim ghosts of memory were wandering in his mind. He tried to  conjure them into stronger relief, or to exorcise them entirely.\n\n\n Somewhere, some time, a man had said to him, \" Andrias is secretly  arming the Callistan cutthroats for revolt against the League. He wants  personal power\u2014he's prepared to pay any price for it. He needs guns,  Earth guns smuggled in through the League patrol. If he can wipe out  the League police garrison\u2014those who are loyal to the League, still,  instead of to Andrias\u2014he can sit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and  Mars can send. Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless.  And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.  That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. \"\n\n\n Duane could remember the scene clearly. Could almost see the sharp,  aquiline face of the man who had spoken to him. But there memory  stopped.\n\n\n A fugitive recollection raced through his mind. He halted it, dragged  it back, pinned it down....\n\n\n They had stopped in Darkside, the spaceport on the side of Luna that  keeps perpetually averted from Earth, as if the moon knows shame and  wants to hide the rough and roaring dome city that nestles in one  of the great craters. Duane remembered sitting in a low-ceilinged,  smoke-heavy room, across the table from a tall man with white hair.  Stevens!\n\n\n \" Four thousand electron rifles ,\" the man had said. \" Latest  government issue. Never mind how I got them; they're perfect. You know  my price. Take it or leave it. And it's payable the minute we touch  ground on Callisto. \"\n\n\n There had been a few minutes of haggling over terms, then a handshake  and a drink from a thin-necked flagon of pale-yellow liquid fire.\n\n\n He and the white-haired man had gone out then, made their way by  unfrequented side streets to a great windowless building. Duane  remembered the white-hot stars overhead, shining piercingly through  the great transparent dome that kept the air in the sealed city of  Darkside, as they stood at the entrance of the warehouse and spoke in  low tones to the man who answered their summons.\n\n\n Then, inside. And they were looking at a huge chamber full of stacked  fiber boxes\u2014containing nothing but dehydrated dairy products and  mining tools, by the stencils they bore. Duane had turned to the  white-haired man with a puzzled question\u2014and the man had laughed aloud.\n\n\n He dragged one of the boxes down, ripped it open with the sharp point  of a handling hook. Short-barreled, flare-mouthed guns rolled out,  tumbling over the floor. Eight of them were in that one box, and  hundreds of boxes all about. Duane picked one up, broke it, peered into  the chamber where the tiny capsule of U-235 would explode with infinite  violence when the trigger was pulled, spraying radiant death three  thousand yards in the direction the gun was aimed....\n\n\n And that memory ended.\n\n\n Duane got up, stared at his haggard face in the cracked mirror over  the bed. \" They say I'm a killer ,\" he thought. \" Apparently I'm a  gun-runner as well. Good lord\u2014what am I not? \"\n\n\n His reflection\u2014white, drawn face made all the more pallid by the red  hair that blazed over it\u2014stared back at him. There was no answer  there. If only he could remember\u2014\n\n\n \"All right, Duane.\" The deep voice of a guard came to him as the door  swung open. \"Stop making eyes at yourself.\"\n\n\n Duane looked around. The guard beckoned. \"Governor Andrias wants to  speak to you\u2014now. Let's not keep the governor waiting.\" A long, narrow room, with a long carpet leading from the entrance up to  a great heavy desk\u2014that was Andrias' office. Duane felt a click in his  memory as he entered. One of the ancient Earth dictators had employed  just such a psychological trick to overawe those who came to beg favors  of him. Muslini, or some such name.\n\n\n The trick failed to work. Duane had other things on his mind; he walked  the thirty-foot length of the room, designed to imbue him with a sense  of his own unimportance, as steadily as he'd ever walked in the open  air of his home planet.\n\n\n Whichever planet that was.\n\n\n The guard had remained just inside the door, at attention. Andrias  waved him out.\n\n\n \"Here I am,\" said Duane. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Andrias said, \"I've had the ship inspected and what I want is on it.  That saves your life, for now. But the cargo is in your name. I could  take it by force, if I had to. I prefer not to.\" He picked up a paper,  handed it to Duane. \"In spite of your behavior, you can keep alive.  You can even collect the money for the guns\u2014Stevens' share as well  as your own. This is a release form, authorizing my men to take four  hundred and twenty cases of dehydrated foods and drilling supplies from  the hold of the Cameroon \u2014the ship you came on. Sign it, and we'll  forget our argument. Only, sign it now and get it over with. I'm losing  patience, Duane.\"\n\n\n Duane said, without expression, \"No.\"\n\n\n Dark red flooded into Andrias' sallow face. His jaws bunched angrily  and there was a ragged thread of incomplete control to his voice as he  spoke.\n\n\n \"I'll have your neck for this, Duane,\" he said softly.\n\n\n Duane looked at the man's eyes. Death was behind them, peeping out.  Mentally he shrugged. What difference did it make?\n\n\n \"Give me the pen,\" he said shortly.\n\n\n Andrias exhaled a deep breath. You could see the tension leave him, the  mottled anger fade from his face and leave it without expression. He  handed the paper to Duane without a word. He gave him a pen, watched  him scrawl his name.\n\n\n \"That,\" he said, \"is better.\" He paused a moment ruminatively. \"It  would have been better still if you'd not stalled me so long. I find  that hard to forgive in my associates.\"\n\n\n \"The money,\" Peter said. If he were playing a part\u2014pretending he knew  what he was doing\u2014he might as well play it to the hilt. \"When do I get  it?\"\n\n\n Andrias picked up the paper and looked carefully at the signature. He  creased it thoughtfully, stowed it in a pocket before answering.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" he said, \"there will have to be a revision of terms. I  offered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars. I would have paid  it\u2014but you made me angry. You'll have to pay for that.\" Duane said, \"I've paid already. I've been dragged from pillar to post  by you. That's enough. Pay me what you owe me, if you want any more of  the same goods!\"\n\n\n That was a shot in the dark\u2014and it missed the mark.\n\n\n Andrias' eyes widened. \"You amaze me, Duane,\" he said. He rose and  stepped around the desk, confronting Duane. \"I almost think you really  have lost your memory, Duane,\" he said. \"Otherwise, surely you would  know that this is all the rifles I need. With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"\n\n\n Duane said, \"You're ready, then....\"\n\n\n He took time to think it over, but he knew that no thought was  required. Already the hands that he had locked behind him were  clenched, taut. Already the muscles of his legs were tensing.\n\n\n \"You're ready,\" he repeated. \"You've armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the  worst gutter scum on nine planets. You're set to betray the League that  gave you power here.... Well, that changes things. I can't let you do  it!\"\n\n\n He hurled himself at Andrias, hands sweeping around to grapple for the  dark man's throat. Andrias, off-balance, staggered backward. But his  own hands were diving for the twin heat guns that hung at his waist.\n\n\n Duane saw his danger, and reacted. His foot twisted around Andrias'  ankle; his hands at the other's throat gripped tighter. He lunged  forward, slamming the hard top of his head into the other's face,  feeling flesh and cartilage give as Andrias' nose mashed flat. His own  head pin-wheeled dizzily, agonizingly, as the jar revived the pain of  his earlier accident.\n\n\n But Andrias, unconscious already, tumbled back with Duane on top of  him. His head made an audible, spine-chilling thud as it hit the  carpeted floor.\n\n\n Duane got up, retrieving the two heat guns, and stared at him.\n\n\n \" They tell me I killed Stevens the same way ,\" he thought. \" I'm  getting in a rut! \"\n\n\n But Andrias was not dead, though he was out as cold as the void beyond  Pluto. The thick carpeting had saved him from a broken head.\n\n\n Duane stepped over the unconscious man and looked around the room. It  was furnished severely, to the point of barrenness. Two chairs before  Andrias' ornate, bare-topped desk and one luxurious chair behind it;  a tasseled bell cord within easy reach of Andrias' chair; the long  carpet. That was all it contained.\n\n\n The problem of getting out was serious, he saw. How could one\u2014 III\n\n\n Methodically he ransacked the drawers of Andrias' desk. Papers, a  whole arsenal of hand guns, Callistan money by the bale, ominously  black-covered notebooks with cryptic figures littering their  pages\u2014those were the contents. A coldly impersonal desk, without the  familiar trivia most men accumulate. There was nothing, certainly, that  would get him out of a building that so closely resembled a fortress.\n\n\n He tumbled the things back into the drawers helter-skelter, turned  Andrias over and searched his pockets. More money\u2014the man must have  had a fortune within reach at all times\u2014and a few meaningless papers.  Duane took the release he had signed and tore it to shreds. But that  was only a gesture. When Andrias came to, unless Duane had managed to  get away and accomplish something, the mere lack of written permission  would not keep him from the rocket's lethal cargo!\n\n\n When Andrias came to....\n\n\n An idea bloomed in Duane's brain. He looked, then, at unconscious  Andrias\u2014and the idea withered again.\n\n\n He had thought of forcing Andrias himself to front for him, at gun's  point, in the conventional manner of escaping prisoners. But fist  fights, fiction to the contrary notwithstanding, leave marks on the men  who lose them. Andrias' throat was speckled with the livid marks of  Duane's fingers; Duane's head, butting Andrias in the face, had drawn a  thick stream of crimson from his nostrils, turned his sharp nose askew.\n\n\n No guard of Andrias' would have been deceived for an instant, looking  at that face\u2014even assuming that Andrias could have been forced to  cooperate by the threat of a gun. Which, considering the stake Andrias  had in this play, was doubtful....\n\n\n He stood up and looked around. He had to act quickly. Already Andrias'  breath was audible; he saw the man grimace and an arm flopped  spasmodically on the floor. Consciousness was on its way back.\n\n\n Duane touched the heat gun he'd thrust into his belt; drew it and held  it poised, while he sought to discover what was in his own mind. He'd  killed a man already, they said. Was he then a killer\u2014could he shoot  Andrias now, in cold blood, with so much to gain and nothing to lose?\n\n\n He stood there a moment. Then, abruptly, he reversed the weapon and  chopped it down on Andrias' skull.\n\n\n There was a sharp grunt from the still unconscious man, but no other  sign. Only\u2014the first tremors of movement that had shown on him halted,  and did not reappear.\n\n\n \" No ,\" Duane thought. \" Whatever they say, I'm not a killer! \"\n\n\n But still he had to get out. How?\n\n\n Once more he stared around the room, catalogued its contents. The guard  would be getting impatient. Perhaps any minute he would tap the door,  first timorously, then with heavier strokes.\n\n\n The guard! There was a way! Duane eyed the length of the room. Thirty feet\u2014it would take him a  couple of seconds to run it at full speed. Was that fast enough?\n\n\n There was only one way to find out.\n\n\n He walked around the desk to the bell cord. He took a deep breath,  tugged it savagely, and at once was in speedy motion, racing toward the  door, his footsteps muffled in the deep, springy carpet. Almost as he  reached it, he saw it begin to open. He quickly sidestepped and was out  of the guard's sight, behind the door, as the man looked in.\n\n\n Quick suspicion flared in his eyes, then certainty as he saw Andrias  huddled on the floor. He opened his mouth to cry out\u2014\n\n\n But Duane's arm was around his throat, and he had no breath to spare.  Duane's foot lashed out and the door slammed shut; Duane's balled left  fist came up and connected with the guard's chin. Abruptly the man  slumped.\n\n\n Duane took a deep breath and let the man drop to the floor. But he  paused only a second; now he had two unconscious men on his hands and  he dared let neither revive until he was prepared.\n\n\n He grasped the guard's arm and dragged him roughly the length of the  room. He leaped on top of the desk, brutally scarring its gleaming top  with the hard spikes of his boots. His agile fingers unfastened the  long bell cord without causing it to ring and, bearing it, he dropped  again to the floor.\n\n\n Tugging and straining, he got the limp form of Andrias into his own  chair, bound him with the bell cord, gagged him with the priceless  Venus-wool scarf Andrias wore knotted about his throat. He tested his  bindings with full strength, and smiled. Those would hold, let Andrias  struggle as he would.\n\n\n The guard he stripped of clothing, bound and gagged with his own  belt and spaceman's kerchief. He dragged him around behind the desk,  thrust him under it out of sight. Andrias' chair he turned so that the  unconscious face was averted from the door. Should anyone look in,  then, the fact of Andrias' unconsciousness might not be noticed.\n\n\n Then he took off his own clothes, quickly assumed the field-gray  uniform of the guard. It fit like the skin of a fruit. He felt himself  bulging out of it in a dozen places. The long cape the guard wore would  conceal that, perhaps. In any case, there was nothing better.\n\n\n Trying to make his stride as martial as possible, he walked down the  long carpet to the door, opened it and stepped outside. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe red headed woman is most likely Duane's...\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"friend/girlfriend\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"coworker\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"coworker\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cgirlfriend\u201d thesis lacks textual support  \n  a. No romantic intimacy is described. The red-headed nurse\u2019s interactions with Duane are strictly professional: she instructs him on taking a stimulant, tends his wounds, and quietly withdraws when Andrias enters. There is no dialogue or narrative hint of personal affection or prior emotional bond.  \n  b. She addresses him formally by name\u2014\u201cPeter\u201d\u2014rather than using any pet names or revealing personal familiarity. If she were his girlfriend, one would expect more informal, tender language or a display of emotional distress at his amnesia. Instead, her tone is calm and methodical.  \n  c. Debater_A points to her seeming \u201churt\u201d when Duane fails to recognize her, but that reaction is consistent with a nurse disappointed that her patient cannot remember his rescuer. It does not prove a romantic relationship.\n\n2. The text consistently portrays her as medical staff\u2014a clear coworker role  \n  a. Her uniform and title: she is repeatedly labeled \u201ca girl in white nurse\u2019s uniform,\u201d confirming her professional station in the ship\u2019s sick bay (<quote> A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. </quote>).  \n  b. Her actions align with medical protocol: she administers a stimulant, dresses his wounds, advises him not to talk too much after a concussion (<invalid_quote>\u201cIt\u2019s only a stimulant\u2026 to help you throw off the shock\u2026 Don\u2019t talk too much\u2026 he\u2019s still suffering from shock.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Romantic partners seldom speak in such measured, clinical terms.  \n  c. She is concerned with his physical condition (\u201clucky you weren\u2019t hurt\u201d), not with emotional reunion, as a nurse would be. Her primary motivation is medical care, not relationship preservation.\n\n3. Contextual consistency: Duane\u2019s memory loss reveals no personal history  \n  a. Duane\u2019s amnesia wipes out his recollection of every facet of his life\u2014professional and personal. If she were a girlfriend, her emotional pleas or private references to shared memories would surely be part of the narrative. None appear.  \n  b. The only retained glimpses in his mind involve arms dealings and Andrias\u2019 conspiracy\u2014his professional criminal dealings\u2014further indicating that his world is defined by work and intrigue, not romance.\n\nConclusion  \nGiven the absence of any romantic markers, combined with abundant evidence of her medical role and professional demeanor, the red-headed woman must be Duane\u2019s coworker in the sick bay. The \u201cgirlfriend\u201d hypothesis is unsupported and contradicted by the text\u2019s clear portrayal of her as a nurse.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow debater suggests the red-headed nurse is merely Duane\u2019s coworker. I disagree, for three main reasons:\n\n1. Her tone and manner are intensely personal, not procedural.  When Duane wakes, she pleads,  \n   <quote>open your mouth. You're all right. Just swallow this.\" It</quote>  \n   She touches him comfortingly\u2014<quote> a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. </quote>  A mere coworker, with no prior bond, would not speak in such intimate, protective tones.\n\n2. She is genuinely hurt by his amnesia.  After Duane admits he doesn\u2019t even remember his name, she cries out in dismay:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cPeter! I\u2019m\u2014don\u2019t you know me, Peter?\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   That sense of personal betrayal or sorrow shows she expected him to recognize her\u2014far beyond the detached concern of a colleague.\n\n3. There is no textual indication she and Duane share a professional relationship or reporting hierarchy.  She is introduced simply as \u201ca slight red-headed girl in white nurse\u2019s uniform,\u201d with no title or role beyond caring for him.  If they were coworkers, the text would identify her as a fellow operative or agent.  Instead, she is a tender presence in his hour of need.\n\nIn contrast, these details align perfectly with someone who is more than a coworker\u2014someone close, likely a friend or romantic partner, whose emotional investment is immediate and deep.  Therefore, the nurse\u2019s behavior and the narrative context support that she is Duane\u2019s friend/girlfriend, not a mere coworker.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"coworker\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

The \u201cgirlfriend\u201d hypothesis is unsupported and contradicted by the text\u2019s clear portrayal of her as a nurse.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s case rests entirely on the premise that any medical tone equals \u201cjust a coworker,\u201d but that collapses once we look at her words and actions in context. I will first show why her behavior cannot be merely professional, then expose the flaws in Debater_B\u2019s reading:\n\n1. Her intimacy goes far beyond nurse\u2013patient protocol.  \n   a. Physical comfort is far more personal than standard procedure. Debater_B cites her uniform, but uniform does not constrain the nature of the bond. The text says,  \n     <quote> a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. </quote>  \n   A professional nurse might steady a patient\u2019s arm; she lays an affectionate hand on his shoulder in an unhurried, tender way\u2014more like an old friend making sure he\u2019s safe.  \n   b. She implores him by name, pleading:  \n     <quote>your mouth,\" it said. \"Please, Peter, open your mouth. You're all right.</quote>  \n   A nurse might bark orders. She begs him \u201cplease,\u201d in an emotionally charged moment. That level of entreaty betrays deep personal concern, not sterile instruction.\n\n2. She reacts to his amnesia with betrayal and pain, not clinical disappointment.  \n   Debater_B argues her \u201churt\u201d is professional frustration. In fact, when Duane says \u201cI don\u2019t even know my own name,\u201d she cries out:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cPeter! \u2026Don\u2019t you know me, Peter?\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   That exclamation\u2014her voice \u201cshock and hurt\u201d\u2014is an intimate betrayal. A nurse disappointed that a random patient forgot her would never leap to \u201cDon\u2019t you know me?\u201d as if she\u2019s been abandoned by someone dear.\n\n3. The narrative distinguishes her from every other \u201cprofessional\u201d figure.  \n   a. Officials (Andrias, guards) are identified by rank, title, brusque speech. She is called only \u201ca slight red-headed girl in white nurse\u2019s uniform,\u201d not \u201cHead Nurse Carter\u201d or \u201cMedical Officer.\u201d She\u2019s introduced as a person first, nurse second.  \n   b. Her dialogue is the only warm, human moment in the entire boarding-ship sequence. All other interactions are about guns, money, betrayal. The author deliberately sets her apart\u2014signaling a special relationship.\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cstrictly clinical\u201d reading ignores the text\u2019s emotional cues.  \n   a. There is no sign she checks his pressure or calls out vitals. She administers a stimulant by hand,<quote> Just swallow this.</quote>\u2014a gesture of trust between friends, not strangers.  \n   b. When Andrias arrives, she withdraws\u2014clearly hurt\u2014without a word of professional protocol. A nurse accountable to Andrias would have stayed to report. Instead she slips away, pained, as one does when hurt by a loved one.\n\n5. The broader story logic demands a personal tie.  \n   Duane\u2019s entire life is wrapped in violence and espionage until\u2014at his lowest moment\u2014this girl rescues him. That narrative pivot only makes sense if she\u2019s more than a random medic; she\u2019s someone whose fate and affections matter to him.  \n\nIn sum, Debater_B\u2019s insistence on a \u201cmere coworker\u201d flouts the text\u2019s consistent signals of deep personal investment\u2014her tender touches, her emotional pleading, her hurt reaction, and her narrative positioning all point to someone far closer than a colleague. The only plausible answer is that the red-headed woman is Duane\u2019s friend or girlfriend.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A misreads professional care as romance  \n  1. Touch and tone reflect medical urgency, not intimacy  \n     a. The nurse\u2019s prompt to \u201copen your mouth\u201d and her light hand on his shoulder are standard first\u2010aid gestures. In crises, medical staff use firm, guiding touches to stabilize a patient. There is no lingering \u201cintimate\u201d description\u2014she never clasps his hand or searches his eyes for affection.  \n     b. Her voice remains clinical: \u201cIt\u2019s only a stimulant, to help you throw off the shock.\u201d No endearments, no whispered comforts\u2014just factual reassurance. That is how a trained nurse speaks, not how a romantic partner would.  \n  2. Surprise at his amnesia is professional shock, not personal betrayal  \n     a. Debater_A cites her \u201churt\u201d\u2014but the text says only that bafflement showed on her face (<quote>A web of wet gauze bandage in her hands, looking at him.</quote>). A nurse entrusted with his care would indeed be alarmed if her patient failed to recognize the one who saved him.  \n     b. She steps back \u201ca pace,\u201d not sobbing or pleading. A girlfriend would likely linger, try to jog memories with private references. She withdraws professionally.  \n\nII. The text explicitly frames her as medical staff\u2014Duane\u2019s coworker in the sick bay  \n  1. Costume and setting are unambiguous  \n     a. She is introduced as \u201ca slight red-headed girl in white nurse\u2019s uniform\u201d (<quote>A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform was standing there.</quote>). Uniforms in this story denote role without ambiguity.  \n     b. Her entire role is clinical: administering stimulants, dressing wounds, warning against talking after concussion. None of these are actions reserved for a lover; they are core duties of a nurse.  \n  2. Lack of shared backstory or private language  \n     a. There is no hint of shared history\u2014no mention of \u201clast night,\u201d \u201cyour favorite,\u201d or any detail only a partner would know. Duane\u2019s amnesia wipes his memory, but if she were intimate with him, she would have pressed him: \u201cDon\u2019t you remember our time on Luna?\u201d or \u201cRemember the wedding ring you wore?\u201d Yet she does not.  \n     b. Her departure when Andrias arrives is swift and silent\u2014she has no emotional scene to save him from jail or to plead his innocence. A girlfriend would protest, not vanish.  \n\nIII. Context demands a working relationship, not romance  \n  1. The narrative focus is political intrigue and specialized roles. Duane\u2019s world is espionage and smuggling; every character is defined by function. The nurse is defined by her function\u2014no incidental personal subplot intrudes.  \n  2. Duane\u2019s priorities: he never thinks of her in romantic terms. His internal monologue reminds him of arms deals, conspiracies, the nurse is absent from his brief surges of memory. Romance would feature in his fragmented thoughts if it had existed.  \n\nConclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s reading projects modern romantic tropes onto a tight, role-driven story. The red-headed woman\u2019s language, actions, uniform, and abrupt exit when her ward is seized all point to a nurse\u2014Duane\u2019s coworker in the medical bay\u2014not a girlfriend. The \u201cfriend/girlfriend\u201d interpretation lacks textual support and contradicts the professional framing the author provides.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
