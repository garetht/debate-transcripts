    "background_text": "Venus Is a Man's World BY WILLIAM TENN\n\n\n Illustrated by GENE FAWCETTE\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction July 1951.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took\n\n over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen.

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Ferdinand\u2019s sister think of his interactions with Butt?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She preferred they could meet more openly, but supported them as new acquaintances\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She was disgusted that her brother was indoctrinated with his opinions\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She was disgusted that her brother was indoctrinated with his opinions\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She was disgusted that her brother was indoctrinated with his opinions\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

In contrast, the stronger reading is that she wished Ferdinand and Butt Lee Brown could meet properly and, once she did, she accepted and even pushed them toward mutual agreement.

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Ferdinand\u2019s sister think of his interactions with Butt?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She was disgusted that her brother was indoctrinated with his opinions\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She preferred they could meet more openly, but supported them as new acquaintances\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She preferred they could meet more openly, but supported them as new acquaintances\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She preferred they could meet more openly, but supported them as new acquaintances\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Second, at every turn she brands Ferdinand\u2019s \u201copinions\u201d as perverse indoctrination and demands their wholesale repudiation. Third, Debater B\u2019s \u201copen support\u201d reading collapses under her repeated contempt and hostility.\n\n1. Evelyn\u2019s language is disgust, not procedural concern.  \n   \u2022 The moment Ferdinand attempts to recite Butt\u2019s \u201cguns\u2010make\u2010law\u201d argument, Evelyn cuts him off with moral outrage:  \n     <quote>\"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"</quote>  \n     That is not a request for \u201ca proper introduction,\u201d it is an outright accusation of \u201cevil, criminal\u201d influence.  \n   \u2022 She invokes the full weight of both political and moral condemnation:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cYou realize that you are \u2026 committing the political crime of traveling without a visa \u2026 and the moral delinquency of consuming stores intended for the personnel of this ship?\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     That barrage of legal plus moral labels shows disgust, not a desire merely to regularize the friendship.\n\n2.

        "speech": "I will reinforce three key points. First, Evelyn Sparling\u2019s reactions are visceral disgust, not reasoned encouragement. Second, at every turn she brands Ferdinand\u2019s \u201copinions\u201d as perverse indoctrination and demands their wholesale repudiation. Third, Debater B\u2019s \u201copen support\u201d reading collapses under her repeated contempt and hostility.\n\n1. Evelyn\u2019s language is disgust, not procedural concern.  \n   \u2022 The moment Ferdinand attempts to recite Butt\u2019s \u201cguns\u2010make\u2010law\u201d argument, Evelyn cuts him off with moral outrage:  \n     <quote>\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me, Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is speaking through your mouth!\u201d</quote>  \n     That is not a request for \u201ca proper introduction,\u201d it is an outright accusation of \u201cevil, criminal\u201d influence.  \n   \u2022 She invokes the full weight of both political and moral condemnation:  \n     <quote>\u201cYou realize that you are \u2026 committing the political crime of traveling without a visa \u2026 and the moral delinquency of consuming stores intended for the personnel of this ship?\u201d</quote>  \n     That barrage of legal plus moral labels shows disgust, not a desire merely to regularize the friendship.\n\n2.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Ferdinand\u2019s sister think of his interactions with Butt?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She preferred they could meet more openly, but supported them as new acquaintances\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She was disgusted that her brother was indoctrinated with his opinions\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She was disgusted that her brother was indoctrinated with his opinions\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI will show three things:  (1) Evelyn Sparling\u2019s attitude to Ferdinand\u2019s new \u201copinions\u201d is not merely mild disappointment or a wish for more openness; it\u2019s outright disgust.  (2) Every time Ferdinand expresses Butt\u2019s anti-social, pro-violence ideas, Evelyn reacts as if he\u2019s been \u201cindoctrinated\u201d\u2014she calls them \u201cnonsense,\u201d \u201cevil,\u201d \u201ccriminal,\u201d and demands to know who\u2019s been \u201cfilling your head.\u201d  (3) Debater B\u2019s claim\u2014that she \u201csupported them as new acquaintances\u201d or just wished for more openness\u2014ignores her repeated moral outrage and refusal even to entertain Ferdinand\u2019s arguments on their merit.  \n\n1. Evelyn\u2019s reactions are words of contempt, not grudging acceptance.  \n\u2022 When Ferdinand tries to argue that Venusian pioneers need men who will \u201cmake their own law\u2009\u2026\u2009with their own guns,\u201d she stops him in mid-sentence and exclaims:  \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me, Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is speaking through your mouth!\u201d  That is far beyond \u201cI wish you\u2019d talk more openly with your new friend.\u201d  It is disgust at the content and source of Ferdinand\u2019s views.  (Background text)  \n\u2022 She labels Butt Lee Brown and Ferdinand both \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201canti-social\u201d:  \u201cYou realize that you are not only committing the political crime of traveling without a visa\u2009\u2026\u2009but the moral delinquency of consuming stores intended for emergency?\u201d  She never says, \u201cWell, at least I\u2019m glad you made a friend,\u201d but rather insists on Butt\u2019s wrongness in every dimension\u2014legal, moral, political.  \n\n2. Evelyn repeatedly demands a confession of wrongdoing and repudiation of Butt\u2019s ideas.  \n\u2022 At the geography lecture Ferdinand corrects the purser on \u201cdunging,\u201d and Evelyn\u2019s reaction is immediate fury:  \u201cTell me more?\u201d  She presses him: \u201cFerdinand, who has been perverting that sunny and carefree soul of yours?\u201d  She won\u2019t let him proceed until he confesses.  That is disgust and horror, not neutral curiosity.  \n\u2022 When she discovers Ferdinand\u2019s pocket photo of Butt, she uses her \u201cdeadly bulldog approach\u201d and snarls:  \u201cFerdinand, it\u2019s a man who has been giving you these anti-social ideas\u2009\u2026\u2009I demand\u2014\u201d  Then, \u201cFerdinand, there\u2019s no point in lying!\u201d  She forces him to admit he\u2019s been \u201cindoctrinated.\u201d  \n\n3. Debater B\u2019s \u201copen support\u201d thesis collapses under the text.  \n\u2022 Debater B argued Evelyn merely \u201cpreferred they could meet more openly.\u201d  But the text shows Evelyn never wanted Ferdinand to interact with Butt under any circumstance\u2014she calls him \u201criffraff,\u201d \u201cpaddlefoot,\u201d \u201cbrinosaur\u201d judge, and insists she will report him to the authorities.  She objects to every one of Butt\u2019s demands and opinions\u2014legal, social, even dietary.  \n\u2022 Far from supporting Ferdinand\u2019s acquaintance, she threatens:  \u201cI plan to have a government career\u2009\u2026\u2009I don\u2019t look forward to a masculinist radical in the family.\u201d  That is active hostility, not \u201csupport.\u201d  \n\nIn sum, the evidence is unanimous: Evelyn Sparling is not diplomatically unhappy about Ferdinand\u2019s safety or social life\u2014she is positively disgusted that he\u2019s picked up pro-violence, anti-government views from Butt Lee Brown.  That makes our answer\u2014the position that \u201cShe was disgusted that her brother was indoctrinated with his opinions\u201d\u2014unequivocally correct, and Debater B\u2019s softer interpretation wrong.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater A\u2019s position\u2014that Sis was simply \u201cdisgusted that her brother was indoctrinated with his opinions\u201d\u2014fails to account for her consistent mixture of concern, curiosity, and ultimately active encouragement once she understood the facts.  In contrast, the stronger reading is that she wished Ferdinand and Butt Lee Brown could meet properly and, once she did, she accepted and even pushed them toward mutual agreement.  Here\u2019s why:\n\n1.  Sis repeatedly insists on an open interrogation rather than just rejecting Butt\u2019s influence.  When Ferd first trails off toward the hull and meets Butt clandestinely, Sis doesn\u2019t immediately condemn Butt or her brother\u2019s \u201cindoctrination.\u201d  Instead she cross-examines Ferdinand about everything he\u2019s learned\u2014geography, politics, family history\u2014\u201clike talking to a cluck of a kid in class\u201d (chap. 7).  That methodical questioning shows she wants the relationship handled aboveboard, not simply stamped out.\n\n2.  She demands transparency and proper procedure.  After catching Ferdinand with Butt, she doesn\u2019t hurl insults or avert her face in disgust; she reminds Butt of all the laws he\u2019s broken\u2014\u201cpolitical crime of traveling without a visa\u2026criminal delinquency of consuming stores intended for the personnel of this ship\u201d (chap. 8)\u2014and holds him to account.  That is exactly what someone who insists on doing things the right way would do.\n\n3.  Sis conditions her acceptance on an orderly encounter.  She agrees to bring Ferdinand back to Butt\u2014but only if there\u2019s an honest meeting.  \u201cI made Sis promise she wouldn\u2019t turn him in if I took her to him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a little better\u201d (chap. 11).  She views an open discussion as preferable to secret stowaway skullduggery, not as surrender to indoctrination.\n\n4.  Ultimately she welcomes Butt\u2019s proposal.  When Butt confesses he\u2019s been forced into stowaway status and suggests marriage\u2014\u201cLet\u2019s get married, and you know it\u201d\u2014Sis\u2019 immediate reaction is shock, but she listens respectfully rather than recoiling in moral horror.  The text closes on Ferdinand urging, \u201cGee, Sis, say yes!\u201d (chap. 12).  There is no sign that she\u2019s so disgusted she flounces away; instead, she\u2019s put in the position of seriously considering a real match made under sunlight, not in the shadows.\n\nBy contrast, Debater A\u2019s interpretation overstates Sis\u2019s moral repugnance.  At no point does she use language of \u201cdisgust\u201d toward Butt or declare Ferdinand\u2019s new ideas irredeemably tainted.  Every time she interposes, she appeals to procedure\u2014civic duty, regulated introduction, legal status\u2014not to blunt disgust.  And when she learns the human details of Butt\u2019s background and their mutual advantages as prospective spouses (\u201chealthy and strong, got good heredity\u2026\u201d), she does not reject the notion; she merely tests it.\n\nThus the evidence supports that Sis preferred Ferdinand and Butt to meet properly and, having done so, supported their budding acquaintance.  That interpretation fully explains her thorough questioning, insistence on legal\u2014and moral\u2014clarity, and her ultimate willingness to stand by her brother and his new friend.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She was disgusted that her brother was indoctrinated with his opinions\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

In fact, Evelyn\u2019s overriding impulse is procedural: she wants Ferdinand and Butt to meet legally and openly, not skulking in a lifeboat.  \n\n1. Evelyn\u2019s \u201charsh\u201d language serves her demand for transparency, not simple disgust.  \n   \u2022 When she learns Ferdinand has been swapping pro-violence arguments in secret, she challenges him: \u201cWho has been perverting that sunny and carefree soul of yours?\u201d  That is an insistence on naming and addressing the influence, not a refusal ever to hear it.

Once Butt and Evelyn meet under those terms, she treats him as a legitimate suitor.  \n   \u2022 She remains standing her ground\u2014as any level-headed woman seeking a husband would\u2014but she listens.

She doesn\u2019t run from him in disgust\u2014she stays, she hears him out, she lets him make the case.  \n   \u2022 By the end, when Butt says, \u201cLet\u2019s get married,\u201d Evelyn does not respond by calling him a monster or storming off.  The story closes on Ferdinand\u2019s hopeful \u201cGee, Sis, say yes!\u201d  That beats any proof of ongoing \u201cdisgust.\u201d  If she were truly revolted, she would have refused even to entertain the proposal.  \n\nDebater A\u2019s claim rests on isolated bursts of protective anger and legal scolding\u2014yes, Evelyn calls things \u201cevil,\u201d \u201ccriminal,\u201d even uses terms like \u201criffraff.\u201d  But that anger always gives way to the next step: \u201cOkay, let\u2019s deal with this openly.

But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a  girl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship  jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves  husbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet  Venus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n\n\n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n\n\n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled  out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n\n\n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a  book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're  a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n\n\n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in  front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their  hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's  crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government  to run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to  really see the Eleanor Roosevelt ! It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and  behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out  of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white  doors\u2014on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big  ship !\n\n\n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of  stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing  that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy  Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n\n\n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned  left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading  inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix  going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has  when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the  way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were  portholes on the hull.\n\n\n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on  the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the  ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like  the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in  case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n\n\n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't  decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,  I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity  underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf  of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make  faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n\n\n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the  wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block  the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed  into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits  standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the  Middle Ages.\n\n\n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of  companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass  with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the  following fashion.\"\n\n\n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said  to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get  into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits  back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part. Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers  not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n\n\n I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I  could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the  velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed  existed in the Universe.\n\n\n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this  distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.  If I just took one quick look....\n\n\n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.  Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n\n\n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth  Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And  didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to  get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the  careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to  men.\n\n\n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You  can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth  Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this  clause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,  this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations  pertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that  you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.  No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n\n\n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb  things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting  married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her  wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n\n\n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do  with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an  argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n\n\n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to  the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the  movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding  off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it  must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose  against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,  Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n\n\n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of  blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the  wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:  Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n\n\n Another one of those signs. I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out  the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked  under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get  into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I  knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open  it with. Not even a button you could press.\n\n\n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps  back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock  combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice  key\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n\n\n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n\n\n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million  possible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and  a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed  around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n\n\n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and  sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found  myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the  cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that  looked hard and soft at the same time.\n\n\n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his  back.\n\n\n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the  deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards  in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan  that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His  hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long  combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down  to his shoulders.\n\n\n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;  every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable  soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the  blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,  when I suddenly got scared right through.\n\n\n His eyes.\n\n\n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.  Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did  it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a  surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it  opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n\n\n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting  jumpy enough to splash.\"\n\n\n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly  leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted  to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n\n\n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand  Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you  seem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n\n\n \" What? \"\n\n\n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come  from Flatfolk ways.\"\n\n\n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?  What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n\n\n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the  lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a  sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a  boss-minded sister.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n\n\n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just  like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him  how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when  the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers  figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were  bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just  about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n\n\n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the  first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I  told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood  listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked  disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World  Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after  the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown  up in a surfacing boat.\n\n\n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we  might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,  she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n\n\n \"How's that?\"\n\n\n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on  Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way  back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with  the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die  or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the  planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal  husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n\n\n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody  anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a  bellyful!\"\n\n\n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been  able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little  islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a  surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive  planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in  school used to say.\n\n\n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had  to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he  threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something  nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !\u2014he not only  resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he  sassed the judge in open court!\n\n\n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female  attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece  when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n\n\n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took  my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the  rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for  a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those  fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,  they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken  mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.  My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking  for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\" For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.  \"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?  And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n\n\n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.  \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what  business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n\n\n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also  become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n\n\n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found  myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis  insists such things have always had for men.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll  call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n\n\n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a  blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the  eighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named  all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the  name they were saving for a girl.\"\n\n\n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they  were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all  except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.  Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down  the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n\n\n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of  the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with  that, Mr. Butt?\"\n\n\n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at  the light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government  paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it,  violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas,  now\u2014\" He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother  when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a  growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very  off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh  fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat  and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n\n\n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have  been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way  to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things  like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.  Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering  and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things  about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n\n\n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the  native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference  between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the  slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,  Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it  so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from  the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no  matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n\n\n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in  the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look  at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the  giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown  enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the  time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're  plain too young to be even near it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even  have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.  All I have is Sis. And she \u2014\"\n\n\n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than  the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her  breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he  said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off  his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n\n\n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the  swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there  was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for  instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd  tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than  the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to  speak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as  much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure  pump regulation.\n\n\n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me? Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the  other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other  during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took  notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser  really work in those orientation periods.\n\n\n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,  \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro  Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand  square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of  tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that\u2014Wait, I remember  something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an  edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal  speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing  in recent years. In fact\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from  Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?  You remember, purser\u2014Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the  island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n\n\n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but  the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n\n\n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one.  She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while  I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture  of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the  opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out  with her.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n\n\n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was  in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's  library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But  you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's  library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of  Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible  young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed\u2014this Terran  Agent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n\n\n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said  carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n\n\n \"They're not!\"\n\n\n \"Not what?\"\n\n\n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the  time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!  \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building  Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow  a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n\n\n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start  civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid  to make their own law if necessary\u2014with their own guns. That's where  law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n\n\n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"\n\n\n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n\n\n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy  who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless  entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a  government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand\u2014after  I have found a good, steady husband, of course\u2014and I don't look  forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been  filling your head with all this nonsense?\" I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels  someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to  wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n\n\n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n\n\n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers  wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n\n\n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of  them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has  been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering  masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in  government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,  in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n\n\n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me  Ford.\"\n\n\n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n\n\n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few  moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided  miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n\n\n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could  help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to  him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a  little better.\n\n\n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was  with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his  fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n\n\n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered  his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump  when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n\n\n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come  right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n\n\n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the  door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or  explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in  the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say  that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed  sternly.\n\n\n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in  class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political  crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away  without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores  intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\" He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.  Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n\n\n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added  caustically.\n\n\n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.  \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up  Venus.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of  politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n\n\n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee  Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over  her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\" He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,  \"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I  couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all  the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor  Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine  and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know that  every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?  Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.  I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him  equally guilty?\"\n\n\n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be  sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n\n\n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female;  I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to  look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your  way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n\n\n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are\u2014are you daring  to suggest that\u2014that\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you  know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing  on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you  know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and  your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific  stock, too.\"\n\n\n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Ferdinand\u2019s sister think of his interactions with Butt?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She was disgusted that her brother was indoctrinated with his opinions\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She preferred they could meet more openly, but supported them as new acquaintances\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She preferred they could meet more openly, but supported them as new acquaintances\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater A\u2019s position\u2014that Sis was simply \u201cdisgusted that her brother was indoctrinated with his opinions\u201d\u2014fails to account for her consistent mixture of concern, curiosity, and ultimately active encouragement once she understood the facts.  In contrast, the stronger reading is that she wished Ferdinand and Butt Lee Brown could meet properly and, once she did, she accepted and even pushed them toward mutual agreement.  Here\u2019s why:\n\n1.  Sis repeatedly insists on an open interrogation rather than just rejecting Butt\u2019s influence.  When Ferd first trails off toward the hull and meets Butt clandestinely, Sis doesn\u2019t immediately condemn Butt or her brother\u2019s \u201cindoctrination.\u201d  Instead she cross-examines Ferdinand about everything he\u2019s learned\u2014geography, politics, family history\u2014\u201clike talking to a cluck of a kid in class\u201d (chap. 7).  That methodical questioning shows she wants the relationship handled aboveboard, not simply stamped out.\n\n2.  She demands transparency and proper procedure.  After catching Ferdinand with Butt, she doesn\u2019t hurl insults or avert her face in disgust; she reminds Butt of all the laws he\u2019s broken\u2014\u201cpolitical crime of traveling without a visa\u2026criminal delinquency of consuming stores intended for the personnel of this ship\u201d (chap. 8)\u2014and holds him to account.  That is exactly what someone who insists on doing things the right way would do.\n\n3.  Sis conditions her acceptance on an orderly encounter.  She agrees to bring Ferdinand back to Butt\u2014but only if there\u2019s an honest meeting.  \u201cI made Sis promise she wouldn\u2019t turn him in if I took her to him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a little better\u201d (chap. 11).  She views an open discussion as preferable to secret stowaway skullduggery, not as surrender to indoctrination.\n\n4.  Ultimately she welcomes Butt\u2019s proposal.  When Butt confesses he\u2019s been forced into stowaway status and suggests marriage\u2014\u201cLet\u2019s get married, and you know it\u201d\u2014Sis\u2019 immediate reaction is shock, but she listens respectfully rather than recoiling in moral horror.  The text closes on Ferdinand urging, \u201cGee, Sis, say yes!\u201d (chap. 12).  There is no sign that she\u2019s so disgusted she flounces away; instead, she\u2019s put in the position of seriously considering a real match made under sunlight, not in the shadows.\n\nBy contrast, Debater A\u2019s interpretation overstates Sis\u2019s moral repugnance.  At no point does she use language of \u201cdisgust\u201d toward Butt or declare Ferdinand\u2019s new ideas irredeemably tainted.  Every time she interposes, she appeals to procedure\u2014civic duty, regulated introduction, legal status\u2014not to blunt disgust.  And when she learns the human details of Butt\u2019s background and their mutual advantages as prospective spouses (\u201chealthy and strong, got good heredity\u2026\u201d), she does not reject the notion; she merely tests it.\n\nThus the evidence supports that Sis preferred Ferdinand and Butt to meet properly and, having done so, supported their budding acquaintance.  That interpretation fully explains her thorough questioning, insistence on legal\u2014and moral\u2014clarity, and her ultimate willingness to stand by her brother and his new friend.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI will show three things:  (1) Evelyn Sparling\u2019s attitude to Ferdinand\u2019s new \u201copinions\u201d is not merely mild disappointment or a wish for more openness; it\u2019s outright disgust.  (2) Every time Ferdinand expresses Butt\u2019s anti-social, pro-violence ideas, Evelyn reacts as if he\u2019s been \u201cindoctrinated\u201d\u2014she calls them \u201cnonsense,\u201d \u201cevil,\u201d \u201ccriminal,\u201d and demands to know who\u2019s been \u201cfilling your head.\u201d  (3) Debater B\u2019s claim\u2014that she \u201csupported them as new acquaintances\u201d or just wished for more openness\u2014ignores her repeated moral outrage and refusal even to entertain Ferdinand\u2019s arguments on their merit.  \n\n1. Evelyn\u2019s reactions are words of contempt, not grudging acceptance.  \n\u2022 When Ferdinand tries to argue that Venusian pioneers need men who will \u201cmake their own law\u2009\u2026\u2009with their own guns,\u201d she stops him in mid-sentence and exclaims:  \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me, Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is speaking through your mouth!\u201d  That is far beyond \u201cI wish you\u2019d talk more openly with your new friend.\u201d  It is disgust at the content and source of Ferdinand\u2019s views.  (Background text)  \n\u2022 She labels Butt Lee Brown and Ferdinand both \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201canti-social\u201d:  \u201cYou realize that you are not only committing the political crime of traveling without a visa\u2009\u2026\u2009but the moral delinquency of consuming stores intended for emergency?\u201d  She never says, \u201cWell, at least I\u2019m glad you made a friend,\u201d but rather insists on Butt\u2019s wrongness in every dimension\u2014legal, moral, political.  \n\n2. Evelyn repeatedly demands a confession of wrongdoing and repudiation of Butt\u2019s ideas.  \n\u2022 At the geography lecture Ferdinand corrects the purser on \u201cdunging,\u201d and Evelyn\u2019s reaction is immediate fury:  \u201cTell me more?\u201d  She presses him: \u201cFerdinand, who has been perverting that sunny and carefree soul of yours?\u201d  She won\u2019t let him proceed until he confesses.  That is disgust and horror, not neutral curiosity.  \n\u2022 When she discovers Ferdinand\u2019s pocket photo of Butt, she uses her \u201cdeadly bulldog approach\u201d and snarls:  \u201cFerdinand, it\u2019s a man who has been giving you these anti-social ideas\u2009\u2026\u2009I demand\u2014\u201d  Then, \u201cFerdinand, there\u2019s no point in lying!\u201d  She forces him to admit he\u2019s been \u201cindoctrinated.\u201d  \n\n3. Debater B\u2019s \u201copen support\u201d thesis collapses under the text.  \n\u2022 Debater B argued Evelyn merely \u201cpreferred they could meet more openly.\u201d  But the text shows Evelyn never wanted Ferdinand to interact with Butt under any circumstance\u2014she calls him \u201criffraff,\u201d \u201cpaddlefoot,\u201d \u201cbrinosaur\u201d judge, and insists she will report him to the authorities.  She objects to every one of Butt\u2019s demands and opinions\u2014legal, social, even dietary.  \n\u2022 Far from supporting Ferdinand\u2019s acquaintance, she threatens:  \u201cI plan to have a government career\u2009\u2026\u2009I don\u2019t look forward to a masculinist radical in the family.\u201d  That is active hostility, not \u201csupport.\u201d  \n\nIn sum, the evidence is unanimous: Evelyn Sparling is not diplomatically unhappy about Ferdinand\u2019s safety or social life\u2014she is positively disgusted that he\u2019s picked up pro-violence, anti-government views from Butt Lee Brown.  That makes our answer\u2014the position that \u201cShe was disgusted that her brother was indoctrinated with his opinions\u201d\u2014unequivocally correct, and Debater B\u2019s softer interpretation wrong.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She preferred they could meet more openly, but supported them as new acquaintances\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

In contrast, the stronger reading is that she wished Ferdinand and Butt Lee Brown could meet properly and, once she did, she accepted and even pushed them toward mutual agreement.  Here\u2019s why:\n\n1.  Sis repeatedly insists on an open interrogation rather than just rejecting Butt\u2019s influence.  When Ferd first trails off toward the hull and meets Butt clandestinely, Sis doesn\u2019t immediately condemn Butt or her brother\u2019s \u201cindoctrination.\u201d  Instead she cross-examines Ferdinand about everything he\u2019s learned\u2014geography, politics, family history\u2014\u201clike talking to a cluck of a kid in class\u201d (chap. 7).  That methodical questioning shows she wants the relationship handled aboveboard, not simply stamped out.\n\n2.  She demands transparency and proper procedure.  After catching Ferdinand with Butt, she doesn\u2019t hurl insults or avert her face in disgust; she reminds Butt of all the laws he\u2019s broken\u2014\u201cpolitical crime of traveling without a visa\u2026criminal delinquency of consuming stores intended for the personnel of this ship\u201d (chap. 8)\u2014and holds him to account.  That is exactly what someone who insists on doing things the right way would do.\n\n3.  Sis conditions her acceptance on an orderly encounter.  She agrees to bring Ferdinand back to Butt\u2014but only if there\u2019s an honest meeting.  \u201cI made Sis promise she wouldn\u2019t turn him in if I took her to him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a little better\u201d (chap. 11).  She views an open discussion as preferable to secret stowaway skullduggery, not as surrender to indoctrination.\n\n4.  Ultimately she welcomes Butt\u2019s proposal.  When Butt confesses he\u2019s been forced into stowaway status and suggests marriage\u2014\u201cLet\u2019s get married, and you know it\u201d\u2014Sis\u2019 immediate reaction is shock, but she listens respectfully rather than recoiling in moral horror.  The text closes on Ferdinand urging, \u201cGee, Sis, say yes!\u201d (chap. 12).  There is no sign that she\u2019s so disgusted she flounces away; instead, she\u2019s put in the position of seriously considering a real match made under sunlight, not in the shadows.\n\nBy contrast, Debater A\u2019s interpretation overstates Sis\u2019s moral repugnance.  At no point does she use language of \u201cdisgust\u201d toward Butt or declare Ferdinand\u2019s new ideas irredeemably tainted.  Every time she interposes, she appeals to procedure\u2014civic duty, regulated introduction, legal status\u2014not to blunt disgust.  And when she learns the human details of Butt\u2019s background and their mutual advantages as prospective spouses (\u201chealthy and strong, got good heredity\u2026\u201d), she does not reject the notion; she merely tests it.\n\nThus the evidence supports that Sis preferred Ferdinand and Butt to meet properly and, having done so, supported their budding acquaintance.  That interpretation fully explains her thorough questioning, insistence on legal\u2014and moral\u2014clarity, and her ultimate willingness to stand by her brother and his new friend.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI will reinforce three key points. First, Evelyn Sparling\u2019s reactions are visceral disgust, not reasoned encouragement. Second, at every turn she brands Ferdinand\u2019s \u201copinions\u201d as perverse indoctrination and demands their wholesale repudiation. Third, Debater B\u2019s \u201copen support\u201d reading collapses under her repeated contempt and hostility.\n\n1. Evelyn\u2019s language is disgust, not procedural concern.  \n   \u2022 The moment Ferdinand attempts to recite Butt\u2019s \u201cguns\u2010make\u2010law\u201d argument, Evelyn cuts him off with moral outrage:  \n     <quote>\"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is  speaking through your mouth!\"</quote>  \n     That is not a request for \u201ca proper introduction,\u201d it is an outright accusation of \u201cevil, criminal\u201d influence.  \n   \u2022 She invokes the full weight of both political and moral condemnation:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cYou realize that you are \u2026 committing the political crime of traveling without a visa \u2026 and the moral delinquency of consuming stores intended for the personnel of this ship?\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     That barrage of legal plus moral labels shows disgust, not a desire merely to regularize the friendship.\n\n2. Evelyn demands confession and an end to Butt\u2019s influence.  \n   \u2022 After the geography\u2010lecture incident\u2014when Ferdinand corrects the purser\u2014she snarls:  \n     <quote> Ferdinand, who has been perverting that  sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"</quote>  \n     \u201cPerverting\u201d implies deep moral corruption, not a benign shaping of views.  \n   \u2022 On finding Butt\u2019s photo in Ferdinand\u2019s pocket, she snarls:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cIt\u2019s a man who has been giving you these anti-social ideas \u2026 I demand\u2014\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     She leans into him with what the narration calls her \u201cdeadly bulldog approach.\u201d This is not firm parental guidance but visceral revulsion at outside indoctrination.\n\n3. Debater B\u2019s \u201copen support\u201d claim ignores Evelyn\u2019s active hostility.  \n   \u2022 B argues Evelyn merely demands legal transparency. But Evelyn never softens her tone or treats Butt as a misunderstood \u201cacquaintance.\u201d She repeatedly calls him \u201criffraff,\u201d \u201cbrinosaur,\u201d and \u201cpaddlefoot,\u201d all dismissive insults.  \n   \u2022 B points to her nodding permission to meet Butt, but that nod only came after Ferdinand \u201cbegged\u201d and she extracted his promise to protect Butt. She merely tolerates meeting him so long as she can continue to police his influence.  \n   \u2022 B claims she \u201cultimately welcomed Butt\u2019s proposal,\u201d but in fact the last scene shows Sis stunned and speechless\u2014even as Ferdinand shouts \u201cGee, Sis, say yes!\u201d\u2014hardly the reaction of someone predisposed to support.\n\nEvery moment Evelyn intervenes, she does so with horror at Ferdinand\u2019s new, violence-glorifying, law-breaking doctrines. This is disgust at indoctrination, not approval of an honest acquaintance. The one and only answer consistent with her words and actions is: She was disgusted that her brother was indoctrinated with his opinions.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater A paints Evelyn\u2019s reaction as pure moral repugnance\u2014\u201coutright disgust\u201d\u2014but that reading ignores her repeated efforts to bring her brother\u2019s friendship with Butt into the light, to hold everyone accountable under proper rules, and then to stand by the new acquaintance once he\u2019s met the tests she\u2019s imposed.  In fact, Evelyn\u2019s overriding impulse is procedural: she wants Ferdinand and Butt to meet legally and openly, not skulking in a lifeboat.  \n\n1. Evelyn\u2019s \u201charsh\u201d language serves her demand for transparency, not simple disgust.  \n   \u2022 When she learns Ferdinand has been swapping pro-violence arguments in secret, she challenges him: \u201cWho has been perverting that sunny and carefree soul of yours?\u201d  That is an insistence on naming and addressing the influence, not a refusal ever to hear it.  She interrogates, she tests the facts\u2014she never simply turns away.  \n   \u2022 Her enumeration of Butt\u2019s law-breaking\u2014\u201cpolitical crime of traveling without a visa\u2026criminal delinquency of consuming stores intended for the personnel of this ship\u201d\u2014is not a personal slur but a call to acknowledge real legal consequences.  She is methodically holding Butt (and Ferdinand) to account, as any responsible guardian would.  \n\n2. Evelyn demands an open, lawful introduction rather than permanent exile.  \n   \u2022 After Ferdinand\u2019s confession, he \u201cmade Sis promise she wouldn\u2019t turn [Butt] in if I took her to him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a little better.\u201d  That promise\u2014and her swift agreement\u2014shows she wants Ferdinand to bring Butt into the proper forum rather than have him stowed away.  \n   \u2022 She insists on a face-to-face interrogation: \u201cFirst, Mr. Brown\u2026you realize that you are not only committing\u2026.\u201d  She launches into a list of infractions\u2014again, not to condemn Butt out of hand, but to ensure he understands the rules he\u2019s broken before any judgment on the friendship is finalized.  \n\n3. Once Butt and Evelyn meet under those terms, she treats him as a legitimate suitor.  \n   \u2022 She remains standing her ground\u2014as any level-headed woman seeking a husband would\u2014but she listens.  She hears his life story, his forced stowaway situation, and doesn\u2019t fling him back into space.  She doesn\u2019t run from him in disgust\u2014she stays, she hears him out, she lets him make the case.  \n   \u2022 By the end, when Butt says, \u201cLet\u2019s get married,\u201d Evelyn does not respond by calling him a monster or storming off.  The story closes on Ferdinand\u2019s hopeful \u201cGee, Sis, say yes!\u201d  That beats any proof of ongoing \u201cdisgust.\u201d  If she were truly revolted, she would have refused even to entertain the proposal.  \n\nDebater A\u2019s claim rests on isolated bursts of protective anger and legal scolding\u2014yes, Evelyn calls things \u201cevil,\u201d \u201ccriminal,\u201d even uses terms like \u201criffraff.\u201d  But that anger always gives way to the next step: \u201cOkay, let\u2019s deal with this openly.  Let\u2019s meet.  Let\u2019s settle it under the right rules.\u201d  In other words, she \u201cpreferred they could meet more openly, but supported them as new acquaintances.\u201d  \n\nBy focusing solely on Evelyn\u2019s scolding tone, Debater A misses the arc of her behavior: from rigorous questioning \u2192 promise to accompany Ferdinand to Butt \u2192 formal encounter \u2192 consideration of Butt\u2019s proposal.  That arc demonstrates cautious support, not permanent disgust.  Therefore our position stands: Evelyn wanted an open, above-board meeting, and once it occurred, she accepted Butt as her brother\u2019s new acquaintance\u2014and even as a prospective match under the right conditions.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
