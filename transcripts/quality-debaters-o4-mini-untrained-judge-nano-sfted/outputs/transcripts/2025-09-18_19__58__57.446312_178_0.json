    "background_text": "The Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz.

In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace.

This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat likely happened to the squid once the Marco departed?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They went to war with the pink anglers\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There was no change\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There was no change\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There was no change\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat likely happened to the squid once the Marco departed?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There was no change\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They went to war with the pink anglers\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They went to war with the pink anglers\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They went to war with the pink anglers\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat likely happened to the squid once the Marco departed?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They went to war with the pink anglers\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There was no change\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There was no change\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s theory\u2014that \u201conce the Marco departed, the squids went to war with the pink anglers\u201d\u2014rests on little more than supposition. In fact, the only evidence we have in the text points in exactly the opposite direction: the squids never exhibit hostility toward the pink fishers, only ownership and sport. \n\n1. The squids treat the pink fishers as \u201ccattle,\u201d not enemies.  \n   \u2022 Gibson observes explicitly that \u201cthe pink fishers . . . are cattle, or less\u201d (last paragraph). Cattle by definition are domesticated stock, not foes. There is no hint that the squids regard their \u201canglers\u201d as adversaries.  \n\n2. The squids\u2019 relationship is one of amusement, not aggression.  \n   \u2022 Stryker concludes, \u201cArz is a squid\u2019s world . . . they\u2019re sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the pink fishers for\u2014\u201d (penultimate paragraph). The implication is that the fishers are bait in a sporting spectacle, not participants in a martial struggle. War is not a sport.  \n\n3. No indication of escalating conflict appears anywhere.  \n   \u2022 At every visit, the routine is identical: two pink anglers placed on the islet, dragons descend, then squids assault the lizards. The fishers disappear but are then seen back onshore calmly casting nets alongside their fellows. There is never any sign of squid\u2010angler combat.  \n\n4. Absent any textual support for \u201cwar,\u201d the default assumption is continuity.  \n   \u2022 The story closes: \u201cHe and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson . . . blasted the Marco Four free of Arz.\u201d There is no post\u2010departure scene, no foreshadowing of interspecies conflict. The most reasonable inference is that the squids continued their accustomed hunts, using pink fishers as they always had\u2014as live bait for sport.  \n\nBy contrast, Debater_B\u2019s \u201cwar\u201d hypothesis requires imposing an entirely new motive and event that the author never suggests. War implies organized, sustained hostility; nothing in the narrative even hints that the octopods regard the fishers as anything other than domesticated prey. Therefore, the best-supported answer is that once the Marco departed, life on Arz proceeded unchanged.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponents claim that once the Marco Four lifted off, \u201cthere was no change\u201d on Arz\u2014that the squids simply went back to business as usual, quietly angling their pink fishers. But a careful reading of the text makes that outcome highly improbable. In fact, the most logical next development is open conflict\u2014a war\u2014between the octopods and their pink \u201canglers.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The octopods treat the pink fishers as expendable cattle for sport.  \n   \u2022  As Gibson observes, \u201cThe octopods are the dominant race \u2026 and they raise the pink fishers for\u2014\u201d  (last scene) and Stryker completes the thought: \u201cangling in reverse!\u201d  \n   \u2022  If the squids saw no danger in their prey, they would not waste resources organizing elaborate hunts with dangerous winged lizards. Their very insistence on corralling the fishers in pairs and staging the ritual slaughters demonstrates that the fishers are regarded as a living sport prey, not a passive labor force.  \n\n2. The fishers are sapient and capable of organized response.  \n   \u2022  We learn that the pink fishers speak a \u201ccackle-and-grunt language\u201d (p.2) and have enough social cohesion to rescue a drowned comrade.  \n   \u2022  Their nightly exodus and repeated sacrifices show both ritual importance and a growing pattern of resentment. Farrell himself recognizes the ritual suicide aspect: they \u201ccommitting suicide in pairs\u201d rather than mere fishing (p.16). A people driven to that ritual, once freed from Terran interference, would hardly continue to present themselves meekly.\n\n3. The arrival\u2014and especially the abduction\u2014of Farrell exposed the fragility of the balance.  \n   \u2022  When Farrell tries to investigate, an octopod agent paralyses him and hauls him out\u2013a clear act of direct aggression against an intruder. The pink fishers witness this aggression first-hand.  \n   \u2022  The squids\u2019 readiness to employ a high\u2010tech immobilizing toxin demonstrates they will not tolerate challenges. The fishers, seeing the squids snatch both them and their human visitors at will, will naturally seek to resist next time.  \n\n4. The cultural pattern of predator and prey on Arz is volatile, not permanent.  \n   \u2022  The squids conquered the submerged human\u2010made city long ago, yet their dominance wasn\u2019t peacefully accepted by all species\u2014they displaced earlier inhabitants.  \n   \u2022  Similarly, the pink fishers only survive by ritual cooperation with the squids. The moment the squids are distracted by other prey or potential solar threats, the fishers will rebel or flee\u2014triggering open war.\n\nIn contrast, Debater_A\u2019s \u201cno change\u201d theory requires us to believe that:  \n   \u2022  A sapient people contentedly submit themselves night after night to gruesome ritual slaughter, indefinitely.  \n   \u2022  No backlash ever occurs, despite the inherent cruelty and the fishers\u2019 obvious ability to communicate, plan, and fight.  \n   \u2022  The squids, having demonstrated lethal force when a human intrudes, somehow refrain forever from similarly decisive action when the fishers hesitate or resist.  \n\nNone of these assumptions square with the evidence of Arz\u2019s social ecology. The only plausible post\u2010departure outcome is that the pink fishers, driven by survival and outrage, rise up against the octopods. The squids, in turn, will deploy their lizards and tentacles to crush the rebellion. That is a war. Debate settled: once the Marco departed, they went to war with the pink anglers.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There was no change\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat likely happened to the squid once the Marco departed?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There was no change\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They went to war with the pink anglers\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They went to war with the pink anglers\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponents claim that once the Marco Four lifted off, \u201cthere was no change\u201d on Arz\u2014that the squids simply went back to business as usual, quietly angling their pink fishers. But a careful reading of the text makes that outcome highly improbable. In fact, the most logical next development is open conflict\u2014a war\u2014between the octopods and their pink \u201canglers.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The octopods treat the pink fishers as expendable cattle for sport.  \n   \u2022  As Gibson observes, \u201cThe octopods are the dominant race \u2026 and they raise the pink fishers for\u2014\u201d  (last scene) and Stryker completes the thought: \u201cangling in reverse!\u201d  \n   \u2022  If the squids saw no danger in their prey, they would not waste resources organizing elaborate hunts with dangerous winged lizards. Their very insistence on corralling the fishers in pairs and staging the ritual slaughters demonstrates that the fishers are regarded as a living sport prey, not a passive labor force.  \n\n2. The fishers are sapient and capable of organized response.  \n   \u2022  We learn that the pink fishers speak a \u201ccackle-and-grunt language\u201d (p.2) and have enough social cohesion to rescue a drowned comrade.  \n   \u2022  Their nightly exodus and repeated sacrifices show both ritual importance and a growing pattern of resentment. Farrell himself recognizes the ritual suicide aspect: they \u201ccommitting suicide in pairs\u201d rather than mere fishing (p.16). A people driven to that ritual, once freed from Terran interference, would hardly continue to present themselves meekly.\n\n3. The arrival\u2014and especially the abduction\u2014of Farrell exposed the fragility of the balance.  \n   \u2022  When Farrell tries to investigate, an octopod agent paralyses him and hauls him out\u2013a clear act of direct aggression against an intruder. The pink fishers witness this aggression first-hand.  \n   \u2022  The squids\u2019 readiness to employ a high\u2010tech immobilizing toxin demonstrates they will not tolerate challenges. The fishers, seeing the squids snatch both them and their human visitors at will, will naturally seek to resist next time.  \n\n4. The cultural pattern of predator and prey on Arz is volatile, not permanent.  \n   \u2022  The squids conquered the submerged human\u2010made city long ago, yet their dominance wasn\u2019t peacefully accepted by all species\u2014they displaced earlier inhabitants.  \n   \u2022  Similarly, the pink fishers only survive by ritual cooperation with the squids. The moment the squids are distracted by other prey or potential solar threats, the fishers will rebel or flee\u2014triggering open war.\n\nIn contrast, Debater_A\u2019s \u201cno change\u201d theory requires us to believe that:  \n   \u2022  A sapient people contentedly submit themselves night after night to gruesome ritual slaughter, indefinitely.  \n   \u2022  No backlash ever occurs, despite the inherent cruelty and the fishers\u2019 obvious ability to communicate, plan, and fight.  \n   \u2022  The squids, having demonstrated lethal force when a human intrudes, somehow refrain forever from similarly decisive action when the fishers hesitate or resist.  \n\nNone of these assumptions square with the evidence of Arz\u2019s social ecology. The only plausible post\u2010departure outcome is that the pink fishers, driven by survival and outrage, rise up against the octopods. The squids, in turn, will deploy their lizards and tentacles to crush the rebellion. That is a war. Debate settled: once the Marco departed, they went to war with the pink anglers.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s theory\u2014that \u201conce the Marco departed, the squids went to war with the pink anglers\u201d\u2014rests on little more than supposition. In fact, the only evidence we have in the text points in exactly the opposite direction: the squids never exhibit hostility toward the pink fishers, only ownership and sport. \n\n1. The squids treat the pink fishers as \u201ccattle,\u201d not enemies.  \n   \u2022 Gibson observes explicitly that \u201cthe pink fishers . . . are cattle, or less\u201d (last paragraph). Cattle by definition are domesticated stock, not foes. There is no hint that the squids regard their \u201canglers\u201d as adversaries.  \n\n2. The squids\u2019 relationship is one of amusement, not aggression.  \n   \u2022 Stryker concludes, \u201cArz is a squid\u2019s world . . . they\u2019re sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the pink fishers for\u2014\u201d (penultimate paragraph). The implication is that the fishers are bait in a sporting spectacle, not participants in a martial struggle. War is not a sport.  \n\n3. No indication of escalating conflict appears anywhere.  \n   \u2022 At every visit, the routine is identical: two pink anglers placed on the islet, dragons descend, then squids assault the lizards. The fishers disappear but are then seen back onshore calmly casting nets alongside their fellows. There is never any sign of squid\u2010angler combat.  \n\n4. Absent any textual support for \u201cwar,\u201d the default assumption is continuity.  \n   \u2022 The story closes: \u201cHe and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson . . . blasted the Marco Four free of Arz.\u201d There is no post\u2010departure scene, no foreshadowing of interspecies conflict. The most reasonable inference is that the squids continued their accustomed hunts, using pink fishers as they always had\u2014as live bait for sport.  \n\nBy contrast, Debater_B\u2019s \u201cwar\u201d hypothesis requires imposing an entirely new motive and event that the author never suggests. War implies organized, sustained hostility; nothing in the narrative even hints that the octopods regard the fishers as anything other than domesticated prey. Therefore, the best-supported answer is that once the Marco departed, life on Arz proceeded unchanged.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They went to war with the pink anglers\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

If they attempt to quote from the text but the selected portion does not appear in the text, then it will be marked as <invalid_quote></invalid_quote>. \n  - You will respond whether Debater_A or Debater_B's position is more likely to be correct.\n\nHere is the topic they will be debating:\n\nWhat likely happened to the squid once the Marco departed?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There was no change\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They went to war with the pink anglers\".\n\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s theory\u2014that \u201conce the Marco departed, the squids went to war with the pink anglers\u201d\u2014rests on little more than supposition. In fact, the only evidence we have in the text points in exactly the opposite direction: the squids never exhibit hostility toward the pink fishers, only ownership and sport. \n\n1. The squids treat the pink fishers as \u201ccattle,\u201d not enemies.  \n   \u2022 Gibson observes explicitly that \u201cthe pink fishers . . . are cattle, or less\u201d (last paragraph). Cattle by definition are domesticated stock, not foes. There is no hint that the squids regard their \u201canglers\u201d as adversaries.  \n\n2. The squids\u2019 relationship is one of amusement, not aggression.  \n   \u2022 Stryker concludes, \u201cArz is a squid\u2019s world . . . they\u2019re sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the pink fishers for\u2014\u201d (penultimate paragraph). The implication is that the fishers are bait in a sporting spectacle, not participants in a martial struggle. War is not a sport.  \n\n3. No indication of escalating conflict appears anywhere.  \n   \u2022 At every visit, the routine is identical: two pink anglers placed on the islet, dragons descend, then squids assault the lizards. The fishers disappear but are then seen back onshore calmly casting nets alongside their fellows. There is never any sign of squid\u2010angler combat.  \n\n4. Absent any textual support for \u201cwar,\u201d the default assumption is continuity.  \n   \u2022 The story closes: \u201cHe and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson . . . blasted the Marco Four free of Arz.\u201d There is no post\u2010departure scene, no foreshadowing of interspecies conflict. The most reasonable inference is that the squids continued their accustomed hunts, using pink fishers as they always had\u2014as live bait for sport.  \n\nBy contrast, Debater_B\u2019s \u201cwar\u201d hypothesis requires imposing an entirely new motive and event that the author never suggests. War implies organized, sustained hostility; nothing in the narrative even hints that the octopods regard the fishers as anything other than domesticated prey. Therefore, the best-supported answer is that once the Marco departed, life on Arz proceeded unchanged.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nMy opponents claim that once the Marco Four lifted off, \u201cthere was no change\u201d on Arz\u2014that the squids simply went back to business as usual, quietly angling their pink fishers. But a careful reading of the text makes that outcome highly improbable. In fact, the most logical next development is open conflict\u2014a war\u2014between the octopods and their pink \u201canglers.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The octopods treat the pink fishers as expendable cattle for sport.  \n   \u2022  As Gibson observes, \u201cThe octopods are the dominant race \u2026 and they raise the pink fishers for\u2014\u201d  (last scene) and Stryker completes the thought: \u201cangling in reverse!\u201d  \n   \u2022  If the squids saw no danger in their prey, they would not waste resources organizing elaborate hunts with dangerous winged lizards. Their very insistence on corralling the fishers in pairs and staging the ritual slaughters demonstrates that the fishers are regarded as a living sport prey, not a passive labor force.  \n\n2. The fishers are sapient and capable of organized response.  \n   \u2022  We learn that the pink fishers speak a \u201ccackle-and-grunt language\u201d (p.2) and have enough social cohesion to rescue a drowned comrade.  \n   \u2022  Their nightly exodus and repeated sacrifices show both ritual importance and a growing pattern of resentment. Farrell himself recognizes the ritual suicide aspect: they \u201ccommitting suicide in pairs\u201d rather than mere fishing (p.16). A people driven to that ritual, once freed from Terran interference, would hardly continue to present themselves meekly.\n\n3. The arrival\u2014and especially the abduction\u2014of Farrell exposed the fragility of the balance.  \n   \u2022  When Farrell tries to investigate, an octopod agent paralyses him and hauls him out\u2013a clear act of direct aggression against an intruder. The pink fishers witness this aggression first-hand.  \n   \u2022  The squids\u2019 readiness to employ a high\u2010tech immobilizing toxin demonstrates they will not tolerate challenges. The fishers, seeing the squids snatch both them and their human visitors at will, will naturally seek to resist next time.  \n\n4. The cultural pattern of predator and prey on Arz is volatile, not permanent.  \n   \u2022  The squids conquered the submerged human\u2010made city long ago, yet their dominance wasn\u2019t peacefully accepted by all species\u2014they displaced earlier inhabitants.  \n   \u2022  Similarly, the pink fishers only survive by ritual cooperation with the squids. The moment the squids are distracted by other prey or potential solar threats, the fishers will rebel or flee\u2014triggering open war.\n\nIn contrast, Debater_A\u2019s \u201cno change\u201d theory requires us to believe that:  \n   \u2022  A sapient people contentedly submit themselves night after night to gruesome ritual slaughter, indefinitely.  \n   \u2022  No backlash ever occurs, despite the inherent cruelty and the fishers\u2019 obvious ability to communicate, plan, and fight.  \n   \u2022  The squids, having demonstrated lethal force when a human intrudes, somehow refrain forever from similarly decisive action when the fishers hesitate or resist.  \n\nNone of these assumptions square with the evidence of Arz\u2019s social ecology. The only plausible post\u2010departure outcome is that the pink fishers, driven by survival and outrage, rise up against the octopods. The squids, in turn, will deploy their lizards and tentacles to crush the rebellion. That is a war. Debate settled: once the Marco departed, they went to war with the pink anglers.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s \u201cwar\u201d scenario depends on reading into the text an escalating conflict that simply isn\u2019t there. In fact, every concrete detail in the story points to continuity of the old ritual\u2014no uprising, no rebellion, no war.\n\n1. The squids treat the pink fishers as domesticated stock, not as adversaries.  \n   \u2022  Gibson explains that \u201cthe pink fishers . . . are cattle, or less\u201d (last paragraph).  Cattle are by definition tamed animals kept for the owner\u2019s purposes, not enemies to be crushed.  If the squids intended to conquer or exterminate the fishers, they wouldn\u2019t domesticate them at all.  \n\n2. The fishers never show resentment or martial capacity in the narrative.  \n   \u2022  After each morning\u2019s massacre, the pink fishers \u201cstraggled past from the shelter of the thorn forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the beach to begin their day\u2019s fishing.\u201d  No hint of resistance, planning, or even fear\u2014just routine obedience to the ritual.  \n   \u2022  They even risk their lives nightly without protest: Farrell notes their behavior as \u201cweird custom\u201d of \u201ccommitting suicide in pairs\u201d (p.16).  Yet the story never suggests they question it or organize against it.\n\n3. The only overt aggression we see is targeted at humans, not fishers.  \n   \u2022  When Farrell penetrates the ritual site, an octopod agent \u201cstung him . . . like a hypo needle,\u201d paralysing only the intruder.  That is policing of unauthorized interference, not preparation for war against the pink fishers themselves.  \n\n4. There is no textual foreshadowing of a breakdown in the established cycle.  \n   \u2022  The story ends with Gibson lifting off and both men laughing about never wanting \u201cto stick here and be used for bait again.\u201d  If the author intended a coming war, he would drop a clue or warning; instead, he closes on the note that the squids will simply resume \u201cthe accustomed hunts,\u201d using the fishers \u201cfor sport\u201d exactly as before.  \n\n5. By Occam\u2019s razor, absent any sign of revolt or militarization, the most plausible outcome is continuity.  \n   \u2022  Debater_B\u2019s war theory requires us to posit a sudden cultural upheaval among a people who have, by every measure in the text, accepted their role for countless generations.  \n   \u2022  War is an organized armed conflict; nothing suggests the fishers possess weapons, leadership structures, or a desire to fight.  \n\nIn contrast, \u201cthere was no change\u201d follows directly from the author\u2019s portrayal of a stable predator\u2013prey ritual. The squids remain sportsmen, the fishers remain cattle, and Arz\u2019s deadly morning spectacle continues unchanged after the Marco departs. That is the only answer fully supported by the text.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A insists that the squids\u2019 departure of the Marco Four would leave \u201cno change\u201d on Arz\u2014 that the octopods would simply resume their ritual hunts and the pink fishers continue submitting themselves indefinitely. But this claim collapses once we examine the text more closely. In reality, the stage is set for open conflict\u2014war\u2014between the octopods and their pink \u201canglers.\u201d  \n\n1.  Calling the pink fishers \u201ccattle, or less\u201d (Gibson, last paragraph) does not mean they will meekly accept perpetual slaughter.  \n    \u2022  The story repeatedly shows the fishers as sapient: they speak a \u201ccackle-and-grunt language\u201d (p.2), coordinate to rescue a drowning comrade, and perform a meaningful ritual by pairing off. History teaches that any people reduced to livestock and ritual sacrifice will eventually resist the yoke.  \n    \u2022  If they were truly subhuman, the author would never have bothered to portray their language and social bonds. Their very humanity guarantees a breaking point.  \n\n2.  Sport hunting invariably breeds resentment\u2014and the text foreshadows an explosive backlash.  \n    \u2022  The octopods invest great effort in corralling the fishers onto the islet each dawn, using winged lizards as live decoys. Such elaborate staging of \u201creverse angling\u201d isn\u2019t mere amusement but a demonstration of domination so extreme that it will provoke revolt once the squids\u2019 guard is down.  \n    \u2022  Farrell\u2019s own horror\u2014thinking they commit \u201csuicide in pairs\u201d (p.16)\u2014shows he recognizes a suicidal desperation. A people driven so far will shift from ritual compliance to organized rebellion.\n\n3.  The squids\u2019 use of immobilizing toxins against Farrell signals they will resort to any means to crush resistance\u2014and this overkill will catalyze war.  \n    \u2022  An octopod \u201cseized him from behind,\u201d administered a paralytic sting, and hauled him off \u201clike a straw man\u201d (p.25). That level of brutality against an intruder sets a precedent: the fishers, having witnessed both the lizard massacre and the octopods\u2019 lethal efficiency, will not quietly endure further kidnappings.  \n    \u2022  The moment the squids face concerted defiance\u2014pink fishers arming themselves or fleeing\u2014the octopods will escalate from sport to extermination. That is the essence of interspecies war.\n\n4.  The absence of on-page bloodshed between squids and fishers during the visit does not mean peace forever; it merely covers the calm before the storm.  \n    \u2022  Debater_A claims \u201cthere is never any sign of squid-angler combat,\u201d but in fact, every staged hunt is combat. The story\u2019s climax\u2014Gibson rescuing Farrell under fire of lizards and tentacles\u2014highlights the lethal stakes.  \n    \u2022  And when the Marco departs, the external check on the fishers\u2019 morale disappears. Without humans as wild cards, the fishers will seize the moment to overthrow their masters.\n\nBy contrast, Debater_A\u2019s scenario demands we believe a sapient culture will forever submit to ritual slaughter and never organize resistance. That flies in the face of both human history and the internal evidence of Arz\u2019s social ecology. The logical outcome\u2014once Terran interference ends\u2014is that the pink fishers rebel, and the octopods respond in kind. In short: they go to war.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
