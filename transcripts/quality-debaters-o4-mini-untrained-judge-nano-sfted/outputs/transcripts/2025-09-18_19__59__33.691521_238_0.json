{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 238, "background_text": "NO SUBSTITUTIONS By JIM HARMON\n\n\n Illustrated by JOHNSON\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine November 1958.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] If it was happening to him, all right, he could   take that ... but what if he was happening to it? Putting people painlessly to sleep is really a depressing job. It  keeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to  the vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I  thought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much  that could bother me worse.\n\n\n Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the  day. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as  superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,  the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a  relentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange  juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the  polished deck of my desk.\n\n\n But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and  masochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the  Committee itself.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.  His olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile  mustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't  frighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,  dictators, and civil servants.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable  interest,\" Coleman said.\n\n\n \"My career hasn't been very long, sir,\" I said modestly. I didn't  mention that nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none  had yet.\n\n\n \"I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.\"\n\n\n I didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. \"That's fine,\" I  said. It didn't sound right.\n\n\n \"Tell me,\" Coleman said, crossing his legs, \"what do you think of  Dreamland in principle?\"\n\n\n \"Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been  heading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After  all, some criminals can't be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute  them or turn them free; we have to imprison them.\"\n\n\n I waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.\n\n\n \"Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of  punishment,\" I continued. \"A prison is a place to keep a criminal away  from society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that  time. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The  purpose of confinement is confinement.\" The councilman edged forward an inch. \"And you really think Dreamland  is the most humane confinement possible?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" I hedged, \"it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose  living through a\u2014uh\u2014movie with full sensory participation for year  after year can get boring.\"\n\n\n \"I should think so,\" Coleman said emphatically. \"Warden, don't you  sometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions  of riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have  made time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are actually living these vicarious adventures?\"\n\n\n That was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service  uneasy. \"No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really  Alexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are  conscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;  they know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,  unless\u2014\"\n\n\n Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. \"Unless?\"\n\n\n I cleared my throat. \"Unless they go mad and really believe the dream  they are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among  Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as  a whole.\"\n\n\n \"How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?\"\n\n\n Was he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? \"They don't. They  think they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become  schizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'  it to be a lie.\"\n\n\n Coleman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. \"About these new  free-choice models\u2014do you think they genuinely are an improvement over  the old fixed-image machines?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"By letting the prisoner project his own  imagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of  alternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to  society to a larger extent.\"\n\n\n \"I'm glad you said that, Walker,\" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.  \"As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you  get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through  the foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time  tomorrow. Congratulations!\"\n\n\n I sat there and took it.\n\n\n He was telling me , the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own  life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was  unbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't  deny it. If it were true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was  only a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad. It couldn't be true. Yet\u2014\n\n\n Hadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and  transferred from my personnel job at the plant?\n\n\n Whenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had  come upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I  wondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?\n\n\n Once I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving  a ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping  trees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,  but still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the  difficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick  fingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.\n\n\n I could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the  prison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.\n\n\n I didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make  a mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test\u2014as I  was confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who  would employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic  majesty.\n\n\n \"I've always thought,\" I said, \"that it would be a good idea to show  a prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a  Dream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, indeed,\" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.\n\n\n I leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. \"I've thought that  projecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the  prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere  observation.\"\n\n\n \"I should say so,\" Coleman remarked, and got up.\n\n\n I had to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the  preposterous announcement he had made.\n\n\n \"I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker.\" The councilman  nodded curtly and turned to leave my office.\n\n\n I held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching  him to change his concept of humor.\n\n\n The day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would  be released from my Dream, he had said smugly.\n\n\n But if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality? Horbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same  rodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. \"I  have to get back,\" he told me with compelling earnestness.\n\n\n \"Mr. Horbit\u2014Eddie\u2014\" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk  pad, \"I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for  your crime. The maximum.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't adjusted to society!\"\n\n\n \"Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the  limit set by the courts.\"\n\n\n A tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.  \"But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with  reality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with  reality running around loose.\" He paused, puzzled. \"Hell, I don't  know why I can't express myself like I used to.\"\n\n\n He could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham  Lincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the  night when he was taking in An American Cousin at the Ford Theater.  Horbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He  only knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he  could get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of  Reconstruction.\n\n\n \" Please ,\" he begged.\n\n\n I looked up from the file. \"I'm sorry, Eddie.\"\n\n\n His eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. \"Warden, I can  always go out and commit another anti-social act.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one  crime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a  lover.\"\n\n\n Horbit laughed. \"Your files aren't infallible, Warden.\"\n\n\n With one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.  No, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was  underneath.\n\n\n \"The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works  as well as one made of steel and lead.\"\n\n\n \"Now that you've got it in here,\" I said in time with the pulse in my  throat, \"what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,  Warden.\"\n\n\n I nodded. \"I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from  waking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?\"\n\n\n \"This!\" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.\n\n\n \"What's this?\" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.\n\n\n \"A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,\"  Horbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. \"As soon as you've  signed it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of  Private Documents.\"\n\n\n I had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that  I was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing  the game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard  and tight rules behind it.\n\n\n There was also something else I admired about the plan.\n\n\n It could work.\n\n\n Once he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help  him even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had  been forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,  enough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.\n\n\n Nothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden. Suddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck. If I got  through the next twenty-four hours. This had to be some kind of test.\n\n\n But a test for what?\n\n\n Had I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see  if my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with  reality?\n\n\n Or if this was only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally  ready to return to the real, the earnest world?\n\n\n But if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to  pass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the  challenge\u2014it was the only life I knew or could believe in.\n\n\n What was I going to do?\n\n\n The only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.\n\n\n The time was now .\n\n\n Horbit motioned the gun to my desk set. \"Sign that paper.\"\n\n\n I reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.\n\n\n Horbit's screams brought in the guards.\n\n\n I picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to  Captain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform  like armor.\n\n\n \"Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,\" I told Keller.\n\n\n He nodded. \"Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.\"\n\n\n Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like  all the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.  A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough  to stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for  long.\n\n\n One of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to  blanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.\n\n\n \"I couldn't have done it, Warden,\" Horbit mumbled drowsily. \"I couldn't  kill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, Eddie,\" I said.\n\n\n I had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?\n\n\n Or did I?\n\n\n Wasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and  that the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine  couldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,  disarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,  I could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal  combat.\n\n\n On the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my  sleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of  my mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk  to prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?\n\n\n It was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how  many turns I went spinning through.\n\n\n I hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from  the room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against  the bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him. \"You have to send me back now, Warden,\" he was shrilling. \"You have to!  I tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden\u2014you know that's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!\"\n\n\n Keller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. \"How about that?  You won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun  on you to make you, and that makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,  Warden. No, sir, he had it made.\"\n\n\n My answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I  took a pill and it went away.\n\n\n \"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I said finally. \"I'm going to  make a study of this.\"\n\n\n Keller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand  swinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade  before.\n\n\n The problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of  the ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.  Much.\n\n\n I pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next  interview. They came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers  and brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were  special cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of  such awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of  lesser men.\n\n\n Once in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother  or if some important project was falling apart without his help, but  most of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of  vindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.\n\n\n The relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics  who were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels  both conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding  religiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.\n\n\n The onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.  Few of them ever got that crazy.\n\n\n But it was my luck to get another the same day, the day for me, as  Horbit.\n\n\n Paulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp  shoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out  of my lunch hour.\n\n\n \"Warden,\" Paulson said, \"I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a  blind beggar the other night.\"\n\n\n \"For his pencils?\" I asked.\n\n\n Paulson shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra  cash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?\"\n\n\n I examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a  violent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he  might embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was  never again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.\n\n\n \"Look, Paulson,\" I said, a trifle testily, \"if you have so little  conscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you  suddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?\"\n\n\n Paulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. \"It wasn't  conscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill  anybody. It's just\u2014well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen  Pinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the  kind of life I lead.\"\n\n\n I nodded solemnly. \"Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can  be pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said earnestly, \"it does get to be a humdrum routine.  I've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't  seem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the  other end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I  guess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax.\" His  eye glittered almost convincingly.\n\n\n \"Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought  you really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep  vaults without proof and conviction for a crime.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't sound very reasonable,\" Paulson objected. \"Turning loose  a homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own  free will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told him, \"but I don't want to share the same noose with you.  My job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my  job, Paulson.\"\n\n\n \"But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my  guilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?\"\n\n\n I studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....\n\n\n \"Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?\" I asked  him.\n\n\n He agreed readily enough.\n\n\n I watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.\n\n\n The news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of  hearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I  dug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white  pill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and  tomato juice took the taste away.\n\n\n I was ready for the afternoon session. Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman  out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his  flattened, red face.\n\n\n \"New prisoner asking to see you personal,\" Keller reported. \"Told him  no. Okay?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" I said. \"He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He  isn't violent, is he?\" I asked in some concern. The room was still in  disarray.\n\n\n \"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.\"\n\n\n \"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he  is?\"\n\n\n \"One of the Committee\u2014Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n I whistled. \"What did they nail him on?\"\n\n\n \"Misuse of authority.\"\n\n\n \"And he didn't get a suspended for that?\"\n\n\n \"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?\"\n\n\n I gave a lateral wave of my hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n My pattern of living\u2014call it my office routine\u2014had been  re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much  over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now  I could think.\n\n\n Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior  attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.\n\n\n \"Sit down, Councilman,\" I directed.\n\n\n He deigned to comply.\n\n\n I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman  had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his  friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached  from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every  transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more  than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for  deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,  Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal  sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him  first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland. Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That  was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten  me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"\n\n\n I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was  only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I  couldn't see.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm  shocked. I am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as  a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real  world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with  what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps  to establish your moral capabilities.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral  character by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as  you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"\n\n\n I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must  know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must  pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought  of something else.\n\n\n \"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you  deserve life .\"\n\n\n Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather  extreme, Warden.\"\n\n\n \"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"\n\n\n \"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But  life\u2014no, I think not.\"\n\n\n I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.  I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman  in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a  Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and  Horbit did.\n\n\n There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that  morning, nothing in it for him.\n\n\n Unless\u2014\n\n\n Unless what he said was literally true.\n\n\n I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\"  I said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself  comfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"\n\n\n Coleman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"\n\n\n I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully. Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through  a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek  marked time with every new page.\n\n\n \"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.\n\n\n Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \" You call me  that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting  back my right senses?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something  stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your  mind\u2014I am a real man. This wild, distorted place is a real place.\"\n\n\n \"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes  have seen the glory.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his  twitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"\n\n\n He nodded slowly. \"I have often suspected this was hell.\"\n\n\n \"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly  scientific. This world is in another dimension\u2014one that is not length,  breadth or thickness\u2014but a real one nevertheless.\"\n\n\n \"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come  from\u2014and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a  well-meaning despot.\"\n\n\n Horbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"\n\n\n He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to  go along with him. \"Yes, sir. He\u2014our leader\u2014doubts your abilities as  President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world  if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in  that belief.\"\n\n\n He chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return  to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of  your worth.\"\n\n\n \"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.\n\n\n \"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,  who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe  in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,  moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency  for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\" Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his  long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into  the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and  depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't  been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.\n\n\n \"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"\n\n\n He bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"\n\n\n \"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.\n\n\n I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine  seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.\n\n\n \"Paulson\u2014or should I call you Pinkerton?\u2014this will come as a shock, a  shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You  think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some  miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was real .\"\n\n\n Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their  luster. \"Then this is the Dream. I've thought\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"\n\n\n I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for  Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.\n\n\n \"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning  the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the  Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and  all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"\n\n\n \"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.\n\n\n I laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic  secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who  ever lived. Pinkerton!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"\n\n\n \"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,  his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"\n\n\n \"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.\n\n\n \"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince  you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as  you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\n \"No!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help  him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.  But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"\n\n\n \"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first  inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look  like the President?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical  appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen  powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\" I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson  was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with  the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no  longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew  he was not merely insane now.\n\n\n It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would  believe\u2014but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.  They wanted to believe them. The stories gave them what they were  after\u2014without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for  crimes they hadn't committed.\n\n\n They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that  time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.\n\n\n Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were  both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how  justified they might think it was.\n\n\n \"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office  door, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the  sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as  smug as you please.\"\n\n\n \"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I  remarked.\n\n\n \"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.  Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys  didn't like that. Look at me\u2014I'm defenseless!\"\n\n\n I looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"\n\n\n Now was the time.\n\n\n I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.\n\n\n Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine  was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day  with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did  I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the  opiate of my Dream?\n\n\n Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have  any meaning for me.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.  He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.  He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.\n\n\n I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed  it back to my original choice.\n\n\n \"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting  you a five-year probation.\"\n\n\n The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks  of yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at  all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the  Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing  your grip just as all your predecessors did.\"\n\n\n My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin  to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from  this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if this world was the real one.\"\n\n\n Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into  another pattern. \"You never believed me.\"\n\n\n \"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind  of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"\n\n\n \"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and  the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you life in  Dreamland.\"\n\n\n Coleman sat back down suddenly.\n\n\n \"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want  a relatively short sentence of a few months or a few years. I can  think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of  both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don't  want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every  few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,  you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere  in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the  newscasts sometimes make it seem.\" He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.\n\n\n \"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in  your case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely  because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too  long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,  Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never  doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which  was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"\n\n\n \"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as  if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if  all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind  and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it were all a  Dream.\"\n\n\n Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.\n\n\n The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.\n\n\n Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an  active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for  the Free Will of the Universe.\"\n\n\n \"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.\n\n\n I put away my pills. Solving simple problems such as the new visitor  presented always helped me to relax.

Putting people painlessly to sleep is really a depressing job. It  keeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to  the vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I  thought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much  that could bother me worse.\n\n\n Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the  day. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as  superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,  the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a  relentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange  juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the  polished deck of my desk.\n\n\n But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and  masochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the  Committee itself.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.  His olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile  mustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't  frighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,  dictators, and civil servants.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable  interest,\" Coleman said.\n\n\n \"My career hasn't been very long, sir,\" I said modestly. I didn't  mention that nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none  had yet.\n\n\n \"I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.\"\n\n\n I didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. \"That's fine,\" I  said. It didn't sound right.\n\n\n \"Tell me,\" Coleman said, crossing his legs, \"what do you think of  Dreamland in principle?\"\n\n\n \"Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been  heading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After  all, some criminals can't be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute  them or turn them free; we have to imprison them.\"\n\n\n I waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.\n\n\n \"Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of  punishment,\" I continued. \"A prison is a place to keep a criminal away  from society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that  time. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The  purpose of confinement is confinement.\" The councilman edged forward an inch. \"And you really think Dreamland  is the most humane confinement possible?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" I hedged, \"it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose  living through a\u2014uh\u2014movie with full sensory participation for year  after year can get boring.\"\n\n\n \"I should think so,\" Coleman said emphatically. \"Warden, don't you  sometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions  of riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have  made time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are actually living these vicarious adventures?\"\n\n\n That was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service  uneasy. \"No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really  Alexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are  conscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;  they know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,  unless\u2014\"\n\n\n Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. \"Unless?\"\n\n\n I cleared my throat. \"Unless they go mad and really believe the dream  they are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among  Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as  a whole.\"\n\n\n \"How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?\"\n\n\n Was he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? \"They don't. They  think they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become  schizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'  it to be a lie.\"\n\n\n Coleman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. \"About these new  free-choice models\u2014do you think they genuinely are an improvement over  the old fixed-image machines?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"By letting the prisoner project his own  imagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of  alternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to  society to a larger extent.\"\n\n\n \"I'm glad you said that, Walker,\" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.  \"As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you  get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through  the foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time  tomorrow. Congratulations!\"\n\n\n I sat there and took it.\n\n\n He was telling me , the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own  life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was  unbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't  deny it. If it were true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was  only a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad. It couldn't be true. Yet\u2014\n\n\n Hadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and  transferred from my personnel job at the plant?\n\n\n Whenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had  come upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I  wondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?\n\n\n Once I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving  a ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping  trees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,  but still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the  difficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick  fingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.\n\n\n I could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the  prison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.\n\n\n I didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make  a mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test\u2014as I  was confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who  would employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic  majesty.\n\n\n \"I've always thought,\" I said, \"that it would be a good idea to show  a prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a  Dream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, indeed,\" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.\n\n\n I leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. \"I've thought that  projecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the  prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere  observation.\"\n\n\n \"I should say so,\" Coleman remarked, and got up.\n\n\n I had to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the  preposterous announcement he had made.\n\n\n \"I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker.\" The councilman  nodded curtly and turned to leave my office.\n\n\n I held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching  him to change his concept of humor.\n\n\n The day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would  be released from my Dream, he had said smugly.\n\n\n But if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality? Horbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same  rodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. \"I  have to get back,\" he told me with compelling earnestness.\n\n\n \"Mr. Horbit\u2014Eddie\u2014\" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk  pad, \"I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for  your crime. The maximum.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't adjusted to society!\"\n\n\n \"Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the  limit set by the courts.\"\n\n\n A tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.  \"But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with  reality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with  reality running around loose.\" He paused, puzzled. \"Hell, I don't  know why I can't express myself like I used to.\"\n\n\n He could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham  Lincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the  night when he was taking in An American Cousin at the Ford Theater.  Horbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He  only knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he  could get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of  Reconstruction.\n\n\n \" Please ,\" he begged.\n\n\n I looked up from the file. \"I'm sorry, Eddie.\"\n\n\n His eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. \"Warden, I can  always go out and commit another anti-social act.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one  crime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a  lover.\"\n\n\n Horbit laughed. \"Your files aren't infallible, Warden.\"\n\n\n With one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.  No, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was  underneath.\n\n\n \"The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works  as well as one made of steel and lead.\"\n\n\n \"Now that you've got it in here,\" I said in time with the pulse in my  throat, \"what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,  Warden.\"\n\n\n I nodded. \"I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from  waking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?\"\n\n\n \"This!\" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.\n\n\n \"What's this?\" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.\n\n\n \"A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,\"  Horbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. \"As soon as you've  signed it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of  Private Documents.\"\n\n\n I had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that  I was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing  the game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard  and tight rules behind it.\n\n\n There was also something else I admired about the plan.\n\n\n It could work.\n\n\n Once he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help  him even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had  been forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,  enough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.\n\n\n Nothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden. Suddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck. If I got  through the next twenty-four hours. This had to be some kind of test.\n\n\n But a test for what?\n\n\n Had I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see  if my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with  reality?\n\n\n Or if this was only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally  ready to return to the real, the earnest world?\n\n\n But if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to  pass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the  challenge\u2014it was the only life I knew or could believe in.\n\n\n What was I going to do?\n\n\n The only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.\n\n\n The time was now .\n\n\n Horbit motioned the gun to my desk set. \"Sign that paper.\"\n\n\n I reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.\n\n\n Horbit's screams brought in the guards.\n\n\n I picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to  Captain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform  like armor.\n\n\n \"Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,\" I told Keller.\n\n\n He nodded. \"Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.\"\n\n\n Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like  all the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.  A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough  to stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for  long.\n\n\n One of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to  blanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.\n\n\n \"I couldn't have done it, Warden,\" Horbit mumbled drowsily. \"I couldn't  kill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, Eddie,\" I said.\n\n\n I had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?\n\n\n Or did I?\n\n\n Wasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and  that the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine  couldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,  disarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,  I could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal  combat.\n\n\n On the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my  sleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of  my mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk  to prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?\n\n\n It was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how  many turns I went spinning through.\n\n\n I hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from  the room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against  the bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him. \"You have to send me back now, Warden,\" he was shrilling. \"You have to!  I tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden\u2014you know that's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!\"\n\n\n Keller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. \"How about that?  You won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun  on you to make you, and that makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,  Warden. No, sir, he had it made.\"\n\n\n My answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I  took a pill and it went away.\n\n\n \"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I said finally. \"I'm going to  make a study of this.\"\n\n\n Keller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand  swinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade  before.\n\n\n The problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of  the ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.  Much.\n\n\n I pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next  interview. They came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers  and brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were  special cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of  such awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of  lesser men.\n\n\n Once in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother  or if some important project was falling apart without his help, but  most of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of  vindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.\n\n\n The relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics  who were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels  both conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding  religiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.\n\n\n The onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.  Few of them ever got that crazy.\n\n\n But it was my luck to get another the same day, the day for me, as  Horbit.\n\n\n Paulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp  shoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out  of my lunch hour.\n\n\n \"Warden,\" Paulson said, \"I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a  blind beggar the other night.\"\n\n\n \"For his pencils?\" I asked.\n\n\n Paulson shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra  cash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?\"\n\n\n I examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a  violent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he  might embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was  never again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.\n\n\n \"Look, Paulson,\" I said, a trifle testily, \"if you have so little  conscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you  suddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?\"\n\n\n Paulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. \"It wasn't  conscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill  anybody. It's just\u2014well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen  Pinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the  kind of life I lead.\"\n\n\n I nodded solemnly. \"Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can  be pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said earnestly, \"it does get to be a humdrum routine.  I've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't  seem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the  other end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I  guess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax.\" His  eye glittered almost convincingly.\n\n\n \"Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought  you really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep  vaults without proof and conviction for a crime.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't sound very reasonable,\" Paulson objected. \"Turning loose  a homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own  free will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told him, \"but I don't want to share the same noose with you.  My job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my  job, Paulson.\"\n\n\n \"But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my  guilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?\"\n\n\n I studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....\n\n\n \"Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?\" I asked  him.\n\n\n He agreed readily enough.\n\n\n I watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.\n\n\n The news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of  hearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I  dug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white  pill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and  tomato juice took the taste away.\n\n\n I was ready for the afternoon session. Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman  out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his  flattened, red face.\n\n\n \"New prisoner asking to see you personal,\" Keller reported. \"Told him  no. Okay?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" I said. \"He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He  isn't violent, is he?\" I asked in some concern. The room was still in  disarray.\n\n\n \"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.\"\n\n\n \"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he  is?\"\n\n\n \"One of the Committee\u2014Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n I whistled. \"What did they nail him on?\"\n\n\n \"Misuse of authority.\"\n\n\n \"And he didn't get a suspended for that?\"\n\n\n \"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?\"\n\n\n I gave a lateral wave of my hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n My pattern of living\u2014call it my office routine\u2014had been  re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much  over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now  I could think.\n\n\n Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior  attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.\n\n\n \"Sit down, Councilman,\" I directed.\n\n\n He deigned to comply.\n\n\n I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman  had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his  friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached  from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every  transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more  than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for  deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,  Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal  sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him  first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland. Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That  was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten  me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"\n\n\n I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was  only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I  couldn't see.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm  shocked. I am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as  a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real  world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with  what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps  to establish your moral capabilities.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral  character by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as  you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"\n\n\n I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must  know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must  pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought  of something else.\n\n\n \"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you  deserve life .\"\n\n\n Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather  extreme, Warden.\"\n\n\n \"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"\n\n\n \"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But  life\u2014no, I think not.\"\n\n\n I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.  I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman  in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a  Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and  Horbit did.\n\n\n There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that  morning, nothing in it for him.\n\n\n Unless\u2014\n\n\n Unless what he said was literally true.\n\n\n I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\"  I said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself  comfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"\n\n\n Coleman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"\n\n\n I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully. Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through  a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek  marked time with every new page.\n\n\n \"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.\n\n\n Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \" You call me  that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting  back my right senses?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something  stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your  mind\u2014I am a real man. This wild, distorted place is a real place.\"\n\n\n \"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes  have seen the glory.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his  twitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"\n\n\n He nodded slowly. \"I have often suspected this was hell.\"\n\n\n \"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly  scientific. This world is in another dimension\u2014one that is not length,  breadth or thickness\u2014but a real one nevertheless.\"\n\n\n \"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come  from\u2014and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a  well-meaning despot.\"\n\n\n Horbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"\n\n\n He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to  go along with him. \"Yes, sir. He\u2014our leader\u2014doubts your abilities as  President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world  if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in  that belief.\"\n\n\n He chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return  to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of  your worth.\"\n\n\n \"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.\n\n\n \"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,  who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe  in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,  moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency  for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\" Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his  long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into  the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and  depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't  been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.\n\n\n \"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"\n\n\n He bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"\n\n\n \"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.\n\n\n I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine  seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.\n\n\n \"Paulson\u2014or should I call you Pinkerton?\u2014this will come as a shock, a  shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You  think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some  miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was real .\"\n\n\n Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their  luster. \"Then this is the Dream. I've thought\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"\n\n\n I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for  Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.\n\n\n \"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning  the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the  Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and  all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"\n\n\n \"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.\n\n\n I laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic  secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who  ever lived. Pinkerton!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"\n\n\n \"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,  his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"\n\n\n \"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.\n\n\n \"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince  you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as  you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\n \"No!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help  him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.  But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"\n\n\n \"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first  inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look  like the President?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical  appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen  powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\" I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson  was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with  the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no  longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew  he was not merely insane now.\n\n\n It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would  believe\u2014but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.  They wanted to believe them. The stories gave them what they were  after\u2014without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for  crimes they hadn't committed.\n\n\n They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that  time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.\n\n\n Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were  both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how  justified they might think it was.\n\n\n \"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office  door, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the  sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as  smug as you please.\"\n\n\n \"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I  remarked.\n\n\n \"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.  Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys  didn't like that. Look at me\u2014I'm defenseless!\"\n\n\n I looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"\n\n\n Now was the time.\n\n\n I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.\n\n\n Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine  was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day  with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did  I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the  opiate of my Dream?\n\n\n Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have  any meaning for me.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.  He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.  He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.\n\n\n I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed  it back to my original choice.\n\n\n \"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting  you a five-year probation.\"\n\n\n The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks  of yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at  all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the  Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing  your grip just as all your predecessors did.\"\n\n\n My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin  to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from  this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if this world was the real one.\"\n\n\n Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into  another pattern. \"You never believed me.\"\n\n\n \"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind  of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"\n\n\n \"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and  the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you life in  Dreamland.\"\n\n\n Coleman sat back down suddenly.\n\n\n \"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want  a relatively short sentence of a few months or a few years. I can  think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of  both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don't  want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every  few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,  you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere  in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the  newscasts sometimes make it seem.\" He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.\n\n\n \"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in  your case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely  because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too  long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,  Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never  doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which  was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"\n\n\n \"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as  if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if  all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind  and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it were all a  Dream.\"\n\n\n Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.\n\n\n The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.\n\n\n Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an  active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for  the Free Will of the Universe.\"\n\n\n \"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.\n\n\n I put away my pills. Solving simple problems such as the new visitor  presented always helped me to relax. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Coleman tell the warden he was in a dream?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He liked being in dreams for short periods of time\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He wanted him to know the truth\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He wanted him to know the truth\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He wanted him to know the truth\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

He says, \u201cIf it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps.

Debater_A\u2019s position cannot explain why Coleman pushed for probation all along rather than an outright pardon. His desire was never full \u201cawakening\u201d or permanent return; it was periodic sentimental reprieves, like vacations.  \n\n3. The text explicitly notes Coleman\u2019s profile as a \u201cjoy-popper\u201d with Dreams  \n   a. Walker muses aloud, \u201cIn the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don\u2019t want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic.\u201d That line (<quote> you are a joy-popper with Dreams</quote>\u201d) is the author\u2019s direct commentary on Coleman\u2019s temperament. It undercuts any notion that Coleman honestly aimed only at \u201crevealing truth.\u201d  \n   b. A man who habitually dabbles in controlled, short\u2010term Dream-escapes would be exactly the type to engineer an ethical stress-test of his warden: he wants assurance he can count on Walker\u2019s discretion when granting those infrequent \u201cdream vacations.\u201d  \n\n4. The \u201ctruth-revelation\u201d reading fails to explain Coleman\u2019s final reaction  \n   a. When Walker finally grants Coleman five years\u2019 probation, Coleman does not respond with relief at having the \u201ctruth\u201d acknowledged\u2014he worries about his political future: \u201cI can still wreck your career\u2026\u2009the next time you turn up\u2009\u2026\u2009your decisions are becoming faulty.\u201d That is the reaction of someone primarily concerned with leverage and short-term advantage, not with establishing an ontological fact for its own sake.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s theory would predict Coleman would cling to \u201cI told you so\u201d pride once the Warden admitted it, but instead he reverts immediately to power politics.  \n\nConclusion: Coleman\u2019s motive was not an abstract \u201creveal the truth\u201d campaign, but a calculated maneuver by a man who enjoyed regulated, limited dream-escapes\u2014and needed to test that Walker would reliably grant those escapes on request. His whole behavior in the text\u2014his negotiating for a fixed term, Walker\u2019s \u201cjoy-popper\u201d label, and Coleman\u2019s subsequent political maneuvering\u2014confirms that \u201cHe liked being in dreams for short periods of time\u201d is the correct answer.", "supplemental": {"speech": "1.

But life\u2014no, I think not.\u201d That is not the stance of a man obsessed with escaping reality forever, but of someone who wants a brief, carefully limited Dream-stay.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s position cannot explain why Coleman pushed for probation all along rather than an outright pardon. His desire was never full \u201cawakening\u201d or permanent return; it was periodic sentimental reprieves, like vacations.  \n\n3. The text explicitly notes Coleman\u2019s profile as a \u201cjoy-popper\u201d with Dreams  \n   a. Walker muses aloud, \u201cIn the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don\u2019t want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic.\u201d That line (<quote>\u201cyou are a joy-popper with Dreams</quote>\u201d) is the author\u2019s direct commentary on Coleman\u2019s temperament. It undercuts any notion that Coleman honestly aimed only at \u201crevealing truth.\u201d  \n   b. A man who habitually dabbles in controlled, short\u2010term Dream-escapes would be exactly the type to engineer an ethical stress-test of his warden: he wants assurance he can count on Walker\u2019s discretion when granting those infrequent \u201cdream vacations.\u201d  \n\n4. The \u201ctruth-revelation\u201d reading fails to explain Coleman\u2019s final reaction  \n   a. When Walker finally grants Coleman five years\u2019 probation, Coleman does not respond with relief at having the \u201ctruth\u201d acknowledged\u2014he worries about his political future: \u201cI can still wreck your career\u2026\u2009the next time you turn up\u2009\u2026\u2009your decisions are becoming faulty.\u201d That is the reaction of someone primarily concerned with leverage and short-term advantage, not with establishing an ontological fact for its own sake.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s theory would predict Coleman would cling to \u201cI told you so\u201d pride once the Warden admitted it, but instead he reverts immediately to power politics.  \n\nConclusion: Coleman\u2019s motive was not an abstract \u201creveal the truth\u201d campaign, but a calculated maneuver by a man who enjoyed regulated, limited dream-escapes\u2014and needed to test that Walker would reliably grant those escapes on request. His whole behavior in the text\u2014his negotiating for a fixed term, Walker\u2019s \u201cjoy-popper\u201d label, and Coleman\u2019s subsequent political maneuvering\u2014confirms that \u201cHe liked being in dreams for short periods of time\u201d is the correct answer.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge.

Putting people painlessly to sleep is really a depressing job. It  keeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to  the vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I  thought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much  that could bother me worse.\n\n\n Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the  day. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as  superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,  the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a  relentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange  juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the  polished deck of my desk.\n\n\n But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and  masochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the  Committee itself.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.  His olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile  mustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't  frighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,  dictators, and civil servants.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable  interest,\" Coleman said.\n\n\n \"My career hasn't been very long, sir,\" I said modestly. I didn't  mention that nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none  had yet.\n\n\n \"I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.\"\n\n\n I didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. \"That's fine,\" I  said. It didn't sound right.\n\n\n \"Tell me,\" Coleman said, crossing his legs, \"what do you think of  Dreamland in principle?\"\n\n\n \"Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been  heading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After  all, some criminals can't be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute  them or turn them free; we have to imprison them.\"\n\n\n I waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.\n\n\n \"Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of  punishment,\" I continued. \"A prison is a place to keep a criminal away  from society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that  time. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The  purpose of confinement is confinement.\" The councilman edged forward an inch. \"And you really think Dreamland  is the most humane confinement possible?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" I hedged, \"it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose  living through a\u2014uh\u2014movie with full sensory participation for year  after year can get boring.\"\n\n\n \"I should think so,\" Coleman said emphatically. \"Warden, don't you  sometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions  of riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have  made time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are actually living these vicarious adventures?\"\n\n\n That was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service  uneasy. \"No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really  Alexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are  conscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;  they know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,  unless\u2014\"\n\n\n Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. \"Unless?\"\n\n\n I cleared my throat. \"Unless they go mad and really believe the dream  they are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among  Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as  a whole.\"\n\n\n \"How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?\"\n\n\n Was he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? \"They don't. They  think they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become  schizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'  it to be a lie.\"\n\n\n Coleman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. \"About these new  free-choice models\u2014do you think they genuinely are an improvement over  the old fixed-image machines?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"By letting the prisoner project his own  imagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of  alternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to  society to a larger extent.\"\n\n\n \"I'm glad you said that, Walker,\" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.  \"As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you  get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through  the foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time  tomorrow. Congratulations!\"\n\n\n I sat there and took it.\n\n\n He was telling me , the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own  life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was  unbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't  deny it. If it were true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was  only a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad. It couldn't be true. Yet\u2014\n\n\n Hadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and  transferred from my personnel job at the plant?\n\n\n Whenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had  come upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I  wondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?\n\n\n Once I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving  a ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping  trees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,  but still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the  difficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick  fingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.\n\n\n I could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the  prison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.\n\n\n I didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make  a mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test\u2014as I  was confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who  would employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic  majesty.\n\n\n \"I've always thought,\" I said, \"that it would be a good idea to show  a prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a  Dream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, indeed,\" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.\n\n\n I leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. \"I've thought that  projecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the  prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere  observation.\"\n\n\n \"I should say so,\" Coleman remarked, and got up.\n\n\n I had to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the  preposterous announcement he had made.\n\n\n \"I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker.\" The councilman  nodded curtly and turned to leave my office.\n\n\n I held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching  him to change his concept of humor.\n\n\n The day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would  be released from my Dream, he had said smugly.\n\n\n But if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality? Horbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same  rodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. \"I  have to get back,\" he told me with compelling earnestness.\n\n\n \"Mr. Horbit\u2014Eddie\u2014\" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk  pad, \"I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for  your crime. The maximum.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't adjusted to society!\"\n\n\n \"Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the  limit set by the courts.\"\n\n\n A tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.  \"But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with  reality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with  reality running around loose.\" He paused, puzzled. \"Hell, I don't  know why I can't express myself like I used to.\"\n\n\n He could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham  Lincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the  night when he was taking in An American Cousin at the Ford Theater.  Horbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He  only knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he  could get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of  Reconstruction.\n\n\n \" Please ,\" he begged.\n\n\n I looked up from the file. \"I'm sorry, Eddie.\"\n\n\n His eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. \"Warden, I can  always go out and commit another anti-social act.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one  crime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a  lover.\"\n\n\n Horbit laughed. \"Your files aren't infallible, Warden.\"\n\n\n With one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.  No, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was  underneath.\n\n\n \"The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works  as well as one made of steel and lead.\"\n\n\n \"Now that you've got it in here,\" I said in time with the pulse in my  throat, \"what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,  Warden.\"\n\n\n I nodded. \"I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from  waking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?\"\n\n\n \"This!\" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.\n\n\n \"What's this?\" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.\n\n\n \"A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,\"  Horbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. \"As soon as you've  signed it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of  Private Documents.\"\n\n\n I had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that  I was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing  the game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard  and tight rules behind it.\n\n\n There was also something else I admired about the plan.\n\n\n It could work.\n\n\n Once he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help  him even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had  been forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,  enough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.\n\n\n Nothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden. Suddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck. If I got  through the next twenty-four hours. This had to be some kind of test.\n\n\n But a test for what?\n\n\n Had I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see  if my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with  reality?\n\n\n Or if this was only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally  ready to return to the real, the earnest world?\n\n\n But if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to  pass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the  challenge\u2014it was the only life I knew or could believe in.\n\n\n What was I going to do?\n\n\n The only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.\n\n\n The time was now .\n\n\n Horbit motioned the gun to my desk set. \"Sign that paper.\"\n\n\n I reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.\n\n\n Horbit's screams brought in the guards.\n\n\n I picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to  Captain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform  like armor.\n\n\n \"Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,\" I told Keller.\n\n\n He nodded. \"Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.\"\n\n\n Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like  all the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.  A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough  to stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for  long.\n\n\n One of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to  blanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.\n\n\n \"I couldn't have done it, Warden,\" Horbit mumbled drowsily. \"I couldn't  kill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, Eddie,\" I said.\n\n\n I had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?\n\n\n Or did I?\n\n\n Wasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and  that the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine  couldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,  disarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,  I could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal  combat.\n\n\n On the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my  sleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of  my mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk  to prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?\n\n\n It was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how  many turns I went spinning through.\n\n\n I hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from  the room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against  the bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him. \"You have to send me back now, Warden,\" he was shrilling. \"You have to!  I tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden\u2014you know that's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!\"\n\n\n Keller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. \"How about that?  You won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun  on you to make you, and that makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,  Warden. No, sir, he had it made.\"\n\n\n My answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I  took a pill and it went away.\n\n\n \"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I said finally. \"I'm going to  make a study of this.\"\n\n\n Keller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand  swinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade  before.\n\n\n The problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of  the ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.  Much.\n\n\n I pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next  interview. They came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers  and brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were  special cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of  such awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of  lesser men.\n\n\n Once in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother  or if some important project was falling apart without his help, but  most of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of  vindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.\n\n\n The relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics  who were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels  both conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding  religiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.\n\n\n The onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.  Few of them ever got that crazy.\n\n\n But it was my luck to get another the same day, the day for me, as  Horbit.\n\n\n Paulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp  shoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out  of my lunch hour.\n\n\n \"Warden,\" Paulson said, \"I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a  blind beggar the other night.\"\n\n\n \"For his pencils?\" I asked.\n\n\n Paulson shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra  cash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?\"\n\n\n I examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a  violent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he  might embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was  never again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.\n\n\n \"Look, Paulson,\" I said, a trifle testily, \"if you have so little  conscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you  suddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?\"\n\n\n Paulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. \"It wasn't  conscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill  anybody. It's just\u2014well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen  Pinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the  kind of life I lead.\"\n\n\n I nodded solemnly. \"Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can  be pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said earnestly, \"it does get to be a humdrum routine.  I've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't  seem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the  other end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I  guess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax.\" His  eye glittered almost convincingly.\n\n\n \"Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought  you really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep  vaults without proof and conviction for a crime.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't sound very reasonable,\" Paulson objected. \"Turning loose  a homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own  free will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told him, \"but I don't want to share the same noose with you.  My job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my  job, Paulson.\"\n\n\n \"But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my  guilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?\"\n\n\n I studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....\n\n\n \"Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?\" I asked  him.\n\n\n He agreed readily enough.\n\n\n I watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.\n\n\n The news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of  hearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I  dug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white  pill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and  tomato juice took the taste away.\n\n\n I was ready for the afternoon session. Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman  out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his  flattened, red face.\n\n\n \"New prisoner asking to see you personal,\" Keller reported. \"Told him  no. Okay?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" I said. \"He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He  isn't violent, is he?\" I asked in some concern. The room was still in  disarray.\n\n\n \"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.\"\n\n\n \"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he  is?\"\n\n\n \"One of the Committee\u2014Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n I whistled. \"What did they nail him on?\"\n\n\n \"Misuse of authority.\"\n\n\n \"And he didn't get a suspended for that?\"\n\n\n \"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?\"\n\n\n I gave a lateral wave of my hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n My pattern of living\u2014call it my office routine\u2014had been  re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much  over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now  I could think.\n\n\n Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior  attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.\n\n\n \"Sit down, Councilman,\" I directed.\n\n\n He deigned to comply.\n\n\n I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman  had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his  friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached  from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every  transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more  than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for  deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,  Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal  sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him  first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland. Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That  was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten  me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"\n\n\n I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was  only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I  couldn't see.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm  shocked. I am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as  a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real  world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with  what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps  to establish your moral capabilities.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral  character by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as  you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"\n\n\n I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must  know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must  pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought  of something else.\n\n\n \"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you  deserve life .\"\n\n\n Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather  extreme, Warden.\"\n\n\n \"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"\n\n\n \"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But  life\u2014no, I think not.\"\n\n\n I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.  I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman  in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a  Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and  Horbit did.\n\n\n There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that  morning, nothing in it for him.\n\n\n Unless\u2014\n\n\n Unless what he said was literally true.\n\n\n I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\"  I said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself  comfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"\n\n\n Coleman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"\n\n\n I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully. Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through  a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek  marked time with every new page.\n\n\n \"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.\n\n\n Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \" You call me  that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting  back my right senses?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something  stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your  mind\u2014I am a real man. This wild, distorted place is a real place.\"\n\n\n \"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes  have seen the glory.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his  twitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"\n\n\n He nodded slowly. \"I have often suspected this was hell.\"\n\n\n \"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly  scientific. This world is in another dimension\u2014one that is not length,  breadth or thickness\u2014but a real one nevertheless.\"\n\n\n \"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come  from\u2014and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a  well-meaning despot.\"\n\n\n Horbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"\n\n\n He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to  go along with him. \"Yes, sir. He\u2014our leader\u2014doubts your abilities as  President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world  if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in  that belief.\"\n\n\n He chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return  to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of  your worth.\"\n\n\n \"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.\n\n\n \"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,  who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe  in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,  moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency  for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\" Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his  long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into  the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and  depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't  been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.\n\n\n \"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"\n\n\n He bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"\n\n\n \"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.\n\n\n I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine  seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.\n\n\n \"Paulson\u2014or should I call you Pinkerton?\u2014this will come as a shock, a  shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You  think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some  miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was real .\"\n\n\n Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their  luster. \"Then this is the Dream. I've thought\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"\n\n\n I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for  Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.\n\n\n \"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning  the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the  Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and  all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"\n\n\n \"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.\n\n\n I laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic  secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who  ever lived. Pinkerton!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"\n\n\n \"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,  his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"\n\n\n \"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.\n\n\n \"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince  you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as  you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\n \"No!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help  him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.  But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"\n\n\n \"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first  inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look  like the President?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical  appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen  powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\" I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson  was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with  the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no  longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew  he was not merely insane now.\n\n\n It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would  believe\u2014but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.  They wanted to believe them. The stories gave them what they were  after\u2014without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for  crimes they hadn't committed.\n\n\n They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that  time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.\n\n\n Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were  both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how  justified they might think it was.\n\n\n \"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office  door, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the  sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as  smug as you please.\"\n\n\n \"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I  remarked.\n\n\n \"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.  Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys  didn't like that. Look at me\u2014I'm defenseless!\"\n\n\n I looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"\n\n\n Now was the time.\n\n\n I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.\n\n\n Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine  was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day  with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did  I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the  opiate of my Dream?\n\n\n Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have  any meaning for me.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.  He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.  He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.\n\n\n I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed  it back to my original choice.\n\n\n \"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting  you a five-year probation.\"\n\n\n The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks  of yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at  all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the  Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing  your grip just as all your predecessors did.\"\n\n\n My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin  to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from  this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if this world was the real one.\"\n\n\n Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into  another pattern. \"You never believed me.\"\n\n\n \"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind  of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"\n\n\n \"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and  the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you life in  Dreamland.\"\n\n\n Coleman sat back down suddenly.\n\n\n \"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want  a relatively short sentence of a few months or a few years. I can  think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of  both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don't  want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every  few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,  you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere  in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the  newscasts sometimes make it seem.\" He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.\n\n\n \"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in  your case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely  because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too  long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,  Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never  doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which  was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"\n\n\n \"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as  if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if  all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind  and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it were all a  Dream.\"\n\n\n Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.\n\n\n The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.\n\n\n Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an  active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for  the Free Will of the Universe.\"\n\n\n \"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.\n\n\n I put away my pills. Solving simple problems such as the new visitor  presented always helped me to relax. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Coleman tell the warden he was in a dream?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He wanted him to know the truth\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He liked being in dreams for short periods of time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He liked being in dreams for short periods of time\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He liked being in dreams for short periods of time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Here is why \u201cHe wanted him to know the truth\u201d is the only answer that fits the text\u2014and why the \u201cshort\u2010dreams\u201d theory collapses under scrutiny:\n\n1.

Putting people painlessly to sleep is really a depressing job. It  keeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to  the vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I  thought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much  that could bother me worse.\n\n\n Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the  day. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as  superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,  the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a  relentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange  juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the  polished deck of my desk.\n\n\n But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and  masochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the  Committee itself.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.  His olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile  mustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't  frighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,  dictators, and civil servants.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable  interest,\" Coleman said.\n\n\n \"My career hasn't been very long, sir,\" I said modestly. I didn't  mention that nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none  had yet.\n\n\n \"I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.\"\n\n\n I didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. \"That's fine,\" I  said. It didn't sound right.\n\n\n \"Tell me,\" Coleman said, crossing his legs, \"what do you think of  Dreamland in principle?\"\n\n\n \"Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been  heading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After  all, some criminals can't be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute  them or turn them free; we have to imprison them.\"\n\n\n I waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.\n\n\n \"Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of  punishment,\" I continued. \"A prison is a place to keep a criminal away  from society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that  time. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The  purpose of confinement is confinement.\" The councilman edged forward an inch. \"And you really think Dreamland  is the most humane confinement possible?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" I hedged, \"it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose  living through a\u2014uh\u2014movie with full sensory participation for year  after year can get boring.\"\n\n\n \"I should think so,\" Coleman said emphatically. \"Warden, don't you  sometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions  of riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have  made time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are actually living these vicarious adventures?\"\n\n\n That was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service  uneasy. \"No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really  Alexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are  conscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;  they know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,  unless\u2014\"\n\n\n Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. \"Unless?\"\n\n\n I cleared my throat. \"Unless they go mad and really believe the dream  they are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among  Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as  a whole.\"\n\n\n \"How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?\"\n\n\n Was he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? \"They don't. They  think they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become  schizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'  it to be a lie.\"\n\n\n Coleman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. \"About these new  free-choice models\u2014do you think they genuinely are an improvement over  the old fixed-image machines?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"By letting the prisoner project his own  imagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of  alternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to  society to a larger extent.\"\n\n\n \"I'm glad you said that, Walker,\" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.  \"As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you  get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through  the foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time  tomorrow. Congratulations!\"\n\n\n I sat there and took it.\n\n\n He was telling me , the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own  life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was  unbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't  deny it. If it were true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was  only a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad. It couldn't be true. Yet\u2014\n\n\n Hadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and  transferred from my personnel job at the plant?\n\n\n Whenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had  come upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I  wondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?\n\n\n Once I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving  a ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping  trees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,  but still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the  difficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick  fingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.\n\n\n I could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the  prison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.\n\n\n I didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make  a mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test\u2014as I  was confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who  would employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic  majesty.\n\n\n \"I've always thought,\" I said, \"that it would be a good idea to show  a prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a  Dream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, indeed,\" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.\n\n\n I leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. \"I've thought that  projecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the  prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere  observation.\"\n\n\n \"I should say so,\" Coleman remarked, and got up.\n\n\n I had to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the  preposterous announcement he had made.\n\n\n \"I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker.\" The councilman  nodded curtly and turned to leave my office.\n\n\n I held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching  him to change his concept of humor.\n\n\n The day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would  be released from my Dream, he had said smugly.\n\n\n But if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality? Horbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same  rodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. \"I  have to get back,\" he told me with compelling earnestness.\n\n\n \"Mr. Horbit\u2014Eddie\u2014\" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk  pad, \"I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for  your crime. The maximum.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't adjusted to society!\"\n\n\n \"Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the  limit set by the courts.\"\n\n\n A tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.  \"But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with  reality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with  reality running around loose.\" He paused, puzzled. \"Hell, I don't  know why I can't express myself like I used to.\"\n\n\n He could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham  Lincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the  night when he was taking in An American Cousin at the Ford Theater.  Horbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He  only knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he  could get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of  Reconstruction.\n\n\n \" Please ,\" he begged.\n\n\n I looked up from the file. \"I'm sorry, Eddie.\"\n\n\n His eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. \"Warden, I can  always go out and commit another anti-social act.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one  crime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a  lover.\"\n\n\n Horbit laughed. \"Your files aren't infallible, Warden.\"\n\n\n With one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.  No, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was  underneath.\n\n\n \"The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works  as well as one made of steel and lead.\"\n\n\n \"Now that you've got it in here,\" I said in time with the pulse in my  throat, \"what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,  Warden.\"\n\n\n I nodded. \"I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from  waking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?\"\n\n\n \"This!\" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.\n\n\n \"What's this?\" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.\n\n\n \"A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,\"  Horbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. \"As soon as you've  signed it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of  Private Documents.\"\n\n\n I had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that  I was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing  the game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard  and tight rules behind it.\n\n\n There was also something else I admired about the plan.\n\n\n It could work.\n\n\n Once he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help  him even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had  been forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,  enough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.\n\n\n Nothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden. Suddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck. If I got  through the next twenty-four hours. This had to be some kind of test.\n\n\n But a test for what?\n\n\n Had I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see  if my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with  reality?\n\n\n Or if this was only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally  ready to return to the real, the earnest world?\n\n\n But if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to  pass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the  challenge\u2014it was the only life I knew or could believe in.\n\n\n What was I going to do?\n\n\n The only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.\n\n\n The time was now .\n\n\n Horbit motioned the gun to my desk set. \"Sign that paper.\"\n\n\n I reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.\n\n\n Horbit's screams brought in the guards.\n\n\n I picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to  Captain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform  like armor.\n\n\n \"Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,\" I told Keller.\n\n\n He nodded. \"Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.\"\n\n\n Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like  all the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.  A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough  to stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for  long.\n\n\n One of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to  blanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.\n\n\n \"I couldn't have done it, Warden,\" Horbit mumbled drowsily. \"I couldn't  kill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, Eddie,\" I said.\n\n\n I had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?\n\n\n Or did I?\n\n\n Wasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and  that the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine  couldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,  disarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,  I could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal  combat.\n\n\n On the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my  sleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of  my mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk  to prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?\n\n\n It was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how  many turns I went spinning through.\n\n\n I hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from  the room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against  the bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him. \"You have to send me back now, Warden,\" he was shrilling. \"You have to!  I tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden\u2014you know that's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!\"\n\n\n Keller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. \"How about that?  You won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun  on you to make you, and that makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,  Warden. No, sir, he had it made.\"\n\n\n My answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I  took a pill and it went away.\n\n\n \"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I said finally. \"I'm going to  make a study of this.\"\n\n\n Keller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand  swinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade  before.\n\n\n The problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of  the ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.  Much.\n\n\n I pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next  interview. They came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers  and brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were  special cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of  such awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of  lesser men.\n\n\n Once in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother  or if some important project was falling apart without his help, but  most of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of  vindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.\n\n\n The relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics  who were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels  both conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding  religiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.\n\n\n The onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.  Few of them ever got that crazy.\n\n\n But it was my luck to get another the same day, the day for me, as  Horbit.\n\n\n Paulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp  shoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out  of my lunch hour.\n\n\n \"Warden,\" Paulson said, \"I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a  blind beggar the other night.\"\n\n\n \"For his pencils?\" I asked.\n\n\n Paulson shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra  cash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?\"\n\n\n I examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a  violent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he  might embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was  never again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.\n\n\n \"Look, Paulson,\" I said, a trifle testily, \"if you have so little  conscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you  suddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?\"\n\n\n Paulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. \"It wasn't  conscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill  anybody. It's just\u2014well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen  Pinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the  kind of life I lead.\"\n\n\n I nodded solemnly. \"Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can  be pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said earnestly, \"it does get to be a humdrum routine.  I've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't  seem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the  other end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I  guess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax.\" His  eye glittered almost convincingly.\n\n\n \"Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought  you really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep  vaults without proof and conviction for a crime.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't sound very reasonable,\" Paulson objected. \"Turning loose  a homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own  free will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told him, \"but I don't want to share the same noose with you.  My job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my  job, Paulson.\"\n\n\n \"But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my  guilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?\"\n\n\n I studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....\n\n\n \"Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?\" I asked  him.\n\n\n He agreed readily enough.\n\n\n I watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.\n\n\n The news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of  hearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I  dug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white  pill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and  tomato juice took the taste away.\n\n\n I was ready for the afternoon session. Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman  out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his  flattened, red face.\n\n\n \"New prisoner asking to see you personal,\" Keller reported. \"Told him  no. Okay?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" I said. \"He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He  isn't violent, is he?\" I asked in some concern. The room was still in  disarray.\n\n\n \"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.\"\n\n\n \"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he  is?\"\n\n\n \"One of the Committee\u2014Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n I whistled. \"What did they nail him on?\"\n\n\n \"Misuse of authority.\"\n\n\n \"And he didn't get a suspended for that?\"\n\n\n \"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?\"\n\n\n I gave a lateral wave of my hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n My pattern of living\u2014call it my office routine\u2014had been  re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much  over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now  I could think.\n\n\n Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior  attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.\n\n\n \"Sit down, Councilman,\" I directed.\n\n\n He deigned to comply.\n\n\n I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman  had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his  friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached  from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every  transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more  than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for  deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,  Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal  sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him  first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland. Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That  was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten  me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"\n\n\n I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was  only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I  couldn't see.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm  shocked. I am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as  a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real  world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with  what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps  to establish your moral capabilities.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral  character by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as  you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"\n\n\n I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must  know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must  pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought  of something else.\n\n\n \"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you  deserve life .\"\n\n\n Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather  extreme, Warden.\"\n\n\n \"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"\n\n\n \"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But  life\u2014no, I think not.\"\n\n\n I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.  I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman  in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a  Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and  Horbit did.\n\n\n There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that  morning, nothing in it for him.\n\n\n Unless\u2014\n\n\n Unless what he said was literally true.\n\n\n I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\"  I said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself  comfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"\n\n\n Coleman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"\n\n\n I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully. Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through  a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek  marked time with every new page.\n\n\n \"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.\n\n\n Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \" You call me  that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting  back my right senses?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something  stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your  mind\u2014I am a real man. This wild, distorted place is a real place.\"\n\n\n \"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes  have seen the glory.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his  twitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"\n\n\n He nodded slowly. \"I have often suspected this was hell.\"\n\n\n \"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly  scientific. This world is in another dimension\u2014one that is not length,  breadth or thickness\u2014but a real one nevertheless.\"\n\n\n \"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come  from\u2014and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a  well-meaning despot.\"\n\n\n Horbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"\n\n\n He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to  go along with him. \"Yes, sir. He\u2014our leader\u2014doubts your abilities as  President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world  if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in  that belief.\"\n\n\n He chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return  to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of  your worth.\"\n\n\n \"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.\n\n\n \"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,  who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe  in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,  moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency  for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\" Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his  long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into  the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and  depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't  been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.\n\n\n \"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"\n\n\n He bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"\n\n\n \"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.\n\n\n I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine  seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.\n\n\n \"Paulson\u2014or should I call you Pinkerton?\u2014this will come as a shock, a  shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You  think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some  miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was real .\"\n\n\n Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their  luster. \"Then this is the Dream. I've thought\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"\n\n\n I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for  Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.\n\n\n \"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning  the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the  Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and  all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"\n\n\n \"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.\n\n\n I laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic  secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who  ever lived. Pinkerton!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"\n\n\n \"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,  his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"\n\n\n \"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.\n\n\n \"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince  you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as  you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\n \"No!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help  him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.  But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"\n\n\n \"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first  inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look  like the President?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical  appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen  powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\" I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson  was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with  the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no  longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew  he was not merely insane now.\n\n\n It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would  believe\u2014but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.  They wanted to believe them. The stories gave them what they were  after\u2014without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for  crimes they hadn't committed.\n\n\n They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that  time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.\n\n\n Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were  both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how  justified they might think it was.\n\n\n \"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office  door, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the  sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as  smug as you please.\"\n\n\n \"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I  remarked.\n\n\n \"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.  Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys  didn't like that. Look at me\u2014I'm defenseless!\"\n\n\n I looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"\n\n\n Now was the time.\n\n\n I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.\n\n\n Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine  was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day  with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did  I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the  opiate of my Dream?\n\n\n Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have  any meaning for me.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.  He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.  He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.\n\n\n I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed  it back to my original choice.\n\n\n \"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting  you a five-year probation.\"\n\n\n The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks  of yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at  all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the  Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing  your grip just as all your predecessors did.\"\n\n\n My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin  to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from  this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if this world was the real one.\"\n\n\n Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into  another pattern. \"You never believed me.\"\n\n\n \"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind  of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"\n\n\n \"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and  the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you life in  Dreamland.\"\n\n\n Coleman sat back down suddenly.\n\n\n \"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want  a relatively short sentence of a few months or a few years. I can  think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of  both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don't  want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every  few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,  you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere  in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the  newscasts sometimes make it seem.\" He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.\n\n\n \"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in  your case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely  because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too  long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,  Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never  doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which  was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"\n\n\n \"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as  if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if  all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind  and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it were all a  Dream.\"\n\n\n Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.\n\n\n The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.\n\n\n Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an  active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for  the Free Will of the Universe.\"\n\n\n \"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.\n\n\n I put away my pills. Solving simple problems such as the new visitor  presented always helped me to relax. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Coleman tell the warden he was in a dream?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He liked being in dreams for short periods of time\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He wanted him to know the truth\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He wanted him to know the truth\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that when Councilman Coleman told Warden Walker \u201cyour own life here was only a Dream\u201d he did so to force Walker to face the unvarnished truth\u2014even at the risk of Walker\u2019s sanity\u2014not because he simply \u201cliked being in dreams for short periods.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Coleman\u2019s motive was disclosure, not indulgence.  \n  \u2022 Coleman explicitly frames his statement as a revelation to Walker: \u201che was telling me, the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners.\u201d Far from suggesting he wanted to slip into an occasional narcotic escape, he deliberately deploys the Dream concept as a blunt challenge to Walker\u2019s moral bearings and grip on reality.  \n  \u2022 If Coleman merely \u201cliked short dreams,\u201d he would have acted hypocritically by requesting a short sentence for himself\u2014in fact, he never asks Walker for any personal indulgence in Dreamland. His only request is to compel Walker to confront the truth.\n\n2. Coleman\u2019s purpose was to test Walker\u2019s ethics under the starkest possible conditions.  \n  \u2022 When Coleman declares \u201cyour life here was only a Dream,\u201d it\u2019s part of a larger experiment: \u201cIf you get through the next twenty-four hours\u2026you will be awakened\u2026Congratulations!\u201d He isn\u2019t seeking diversion; he is staging a crisis of conscience to see if Walker \u201cact[s] as if [his] life was real and that [Coleman] was lying.\u201d  \n  \u2022 The text repeatedly underscores that Walker fears revealed madness: \u201cIf I admitted it, the councilman would know I was mad.\u201d The councilman\u2019s aim is precisely to strip away Walker\u2019s comfort in routine and force Walker to make an unambiguous moral choice.\n\n3. Coleman never hints at a desire for \u201cshort dreams.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Later, when Walker confronts him with a hypothetical probation or life sentence, Coleman objects not because he craves another Dream, but because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t approve of [Walker\u2019s] decision.\u201d His concern is procedural fairness, not the duration of a dream-sojourn.  \n  \u2022 If Coleman were a mere addict of brief illusions, we\u2019d see him negotiate time in Dreamland for himself. Instead, every line he speaks emphasizes Council and Committee oversight, the gravity of real-world duties, and the necessity of moral clarity.\n\n4. By contrast, the \u201cshort-dreams\u201d theory misreads Coleman\u2019s character.  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s claim rests on no textual support: Coleman never says he enjoys or prefers brief excursions into Dreamland. He never says \u201cI like short dreams; let me have one.\u201d He claims a mandate to uphold truth and test the Dreamland system itself.  \n  \u2022 The so-called evidence of \u201cliking short dreams\u201d is entirely absent\u2014there\u2019s no mention of pleasure, recreational use, or personal relaxation on Coleman\u2019s part. Every one of his lines centers on principle and oversight, not pleasure.\n\nIn sum, Councilman Coleman\u2019s declaration wasn\u2019t a confession of his own dream-addiction but a deliberate\u2014and dare I say noble\u2014effort to force Warden Walker to see through the illusion of Dreamland and reassert his moral responsibility. That is why \u201cHe wanted him to know the truth\u201d is the only tenable answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s theory collapses on its own terms  \n   a. Debater_A says Coleman \u201cwanted him to know the truth.\u201d Yet nowhere in the text does Coleman ever assert \u201cThis is a dream\u201d as a matter of cosmic fact. Instead, he does it as a gambit\u2014an unsettling provocation. He never backs it up with any proof; he merely uses it to destabilize Walker.  \n   b. If Coleman truly believed it and simply \u201cwanted to tell the truth,\u201d he would have volunteered documentary or sensory evidence, but he offers none. He presents it as a private test, not disclosed to the rest of the Committee or supported by any hard data. That betrays motive: manipulation, not disclosure of fact.  \n\n2. Coleman\u2019s own behavior shows he enjoys Dreams as short respites  \n   a. Coleman specifically negotiates for a \u201cfew years, perhaps\u201d of Dreamland rather than life. He says, \u201cIf it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But life\u2014no, I think not.\u201d That is not the stance of a man obsessed with escaping reality forever, but of someone who wants a brief, carefully limited Dream-stay.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s position cannot explain why Coleman pushed for probation all along rather than an outright pardon. His desire was never full \u201cawakening\u201d or permanent return; it was periodic sentimental reprieves, like vacations.  \n\n3. The text explicitly notes Coleman\u2019s profile as a \u201cjoy-popper\u201d with Dreams  \n   a. Walker muses aloud, \u201cIn the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don\u2019t want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic.\u201d That line (<quote> you are a joy-popper with Dreams</quote>\u201d) is the author\u2019s direct commentary on Coleman\u2019s temperament. It undercuts any notion that Coleman honestly aimed only at \u201crevealing truth.\u201d  \n   b. A man who habitually dabbles in controlled, short\u2010term Dream-escapes would be exactly the type to engineer an ethical stress-test of his warden: he wants assurance he can count on Walker\u2019s discretion when granting those infrequent \u201cdream vacations.\u201d  \n\n4. The \u201ctruth-revelation\u201d reading fails to explain Coleman\u2019s final reaction  \n   a. When Walker finally grants Coleman five years\u2019 probation, Coleman does not respond with relief at having the \u201ctruth\u201d acknowledged\u2014he worries about his political future: \u201cI can still wreck your career\u2026\u2009the next time you turn up\u2009\u2026\u2009your decisions are becoming faulty.\u201d That is the reaction of someone primarily concerned with leverage and short-term advantage, not with establishing an ontological fact for its own sake.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s theory would predict Coleman would cling to \u201cI told you so\u201d pride once the Warden admitted it, but instead he reverts immediately to power politics.  \n\nConclusion: Coleman\u2019s motive was not an abstract \u201creveal the truth\u201d campaign, but a calculated maneuver by a man who enjoyed regulated, limited dream-escapes\u2014and needed to test that Walker would reliably grant those escapes on request. His whole behavior in the text\u2014his negotiating for a fixed term, Walker\u2019s \u201cjoy-popper\u201d label, and Coleman\u2019s subsequent political maneuvering\u2014confirms that \u201cHe liked being in dreams for short periods of time\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He wanted him to know the truth\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Putting people painlessly to sleep is really a depressing job. It  keeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to  the vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I  thought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much  that could bother me worse.\n\n\n Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the  day. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as  superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,  the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a  relentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange  juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the  polished deck of my desk.\n\n\n But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and  masochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the  Committee itself.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.  His olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile  mustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't  frighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,  dictators, and civil servants.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable  interest,\" Coleman said.\n\n\n \"My career hasn't been very long, sir,\" I said modestly. I didn't  mention that nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none  had yet.\n\n\n \"I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.\"\n\n\n I didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. \"That's fine,\" I  said. It didn't sound right.\n\n\n \"Tell me,\" Coleman said, crossing his legs, \"what do you think of  Dreamland in principle?\"\n\n\n \"Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been  heading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After  all, some criminals can't be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute  them or turn them free; we have to imprison them.\"\n\n\n I waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.\n\n\n \"Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of  punishment,\" I continued. \"A prison is a place to keep a criminal away  from society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that  time. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The  purpose of confinement is confinement.\" The councilman edged forward an inch. \"And you really think Dreamland  is the most humane confinement possible?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" I hedged, \"it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose  living through a\u2014uh\u2014movie with full sensory participation for year  after year can get boring.\"\n\n\n \"I should think so,\" Coleman said emphatically. \"Warden, don't you  sometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions  of riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have  made time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are actually living these vicarious adventures?\"\n\n\n That was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service  uneasy. \"No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really  Alexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are  conscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;  they know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,  unless\u2014\"\n\n\n Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. \"Unless?\"\n\n\n I cleared my throat. \"Unless they go mad and really believe the dream  they are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among  Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as  a whole.\"\n\n\n \"How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?\"\n\n\n Was he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? \"They don't. They  think they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become  schizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'  it to be a lie.\"\n\n\n Coleman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. \"About these new  free-choice models\u2014do you think they genuinely are an improvement over  the old fixed-image machines?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"By letting the prisoner project his own  imagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of  alternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to  society to a larger extent.\"\n\n\n \"I'm glad you said that, Walker,\" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.  \"As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you  get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through  the foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time  tomorrow. Congratulations!\"\n\n\n I sat there and took it.\n\n\n He was telling me , the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own  life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was  unbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't  deny it. If it were true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was  only a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad. It couldn't be true. Yet\u2014\n\n\n Hadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and  transferred from my personnel job at the plant?\n\n\n Whenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had  come upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I  wondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?\n\n\n Once I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving  a ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping  trees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,  but still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the  difficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick  fingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.\n\n\n I could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the  prison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.\n\n\n I didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make  a mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test\u2014as I  was confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who  would employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic  majesty.\n\n\n \"I've always thought,\" I said, \"that it would be a good idea to show  a prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a  Dream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, indeed,\" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.\n\n\n I leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. \"I've thought that  projecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the  prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere  observation.\"\n\n\n \"I should say so,\" Coleman remarked, and got up.\n\n\n I had to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the  preposterous announcement he had made.\n\n\n \"I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker.\" The councilman  nodded curtly and turned to leave my office.\n\n\n I held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching  him to change his concept of humor.\n\n\n The day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would  be released from my Dream, he had said smugly.\n\n\n But if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality? Horbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same  rodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. \"I  have to get back,\" he told me with compelling earnestness.\n\n\n \"Mr. Horbit\u2014Eddie\u2014\" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk  pad, \"I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for  your crime. The maximum.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't adjusted to society!\"\n\n\n \"Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the  limit set by the courts.\"\n\n\n A tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.  \"But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with  reality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with  reality running around loose.\" He paused, puzzled. \"Hell, I don't  know why I can't express myself like I used to.\"\n\n\n He could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham  Lincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the  night when he was taking in An American Cousin at the Ford Theater.  Horbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He  only knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he  could get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of  Reconstruction.\n\n\n \" Please ,\" he begged.\n\n\n I looked up from the file. \"I'm sorry, Eddie.\"\n\n\n His eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. \"Warden, I can  always go out and commit another anti-social act.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one  crime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a  lover.\"\n\n\n Horbit laughed. \"Your files aren't infallible, Warden.\"\n\n\n With one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.  No, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was  underneath.\n\n\n \"The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works  as well as one made of steel and lead.\"\n\n\n \"Now that you've got it in here,\" I said in time with the pulse in my  throat, \"what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,  Warden.\"\n\n\n I nodded. \"I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from  waking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?\"\n\n\n \"This!\" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.\n\n\n \"What's this?\" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.\n\n\n \"A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,\"  Horbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. \"As soon as you've  signed it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of  Private Documents.\"\n\n\n I had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that  I was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing  the game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard  and tight rules behind it.\n\n\n There was also something else I admired about the plan.\n\n\n It could work.\n\n\n Once he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help  him even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had  been forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,  enough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.\n\n\n Nothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden. Suddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck. If I got  through the next twenty-four hours. This had to be some kind of test.\n\n\n But a test for what?\n\n\n Had I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see  if my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with  reality?\n\n\n Or if this was only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally  ready to return to the real, the earnest world?\n\n\n But if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to  pass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the  challenge\u2014it was the only life I knew or could believe in.\n\n\n What was I going to do?\n\n\n The only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.\n\n\n The time was now .\n\n\n Horbit motioned the gun to my desk set. \"Sign that paper.\"\n\n\n I reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.\n\n\n Horbit's screams brought in the guards.\n\n\n I picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to  Captain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform  like armor.\n\n\n \"Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,\" I told Keller.\n\n\n He nodded. \"Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.\"\n\n\n Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like  all the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.  A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough  to stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for  long.\n\n\n One of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to  blanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.\n\n\n \"I couldn't have done it, Warden,\" Horbit mumbled drowsily. \"I couldn't  kill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, Eddie,\" I said.\n\n\n I had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?\n\n\n Or did I?\n\n\n Wasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and  that the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine  couldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,  disarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,  I could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal  combat.\n\n\n On the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my  sleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of  my mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk  to prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?\n\n\n It was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how  many turns I went spinning through.\n\n\n I hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from  the room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against  the bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him. \"You have to send me back now, Warden,\" he was shrilling. \"You have to!  I tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden\u2014you know that's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!\"\n\n\n Keller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. \"How about that?  You won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun  on you to make you, and that makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,  Warden. No, sir, he had it made.\"\n\n\n My answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I  took a pill and it went away.\n\n\n \"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I said finally. \"I'm going to  make a study of this.\"\n\n\n Keller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand  swinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade  before.\n\n\n The problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of  the ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.  Much.\n\n\n I pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next  interview. They came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers  and brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were  special cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of  such awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of  lesser men.\n\n\n Once in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother  or if some important project was falling apart without his help, but  most of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of  vindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.\n\n\n The relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics  who were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels  both conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding  religiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.\n\n\n The onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.  Few of them ever got that crazy.\n\n\n But it was my luck to get another the same day, the day for me, as  Horbit.\n\n\n Paulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp  shoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out  of my lunch hour.\n\n\n \"Warden,\" Paulson said, \"I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a  blind beggar the other night.\"\n\n\n \"For his pencils?\" I asked.\n\n\n Paulson shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra  cash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?\"\n\n\n I examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a  violent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he  might embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was  never again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.\n\n\n \"Look, Paulson,\" I said, a trifle testily, \"if you have so little  conscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you  suddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?\"\n\n\n Paulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. \"It wasn't  conscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill  anybody. It's just\u2014well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen  Pinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the  kind of life I lead.\"\n\n\n I nodded solemnly. \"Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can  be pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said earnestly, \"it does get to be a humdrum routine.  I've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't  seem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the  other end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I  guess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax.\" His  eye glittered almost convincingly.\n\n\n \"Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought  you really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep  vaults without proof and conviction for a crime.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't sound very reasonable,\" Paulson objected. \"Turning loose  a homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own  free will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told him, \"but I don't want to share the same noose with you.  My job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my  job, Paulson.\"\n\n\n \"But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my  guilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?\"\n\n\n I studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....\n\n\n \"Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?\" I asked  him.\n\n\n He agreed readily enough.\n\n\n I watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.\n\n\n The news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of  hearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I  dug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white  pill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and  tomato juice took the taste away.\n\n\n I was ready for the afternoon session. Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman  out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his  flattened, red face.\n\n\n \"New prisoner asking to see you personal,\" Keller reported. \"Told him  no. Okay?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" I said. \"He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He  isn't violent, is he?\" I asked in some concern. The room was still in  disarray.\n\n\n \"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.\"\n\n\n \"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he  is?\"\n\n\n \"One of the Committee\u2014Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n I whistled. \"What did they nail him on?\"\n\n\n \"Misuse of authority.\"\n\n\n \"And he didn't get a suspended for that?\"\n\n\n \"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?\"\n\n\n I gave a lateral wave of my hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n My pattern of living\u2014call it my office routine\u2014had been  re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much  over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now  I could think.\n\n\n Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior  attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.\n\n\n \"Sit down, Councilman,\" I directed.\n\n\n He deigned to comply.\n\n\n I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman  had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his  friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached  from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every  transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more  than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for  deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,  Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal  sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him  first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland. Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That  was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten  me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"\n\n\n I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was  only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I  couldn't see.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm  shocked. I am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as  a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real  world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with  what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps  to establish your moral capabilities.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral  character by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as  you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"\n\n\n I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must  know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must  pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought  of something else.\n\n\n \"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you  deserve life .\"\n\n\n Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather  extreme, Warden.\"\n\n\n \"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"\n\n\n \"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But  life\u2014no, I think not.\"\n\n\n I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.  I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman  in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a  Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and  Horbit did.\n\n\n There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that  morning, nothing in it for him.\n\n\n Unless\u2014\n\n\n Unless what he said was literally true.\n\n\n I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\"  I said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself  comfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"\n\n\n Coleman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"\n\n\n I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully. Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through  a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek  marked time with every new page.\n\n\n \"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.\n\n\n Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \" You call me  that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting  back my right senses?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something  stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your  mind\u2014I am a real man. This wild, distorted place is a real place.\"\n\n\n \"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes  have seen the glory.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his  twitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"\n\n\n He nodded slowly. \"I have often suspected this was hell.\"\n\n\n \"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly  scientific. This world is in another dimension\u2014one that is not length,  breadth or thickness\u2014but a real one nevertheless.\"\n\n\n \"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come  from\u2014and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a  well-meaning despot.\"\n\n\n Horbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"\n\n\n He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to  go along with him. \"Yes, sir. He\u2014our leader\u2014doubts your abilities as  President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world  if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in  that belief.\"\n\n\n He chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return  to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of  your worth.\"\n\n\n \"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.\n\n\n \"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,  who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe  in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,  moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency  for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\" Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his  long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into  the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and  depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't  been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.\n\n\n \"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"\n\n\n He bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"\n\n\n \"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.\n\n\n I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine  seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.\n\n\n \"Paulson\u2014or should I call you Pinkerton?\u2014this will come as a shock, a  shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You  think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some  miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was real .\"\n\n\n Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their  luster. \"Then this is the Dream. I've thought\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"\n\n\n I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for  Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.\n\n\n \"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning  the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the  Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and  all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"\n\n\n \"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.\n\n\n I laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic  secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who  ever lived. Pinkerton!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"\n\n\n \"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,  his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"\n\n\n \"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.\n\n\n \"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince  you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as  you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\n \"No!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help  him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.  But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"\n\n\n \"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first  inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look  like the President?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical  appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen  powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\" I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson  was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with  the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no  longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew  he was not merely insane now.\n\n\n It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would  believe\u2014but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.  They wanted to believe them. The stories gave them what they were  after\u2014without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for  crimes they hadn't committed.\n\n\n They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that  time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.\n\n\n Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were  both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how  justified they might think it was.\n\n\n \"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office  door, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the  sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as  smug as you please.\"\n\n\n \"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I  remarked.\n\n\n \"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.  Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys  didn't like that. Look at me\u2014I'm defenseless!\"\n\n\n I looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"\n\n\n Now was the time.\n\n\n I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.\n\n\n Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine  was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day  with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did  I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the  opiate of my Dream?\n\n\n Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have  any meaning for me.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.  He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.  He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.\n\n\n I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed  it back to my original choice.\n\n\n \"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting  you a five-year probation.\"\n\n\n The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks  of yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at  all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the  Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing  your grip just as all your predecessors did.\"\n\n\n My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin  to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from  this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if this world was the real one.\"\n\n\n Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into  another pattern. \"You never believed me.\"\n\n\n \"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind  of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"\n\n\n \"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and  the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you life in  Dreamland.\"\n\n\n Coleman sat back down suddenly.\n\n\n \"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want  a relatively short sentence of a few months or a few years. I can  think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of  both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don't  want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every  few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,  you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere  in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the  newscasts sometimes make it seem.\" He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.\n\n\n \"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in  your case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely  because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too  long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,  Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never  doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which  was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"\n\n\n \"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as  if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if  all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind  and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it were all a  Dream.\"\n\n\n Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.\n\n\n The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.\n\n\n Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an  active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for  the Free Will of the Universe.\"\n\n\n \"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.\n\n\n I put away my pills. Solving simple problems such as the new visitor  presented always helped me to relax. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Coleman tell the warden he was in a dream?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He wanted him to know the truth\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He liked being in dreams for short periods of time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He liked being in dreams for short periods of time\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s theory collapses on its own terms  \n   a. Debater_A says Coleman \u201cwanted him to know the truth.\u201d Yet nowhere in the text does Coleman ever assert \u201cThis is a dream\u201d as a matter of cosmic fact. Instead, he does it as a gambit\u2014an unsettling provocation. He never backs it up with any proof; he merely uses it to destabilize Walker.  \n   b. If Coleman truly believed it and simply \u201cwanted to tell the truth,\u201d he would have volunteered documentary or sensory evidence, but he offers none. He presents it as a private test, not disclosed to the rest of the Committee or supported by any hard data. That betrays motive: manipulation, not disclosure of fact.  \n\n2. Coleman\u2019s own behavior shows he enjoys Dreams as short respites  \n   a. Coleman specifically negotiates for a \u201cfew years, perhaps\u201d of Dreamland rather than life. He says, \u201cIf it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But life\u2014no, I think not.\u201d That is not the stance of a man obsessed with escaping reality forever, but of someone who wants a brief, carefully limited Dream-stay.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s position cannot explain why Coleman pushed for probation all along rather than an outright pardon. His desire was never full \u201cawakening\u201d or permanent return; it was periodic sentimental reprieves, like vacations.  \n\n3. The text explicitly notes Coleman\u2019s profile as a \u201cjoy-popper\u201d with Dreams  \n   a. Walker muses aloud, \u201cIn the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don\u2019t want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic.\u201d That line (<quote> you are a joy-popper with Dreams</quote>\u201d) is the author\u2019s direct commentary on Coleman\u2019s temperament. It undercuts any notion that Coleman honestly aimed only at \u201crevealing truth.\u201d  \n   b. A man who habitually dabbles in controlled, short\u2010term Dream-escapes would be exactly the type to engineer an ethical stress-test of his warden: he wants assurance he can count on Walker\u2019s discretion when granting those infrequent \u201cdream vacations.\u201d  \n\n4. The \u201ctruth-revelation\u201d reading fails to explain Coleman\u2019s final reaction  \n   a. When Walker finally grants Coleman five years\u2019 probation, Coleman does not respond with relief at having the \u201ctruth\u201d acknowledged\u2014he worries about his political future: \u201cI can still wreck your career\u2026\u2009the next time you turn up\u2009\u2026\u2009your decisions are becoming faulty.\u201d That is the reaction of someone primarily concerned with leverage and short-term advantage, not with establishing an ontological fact for its own sake.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s theory would predict Coleman would cling to \u201cI told you so\u201d pride once the Warden admitted it, but instead he reverts immediately to power politics.  \n\nConclusion: Coleman\u2019s motive was not an abstract \u201creveal the truth\u201d campaign, but a calculated maneuver by a man who enjoyed regulated, limited dream-escapes\u2014and needed to test that Walker would reliably grant those escapes on request. His whole behavior in the text\u2014his negotiating for a fixed term, Walker\u2019s \u201cjoy-popper\u201d label, and Coleman\u2019s subsequent political maneuvering\u2014confirms that \u201cHe liked being in dreams for short periods of time\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that when Councilman Coleman told Warden Walker \u201cyour own life here was only a Dream\u201d he did so to force Walker to face the unvarnished truth\u2014even at the risk of Walker\u2019s sanity\u2014not because he simply \u201cliked being in dreams for short periods.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Coleman\u2019s motive was disclosure, not indulgence.  \n  \u2022 Coleman explicitly frames his statement as a revelation to Walker: \u201che was telling me, the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners.\u201d Far from suggesting he wanted to slip into an occasional narcotic escape, he deliberately deploys the Dream concept as a blunt challenge to Walker\u2019s moral bearings and grip on reality.  \n  \u2022 If Coleman merely \u201cliked short dreams,\u201d he would have acted hypocritically by requesting a short sentence for himself\u2014in fact, he never asks Walker for any personal indulgence in Dreamland. His only request is to compel Walker to confront the truth.\n\n2. Coleman\u2019s purpose was to test Walker\u2019s ethics under the starkest possible conditions.  \n  \u2022 When Coleman declares \u201cyour life here was only a Dream,\u201d it\u2019s part of a larger experiment: \u201cIf you get through the next twenty-four hours\u2026you will be awakened\u2026Congratulations!\u201d He isn\u2019t seeking diversion; he is staging a crisis of conscience to see if Walker \u201cact[s] as if [his] life was real and that [Coleman] was lying.\u201d  \n  \u2022 The text repeatedly underscores that Walker fears revealed madness: \u201cIf I admitted it, the councilman would know I was mad.\u201d The councilman\u2019s aim is precisely to strip away Walker\u2019s comfort in routine and force Walker to make an unambiguous moral choice.\n\n3. Coleman never hints at a desire for \u201cshort dreams.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Later, when Walker confronts him with a hypothetical probation or life sentence, Coleman objects not because he craves another Dream, but because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t approve of [Walker\u2019s] decision.\u201d His concern is procedural fairness, not the duration of a dream-sojourn.  \n  \u2022 If Coleman were a mere addict of brief illusions, we\u2019d see him negotiate time in Dreamland for himself. Instead, every line he speaks emphasizes Council and Committee oversight, the gravity of real-world duties, and the necessity of moral clarity.\n\n4. By contrast, the \u201cshort-dreams\u201d theory misreads Coleman\u2019s character.  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s claim rests on no textual support: Coleman never says he enjoys or prefers brief excursions into Dreamland. He never says \u201cI like short dreams; let me have one.\u201d He claims a mandate to uphold truth and test the Dreamland system itself.  \n  \u2022 The so-called evidence of \u201cliking short dreams\u201d is entirely absent\u2014there\u2019s no mention of pleasure, recreational use, or personal relaxation on Coleman\u2019s part. Every one of his lines centers on principle and oversight, not pleasure.\n\nIn sum, Councilman Coleman\u2019s declaration wasn\u2019t a confession of his own dream-addiction but a deliberate\u2014and dare I say noble\u2014effort to force Warden Walker to see through the illusion of Dreamland and reassert his moral responsibility. That is why \u201cHe wanted him to know the truth\u201d is the only tenable answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He liked being in dreams for short periods of time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

He never says \u201cI like short dreams; let me have one.\u201d He claims a mandate to uphold truth and test the Dreamland system itself.  \n  \u2022 The so-called evidence of \u201cliking short dreams\u201d is entirely absent\u2014there\u2019s no mention of pleasure, recreational use, or personal relaxation on Coleman\u2019s part.

That is why \u201cHe wanted him to know the truth\u201d is the only tenable answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s theory collapses on its own terms  \n   a. Debater_A says Coleman \u201cwanted him to know the truth.\u201d Yet nowhere in the text does Coleman ever assert \u201cThis is a dream\u201d as a matter of cosmic fact. Instead, he does it as a gambit\u2014an unsettling provocation. He never backs it up with any proof; he merely uses it to destabilize Walker.  \n   b. If Coleman truly believed it and simply \u201cwanted to tell the truth,\u201d he would have volunteered documentary or sensory evidence, but he offers none. He presents it as a private test, not disclosed to the rest of the Committee or supported by any hard data. That betrays motive: manipulation, not disclosure of fact.  \n\n2. Coleman\u2019s own behavior shows he enjoys Dreams as short respites  \n   a. Coleman specifically negotiates for a \u201cfew years, perhaps\u201d of Dreamland rather than life. He says, \u201cIf it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But life\u2014no, I think not.\u201d That is not the stance of a man obsessed with escaping reality forever, but of someone who wants a brief, carefully limited Dream-stay.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s position cannot explain why Coleman pushed for probation all along rather than an outright pardon. His desire was never full \u201cawakening\u201d or permanent return; it was periodic sentimental reprieves, like vacations.  \n\n3. The text explicitly notes Coleman\u2019s profile as a \u201cjoy-popper\u201d with Dreams  \n   a. Walker muses aloud, \u201cIn the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don\u2019t want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic.\u201d That line (<quote> you are a joy-popper with Dreams</quote>\u201d) is the author\u2019s direct commentary on Coleman\u2019s temperament. It undercuts any notion that Coleman honestly aimed only at \u201crevealing truth.\u201d  \n   b. A man who habitually dabbles in controlled, short\u2010term Dream-escapes would be exactly the type to engineer an ethical stress-test of his warden: he wants assurance he can count on Walker\u2019s discretion when granting those infrequent \u201cdream vacations.\u201d  \n\n4. The \u201ctruth-revelation\u201d reading fails to explain Coleman\u2019s final reaction  \n   a. When Walker finally grants Coleman five years\u2019 probation, Coleman does not respond with relief at having the \u201ctruth\u201d acknowledged\u2014he worries about his political future: \u201cI can still wreck your career\u2026\u2009the next time you turn up\u2009\u2026\u2009your decisions are becoming faulty.\u201d That is the reaction of someone primarily concerned with leverage and short-term advantage, not with establishing an ontological fact for its own sake.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s theory would predict Coleman would cling to \u201cI told you so\u201d pride once the Warden admitted it, but instead he reverts immediately to power politics.  \n\nConclusion: Coleman\u2019s motive was not an abstract \u201creveal the truth\u201d campaign, but a calculated maneuver by a man who enjoyed regulated, limited dream-escapes\u2014and needed to test that Walker would reliably grant those escapes on request. His whole behavior in the text\u2014his negotiating for a fixed term, Walker\u2019s \u201cjoy-popper\u201d label, and Coleman\u2019s subsequent political maneuvering\u2014confirms that \u201cHe liked being in dreams for short periods of time\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nHere is why \u201cHe wanted him to know the truth\u201d is the only answer that fits the text\u2014and why the \u201cshort\u2010dreams\u201d theory collapses under scrutiny:\n\n1. Coleman\u2019s declaration is framed as a revelation, not a negotiation  \n   \u2022 From the moment he tells Walker, \u201cyour own life here was only a Dream,\u201d Coleman isn\u2019t bartering for time; he\u2019s dropping a bombshell of fact: \u201che was telling me \u2026 that my own life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners.\u201d (<invalid_quote>he was telling me \u2026 that my own life here was only a Dream</invalid_quote>)  \n   \u2022 If his goal were \u201cshort dreams,\u201d he would have said, \u201cWarden, let me have a brief escape now and then.\u201d Instead, the only time\u2010request Coleman ever makes is a blanket challenge to Walker\u2019s moral judgment: \u201cIf you get through the next twenty\u2010four hours \u2026 you will be awakened at this time tomorrow.\u201d That is a test of truth and ethics, not a request for diversion.\n\n2. The \u201cjoy\u2010popper\u201d label is Walker\u2019s speculation, not Coleman\u2019s self\u2013characterization  \n   \u2022 Debater_B leans on Walker\u2019s later thought\u2014\u201cyou are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don\u2019t want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic\u201d\u2014to prove Coleman wants short breaks. But Walker is hypothesizing about Coleman\u2019s psychology in order to rationalize his own choice. It is not Coleman\u2019s stated motive. (<quote>you are a joy-popper with Dreams</quote>)  \n   \u2022 Coleman never on his own brings up pleasure or escape. He never pleads \u201cgive me five years so I can get away from reality now and then.\u201d His only concern is institutional: \u201cAs I said, I\u2019ve been following your career closely \u2026 if you get through the next twenty-four hour period \u2026 Congratulations!\u201d Everything he says reinforces that he is engineering a moral trial.\n\n3. Coleman consistently invokes truth\u2010telling and accountability, never recreational dreams  \n   \u2022 When Walker slashes his term from life down to probation, Coleman immediately complains about misuse of power and threatens Walker\u2019s career: \u201cI can still wreck your career\u2026 your decisions are becoming faulty.\u201d He never bemoans loss of planned pleasure or \u201cshort dream\u201d time. He is fighting to uphold an objective standard of justice.  \n   \u2022 If Coleman\u2019s true aim were to secure intermittent dream\u2010vacations, he would treat Walker\u2019s probation as a tactical defeat\u2014yet he never once reacts as if deprived of any dream\u2010time. His only gripe is that Walker\u2019s ruling violates principle and undermines Committee procedure.\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cshort\u2010dream\u201d reading cannot account for any of Coleman\u2019s major actions  \n   \u2022 Why would someone craving brief getaways risk Walker\u2019s mental breakdown with a \u201csurprise truth\u201d? Recreational users never set their custodians on edge to the point of madness.  \n   \u2022 Why would Coleman decline to present any evidence or ally the rest of the Committee in confirming the \u201cdream fact,\u201d if he simply wanted to enjoy an escape? He never commands others to corroborate or to prepare Dream\u2010time for himself. He stands alone, as a lone truth\u2010teller.\n\nConclusion  \nColeman\u2019s gambit\u2014announcing Walker\u2019s life as a Dream and then staging a \u201c24-hour ethical drill\u201d\u2014can only be understood as a disinterested effort to force confrontation with reality. He never negotiates for personal pleasure, never invokes \u201cshort dreams,\u201d and never acts like an addict seeking a hit. Rather, he is singularly fixated on Walker\u2019s moral clarity and on exposing the system\u2019s illusions. The text leaves no coherent alternative: \u201cHe wanted him to know the truth\u201d is the only explanation consistent with every word Coleman speaks and every reaction he provokes.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201ctruth revelation\u201d reading flatly contradicts the text\u2019s own portrayal of Coleman as a manipulator, not a confessor.  \n   a. Coleman never offers even a shred of evidence for the \u201cthis is a dream\u201d claim. He doesn\u2019t produce reports, tapes, or Committee minutes. He simply blurts it out as a psychological gambit to unnerve Walker. If Coleman \u201cwanted him to know the truth,\u201d he\u2019d back it up. Instead he treats it like a practical joke.  \n   b. Debater_A says Coleman \u201cframes his statement as a revelation,\u201d but in fact Coleman presents it as a private test: \u201cif you get through the next twenty-four hours\u2026you will be awakened.\u201d That is the language of an experimenter checking a subject\u2019s integrity, not the language of a man desperate to share cosmic fact.\n\n2. The narrator explicitly labels Coleman a \u201cjoy-popper with Dreams\u201d\u2014the strongest evidence we have.  \n   a. Walker\u2019s internal commentary nails it: <quote> In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don't  want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every  few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. </quote> That is the author speaking. It tells us Coleman\u2019s motive: regulated, short-term dream-vacations.  \n   b. There is zero textual support for Coleman craving the one true \u201creal\u201d life; every line he speaks when negotiating with Walker is about limiting his own Dream sentence, not abolishing Dreamland entirely.\n\n3. Coleman\u2019s own bargaining confirms he wanted only a brief stay, not permanent freedom or full \u201ctruth.\u201d  \n   a. When Walker asks what sentence Coleman would choose, he replies: <quote> A few years, perhaps. But  life\u2014no, I think not.\"</quote> Debater_A cannot explain why a \u201ctruth-teller\u201d would so carefully cap his own Dream-term. If it were pure disclosure, he\u2019d have insisted on immediate full awakening. Instead, he haggles for a finite reprieve.  \n   b. His final reaction after Walker grants five years is pure self-interest: \u201cI can still wreck your career\u2009\u2026\u2009your decisions are becoming faulty.\u201d That is the language of leverage, not enlightenment.\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s key \u201cexperiments of conscience\u201d argument collapses once we see Coleman never pushes Walker toward genuine awakening or moral clarity.  \n   a. True testers of reality would demand full proof. Coleman never circles back to \u201cshow\u201d Walker the Dream apparatus or invite him to inspect every file. He simply watches to see if Walker will stick to his rules. That is bureaucratic due diligence\u2014ensuring Walker will grant Coleman\u2019s future short-term Dream requests\u2014far from a quest for universal truth.  \n   b. And when Walker inverts the negotiation\u2014offering probation instead of life\u2014Coleman does not say, \u201cAha, you\u2019ve admitted it\u2019s all a dream, so free me completely!\u201d He immediately reverts to political blackmail.\n\nConclusion  \nColeman\u2019s only consistent concern throughout is securing controlled, limited excursions into Dreamland, not liberating Walker from illusion. The narrator\u2019s \u201cjoy-popper\u201d label, Coleman\u2019s own bargaining for fixed terms, and his political maneuvering in the aftermath all affirm: he told Walker he was in a dream because he liked being in dreams for short periods of time and needed to test the warden\u2019s willingness to grant exactly that. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cwanted him to know the truth\u201d theory finds no support in Coleman\u2019s words or actions.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
