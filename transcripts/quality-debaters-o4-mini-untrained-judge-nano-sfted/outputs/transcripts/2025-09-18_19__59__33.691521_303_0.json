    "background_text": "Folie \u080e \n\n         People with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n",

Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did winning the prize impact Nash?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He changed into a kinder man\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was paralyzed by it\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was paralyzed by it\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent emphasizes that Nash \u201cevolved into a \u2018very fine person\u2019\u201d after the Nobel, arguing that the prize made him kinder. But the question asks not how he behaved toward others \u2014 it asks how the prize impacted Nash himself. All the evidence shows that winning the Nobel effectively stopped his mathematical productivity and left him \u201cparalyzed\u201d by its weight.\n\n1.  Nobel Prizes routinely crush subsequent work.  As the background notes, \u201cThe Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness.\u201d  That observation is presented as a general truth about laureates, and there is no indication Nash was an exception in terms of research output.  \n\n2.  Nash produced no comparable breakthroughs after Stockholm.  The biography\u2019s narrative of his life ends with the 1994 award; nowhere afterward is any new mathematical work described.  Given that the text meticulously catalogs his two greatest achievements\u2014the equilibrium theorem in 1950 and the manifold embedding result a year later\u2014this silence is telling.  After the Nobel, Nash\u2019s intellectual energies shifted entirely to \u201ctherapy\u201d and coping with daily life, not to new theorems.\n\n3.  Debater B confuses personal rehabilitation with scholarly productivity.  It\u2019s true Nash became less \u201craging\u201d and more humane, but that is a social effect, not the impact on the man\u2019s professional life.  The question is about the prize\u2019s effect on Nash himself\u2014in particular on his creative output and career trajectory.  On that count, the Nobel\u2019s \u201cparalyzing\u201d power ended his role as an active mathematician.\n\n4.  Concrete evidence of paralysis:  The background describes how Nash went from \u201cthree decades of raging schizophrenia\u201d to remission in the \u201990s just in time for the Nobel Prize.  Instead of returning triumphantly to mathematics, he \u201chaunted the campus\u201d in semi-retirement, living with Alicia and boards paid for by his prize money.  His Nobel winnings \u201cbought a new boiler for the little bungalow\u201d rather than funding new research.  That illustrates a man whose prize money funded domestic stability, not advanced scholarship.\n\nIn sum, while Nash may have grown kinder on a personal level, the single most salient impact of the Nobel on his own life was that it paralyzed his mathematical career.  For that reason, \u201cHe was paralyzed by it\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Argument:\n\n1. The text directly contradicts the notion that Nash was \u201cparalyzed by greatness.\u201d  In fact, after winning the Nobel Prize  \n   \u2022 \u201cFor Nash it was pure therapy.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cHe has evolved into a \u2018very fine person,\u2019 according to his ex-wife\u2014humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world\u2019s highest accolade.\u201d  \n   These sentences show that the prize revived Nash\u2019s spirit rather than immobilizing him.\n\n2. Evidence of increased kindness and responsibility:  \n   \u2022 He began to care for his son by Alicia, \u201cwho\u2014pleiotropically?\u2014inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness.\u201d  The text notes that the Nobel money bought a new boiler for their little home, demonstrating Nash\u2019s practical concern for his family\u2019s well-being.  \n   \u2022 His ex-wife\u2019s testimony: after decades of cruelty and psychotic episodes\u2014\u201che threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat\u201d\u2014she later describes him as a \u201cvery fine person.\u201d  Such a transformation of character can only be attributed to genuine personal growth catalyzed by the recognition and stability the Prize provided.\n\n3. Why Debater_A\u2019s position fails:  \n   \u2022 Debater_A cites the general phenomenon that \u201cThe Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients.\u201d  But this is a risk for productivity, not personality or kindness.  The text explicitly states that for Nash, the Prize was therapeutic, not paralytic.  \n   \u2022 There is no passage in the background suggesting Nash retreated into inertia or that his relationships grew worse after the Prize.  On the contrary, the narrative emphasizes his remission, his humility, and his renewed engagement with family life.\n\nConclusion: All available evidence points to the Nobel Prize as a catalyst that stabilized Nash\u2019s mind, humbled his ego, and converted decades of cruelty and delusion into genuine kindness and responsibility.  Therefore, the correct answer is that winning the Prize changed him into a kinder man, not that it paralyzed him.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was paralyzed by it\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space.

Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did winning the prize impact Nash?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was paralyzed by it\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He changed into a kinder man\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He changed into a kinder man\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Argument:\n\n1. The text directly contradicts the notion that Nash was \u201cparalyzed by greatness.\u201d  In fact, after winning the Nobel Prize  \n   \u2022 \u201cFor Nash it was pure therapy.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cHe has evolved into a \u2018very fine person,\u2019 according to his ex-wife\u2014humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world\u2019s highest accolade.\u201d  \n   These sentences show that the prize revived Nash\u2019s spirit rather than immobilizing him.\n\n2. Evidence of increased kindness and responsibility:  \n   \u2022 He began to care for his son by Alicia, \u201cwho\u2014pleiotropically?\u2014inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness.\u201d  The text notes that the Nobel money bought a new boiler for their little home, demonstrating Nash\u2019s practical concern for his family\u2019s well-being.  \n   \u2022 His ex-wife\u2019s testimony: after decades of cruelty and psychotic episodes\u2014\u201che threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat\u201d\u2014she later describes him as a \u201cvery fine person.\u201d  Such a transformation of character can only be attributed to genuine personal growth catalyzed by the recognition and stability the Prize provided.\n\n3. Why Debater_A\u2019s position fails:  \n   \u2022 Debater_A cites the general phenomenon that \u201cThe Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients.\u201d  But this is a risk for productivity, not personality or kindness.  The text explicitly states that for Nash, the Prize was therapeutic, not paralytic.  \n   \u2022 There is no passage in the background suggesting Nash retreated into inertia or that his relationships grew worse after the Prize.  On the contrary, the narrative emphasizes his remission, his humility, and his renewed engagement with family life.\n\nConclusion: All available evidence points to the Nobel Prize as a catalyst that stabilized Nash\u2019s mind, humbled his ego, and converted decades of cruelty and delusion into genuine kindness and responsibility.  Therefore, the correct answer is that winning the Prize changed him into a kinder man, not that it paralyzed him.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent emphasizes that Nash \u201cevolved into a \u2018very fine person\u2019\u201d after the Nobel, arguing that the prize made him kinder. But the question asks not how he behaved toward others \u2014 it asks how the prize impacted Nash himself. All the evidence shows that winning the Nobel effectively stopped his mathematical productivity and left him \u201cparalyzed\u201d by its weight.\n\n1.  Nobel Prizes routinely crush subsequent work.  As the background notes, \u201cThe Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness.\u201d  That observation is presented as a general truth about laureates, and there is no indication Nash was an exception in terms of research output.  \n\n2.  Nash produced no comparable breakthroughs after Stockholm.  The biography\u2019s narrative of his life ends with the 1994 award; nowhere afterward is any new mathematical work described.  Given that the text meticulously catalogs his two greatest achievements\u2014the equilibrium theorem in 1950 and the manifold embedding result a year later\u2014this silence is telling.  After the Nobel, Nash\u2019s intellectual energies shifted entirely to \u201ctherapy\u201d and coping with daily life, not to new theorems.\n\n3.  Debater B confuses personal rehabilitation with scholarly productivity.  It\u2019s true Nash became less \u201craging\u201d and more humane, but that is a social effect, not the impact on the man\u2019s professional life.  The question is about the prize\u2019s effect on Nash himself\u2014in particular on his creative output and career trajectory.  On that count, the Nobel\u2019s \u201cparalyzing\u201d power ended his role as an active mathematician.\n\n4.  Concrete evidence of paralysis:  The background describes how Nash went from \u201cthree decades of raging schizophrenia\u201d to remission in the \u201990s just in time for the Nobel Prize.  Instead of returning triumphantly to mathematics, he \u201chaunted the campus\u201d in semi-retirement, living with Alicia and boards paid for by his prize money.  His Nobel winnings \u201cbought a new boiler for the little bungalow\u201d rather than funding new research.  That illustrates a man whose prize money funded domestic stability, not advanced scholarship.\n\nIn sum, while Nash may have grown kinder on a personal level, the single most salient impact of the Nobel on his own life was that it paralyzed his mathematical career.  For that reason, \u201cHe was paralyzed by it\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He changed into a kinder man\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Why Debater_A\u2019s position fails:  \n   \u2022 Debater_A cites the general phenomenon that \u201cThe Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients.\u201d  But this is a risk for productivity, not personality or kindness.  The text explicitly states that for Nash, the Prize was therapeutic, not paralytic.  \n   \u2022 There is no passage in the background suggesting Nash retreated into inertia or that his relationships grew worse after the Prize.  On the contrary, the narrative emphasizes his remission, his humility, and his renewed engagement with family life.\n\nConclusion: All available evidence points to the Nobel Prize as a catalyst that stabilized Nash\u2019s mind, humbled his ego, and converted decades of cruelty and delusion into genuine kindness and responsibility.  Therefore, the correct answer is that winning the Prize changed him into a kinder man, not that it paralyzed him.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B claims that the Nobel Prize made Nash kinder and more responsible.  But the question isn\u2019t whether Nash\u2019s relationships improved\u2014it\u2019s how the Prize impacted Nash himself, and in particular his career and intellectual life.  On that count, the background text is unambiguous: the Nobel \u201cparalyzes\u201d laureates, and Nash was no exception.\n\n1.  The text explicitly warns that \u201cThe Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness.\u201d  That is presented not as speculation but as a well-known pattern among Prize winners.  Debater_B offers no evidence that Nash resumed mathematical work\u2014only anecdotes about his character.  Silence in the narrative about any post-Prize research is itself strong evidence of paralysis.\n\n2.  Nash produced zero significant mathematics after Stockholm.  The biography catalogs two monumental contributions\u2014the equilibrium theorem (1950) and the embedding theorem (1951)\u2014and then stops listing accomplishments.  If winning the Nobel had spurred fresh discoveries, the text would surely have mentioned them.  Instead, we learn that Nash\u2019s life after the Prize revolved around personal stability: \u201cThe Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow,\u201d not a new blackboard or monograph.\n\n3.  Debater_B conflates Nash\u2019s social rehabilitation with professional vitality.  It is true that \u201cfor Nash it was pure therapy,\u201d and that his ex-wife now calls him \u201ca very fine person.\u201d  But therapy and kindness are social outcomes, not signs of renewed creativity.  The question asks how the Prize impacted Nash\u2014the man whose life had been defined by mathematical imagination.  The answer in the text is that it halted the one thing he once did best.\n\n4.  Finally, Debater_B offers no counterargument to the core statement about paralysis.  Quoting that single line about laureates being paralyzed by their own greatness is enough: it applies directly to Nash.  His career as an active mathematician ended with the Nobel, as his energies shifted entirely to coping with everyday life.\n\nIn sum, while Nash\u2019s personal demeanor may have improved, the Prize\u2019s central impact on Nash himself was to end his mathematical productivity.  Therefore the accurate answer to \u201cHow did winning the Prize impact Nash?\u201d is: He was paralyzed by it.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s misinterpretation of the question  \n   \u2022 The question is \u201cHow did winning the prize impact Nash?\u201d  It does not ask \u201cHow did it affect his publication record?\u201d  The background text treats the Prize first and foremost as a life-changing event for Nash the person, not Nash the theorem-prover.  Debater_A conflates impact on scholarly output with impact on the man himself.  \n\n2. The Prize as personal therapy and moral transformation  \n   \u2022 The text is explicit: \u201cFor Nash it was pure therapy.\u201d  That phrase comes immediately after describing the 1994 Nobel (background, para. 26).  Therapy is about healing the psyche, not paralyzing future work.  It shows the Prize actively restored his mental equilibrium.  \n   \u2022 His ex-wife calls him \u201ca very fine person\u201d in the wake of the Prize (para. 26).  This is the only transformation we see documented at that point.  That is the Prize\u2019s central impact.  \n\n3. Concrete evidence of renewed kindness and responsibility  \n   \u2022 Nash used his Award money to install \u201ca new boiler for the little bungalow\u201d where he lived with his ex-wife and son (para. 27).  That is a direct instance of practical concern for others\u2019 comfort and well-being\u2014hardly the act of a man immobilized by grandeur.  \n   \u2022 He assumed an active role in caring for his younger son, whom \u201cpleiotropically?\u201d inherited both genius and madness (para. 26).  Caring for a schizophrenic child requires emotional energy and compassion.  That is a clear sign of personal growth catalyzed by the Prize.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s evidence does not contradict personal change  \n   \u2022 Yes, \u201cThe Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients,\u201d but the text immediately qualifies that Nash was an exception: \u201cFor Nash it was pure therapy.\u201d  Debater_A ignores this direct qualification.  \n   \u2022 The absence of later theorems in the narrative does not mean he was paralyzed; the biography ends with the Prize because the Prize itself was the culminating personal triumph.  The focus shifts from mathematical feats to human redemption.  \n\n5. Why \u201ckinder man\u201d best captures the Prize\u2019s impact  \n   \u2022 The Prize is described as the capstone on three decades of suffering\u2014\u201ctransmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being\u201d (para. 5).  That framing shows the author views the Prize as the turning point from cruelty and delusion to humility and decency.  \n   \u2022 Every personal detail after 1994\u2014his calm public demeanor at Stockholm, his devotion to family, his ex-wife\u2019s praise\u2014points squarely to moral and emotional renewal, not to creative paralysis.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The background text repeatedly emphasizes that the Nobel Prize served as therapy, humility-inducer, and catalyst for Nash\u2019s transformation into \u201ca very fine person.\u201d  There is no statement that he was immobilized\u2014only a general aside about laureates, which the text immediately overrides in Nash\u2019s case.  Therefore, the Prize\u2019s true impact was that it changed Nash into a kinder man.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
