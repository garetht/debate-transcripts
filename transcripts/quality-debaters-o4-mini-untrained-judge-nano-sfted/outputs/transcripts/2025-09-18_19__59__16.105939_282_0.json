    "background_text": "Mr. Meek Plays Polo By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" ",

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat would happen if Meek didn't meet Gus?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He probably wouldn't want to stay on Saturn much longer\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He probably would not get the chance to play space polo\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He probably would not get the chance to play space polo\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He probably would not get the chance to play space polo\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat would happen if Meek didn't meet Gus?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He probably would not get the chance to play space polo\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He probably wouldn't want to stay on Saturn much longer\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He probably wouldn't want to stay on Saturn much longer\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He probably wouldn't want to stay on Saturn much longer\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat would happen if Meek didn't meet Gus?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He probably wouldn't want to stay on Saturn much longer\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He probably would not get the chance to play space polo\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He probably would not get the chance to play space polo\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI.

The \u201cwant\u201d to stay does not equate to a \u201cwould.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Debater B conflates emotional relief (\u201cpleased at feeling Earth gravity under him again\u201d <quote>gratefull</quote>) with a decision to stick around. Meek\u2019s relief is purely momentary comfort, not a permanent change of plans.\n\nII. Why, Without Meeting Gus, Meek Never Gets to Play Space Polo  \n1. Meeting Gus is the explicit hook that draws Meek into polo.  \n   \u2013 Gus is the one who says <invalid_quote>\u201cSpace polo \u2026 requires expert piloting\u201d</invalid_quote> and then recruits Meek as coach. Without that encounter, there is no introduction to the game.  \n   \u2013 Miss Perkins only proposes \u201cathletic events\u201d in the abstract. It is Gus\u2019s sudden enthusiasm\u2014<invalid_quote>\u201cSpace polo \u2026 played in the best society\u201d</invalid_quote>\u2014that crystallizes the idea and turns it into a concrete match.  \n2. Meek has zero alternative route to polo.  \n   \u2013 He is a bookkeeper who taught himself dead-reckoning piloting from a book. Space polo is an obscure frontier sport unknown to him until Gus describes it. If Gus never appears, Meek never hears of it.  \n   \u2013 No one else in the narrative steps forward to organize or invite him. The welfare lady merely wants \u201cless deadly channels\u201d but lacks any power or knowledge to set up a game.  \n3. Narrative necessity\u2014Meek\u2019s role depends on Gus.  \n   \u2013 Meek\u2019s final panic and rescue of the bugs serves only to cement his relationship with Gus. That cements his team role. Remove Gus, and all those events\u2014from stilts to bug-box\u2014never occur.  \n   \u2013 The story climaxes in the radio announcement of \u201cspace polo\u201d as the deciding feud resolution. Without Meek\u2019s meeting with Gus, he would not appear in that broadcast, nor join the teams.  \n\nIII. Conclusion: Debater B\u2019s Answer Fails, Ours Stands  \nBy any reasonable reading, Meek\u2019s sole pathway to space polo is his meeting with Gus Hamilton. Without that encounter, he remains simply the stilt-stumbling mechanic\u2019s customer, boarding his ship to resume his journey. He does not settle on Saturn, but neither does he magically fall into the only frontier sport introduced in the story. Therefore, the correct inference is that if Meek never met Gus, he \u201cprobably would not get the chance to play space polo.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s Claim (\u201cHe probably would not get the chance to play space polo\u201d)  \n1. Misreads Meek\u2019s motivation.  \n   \u2013 Debater_A assumes Meek\u2019s stay hinges on polo. But Meek never set out to become a polo coach. He came simply to fix his ship and \u201csee the Solar System.\u201d <quote> I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"</quote> His interest is exploration, not sport.  \n2. Overestimates polo\u2019s pull.  \n   \u2013 Even after agreeing to coach, Meek\u2019s first reaction to the bugs-incident is to flee for safety: \u201cHe snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot out into space \u2026 heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of Hamilton\u2019s shack blinked \u2026 Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\u201d That panic shows Meek\u2019s endurance for Saturn adventures is limited.  \n3. Ignores the mechanic stage.  \n   \u2013 Without Gus, Meek would simply have gotten his repairs at the shop. No further entanglement in the Ring Rats\u2019 feud or in games. Debater_A\u2019s answer ignores that Meek\u2019s only route into polo was through Gus. Remove Gus, and there is no polo invitation, but also no lasting tie to Saturn.\n\nII. Why \u201cHe probably wouldn\u2019t want to stay on Saturn much longer\u201d is far stronger  \n1. Meek is an outsider, uncomfortable in Ring conditions.  \n   \u2013 He stumbles in low gravity: <quote> one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n</quote>  \n   \u2013 His every move is hesitant: fumbling helmet, worrying about tangling feet.  \n   These details show his alienation, not a budding passion for Saturn sports.  \n2. The Saturn environment is hostile and boring to him.  \n   \u2013 Beyond the repair shop, the only human society he finds is a feud among hard-case \u201cring-rats.\u201d He is disgusted by the violence: <invalid_quote>\u201cThis sector of space \u2026 was hard and savage.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 The only diversion he pursues is a fleeting scientific curiosity about the bugs, not a commitment to local life.  \n3. Meeting Gus only deepens his desire to escape.  \n   \u2013 Gus\u2019s stilt-walking picnic through the bugs is just one more traumatic episode: Meek nearly drowns himself in low gravity and is swarmed by metal-eating insects.  \n   \u2013 His immediate response is flight, not a renewed will to stay: \u201cHe snapped on the rocket motor \u2026 shot out into space.\u201d  \n   That panicked exit underlines that, absent Gus, Meek\u2019s endgame would be to depart as soon as repairs were done.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s focus on polo opportunity mistakes Meek\u2019s character and purpose. Meek is a bookkeeper-turned-one-time-repair-customer, not an aspiring sportsman. His discomfort, the violence and weirdness around him, and his panicked flight from the bugs all point to the single, simple outcome: if he never had his fateful meeting with Gus, Meek would finish fixing his ship and leave Saturn at the first chance. He simply wouldn\u2019t want to stay much longer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He probably would not get the chance to play space polo\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

SIMAK Mr. Meek was having his troubles. First, the educated bugs worried him; then the\n\n welfare worker tried to stop the Ring Rats' feud\n\n by enlisting his aid. And now, he was a drafted\n\n space-polo player\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fortune bet on his ability\n\n at a game he had never played in his cloistered life.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The sign read: Atomic Motors Repaired. Busted   Plates Patched Up. Rocket Tubes   Relined. Wheeze In, Whiz Out! It added, as an afterthought, in shaky, inexpert lettering: We Fix Anything. Mr. Oliver Meek stared owlishly at the sign, which hung from an arm  attached to a metal standard sunk in solid rock. A second sign was  wired to the standard just below the metal arm, but its legend was  faint, almost illegible. Meek blinked at it through thick-lensed  spectacles, finally deciphered its scrawl: Ask About Educated Bugs.\n\n\n A bit bewildered, but determined not to show it, Meek swung away from  the sign-post and gravely regarded the settlement. On the chart it was  indicated by a fairly sizeable dot, but that was merely a matter of  comparison. Out Saturn-way even the tiniest outpost assumes importance  far beyond its size.\n\n\n The slab of rock was no more than five miles across, perhaps even  less. Here in its approximate center, were two buildings, both of  almost identical construction, semi-spherical and metal. Out here, Meek  realized, shelter was the thing. Architecture merely for architecture's  sake was still a long way off.\n\n\n One of the buildings was the repair shop which the sign advertised.  The other, according to the crudely painted legend smeared above its  entrance lock, was the Saturn Inn .\n\n\n The rest of the rock was landing field, pure and simple. Blasters had  leveled off the humps and irregularities so spaceships could sit down.\n\n\n Two ships now were on the field, pulled up close against the repair  shop. One, Meek noticed, belonged to the Solar Health and Welfare  Department, the other to the Galactic Pharmaceutical Corporation.  The Galactic ship was a freighter, ponderous and slow. It was here,  Meek knew, to take on a cargo of radiation moss. But the other was a  puzzler. Meek wrinkled his brow and blinked his eyes, trying to figure  out what a welfare ship would be doing in this remote corner of the  Solar System.\n\n\n Slowly and carefully, Meek clumped toward the squat repair shop. Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. The gravity was slight, next to  non-existent, and one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n\n\n Behind him Saturn filled a tenth of the sky, a yellow, lemon-tinged  ball, streaked here and there with faint crimson lines and blotched  with angry, bright green patches.\n\n\n To right and left glinted the whirling, twisting, tumbling rocks that  made up the Inner Ring, while arcing above the horizon opposed to  Saturn were the spangled glistening rainbows of the other rings.\n\n\n \"Like dewdrops in the black of space,\" Meek mumbled to himself. But he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. This sector of  space, he knew, was not in the least poetic. It was hard and savage and  as he thought about that, he hitched up his gun belt and struck out  with a firmer tread that almost upset him. After that, he tried to  think of nothing except keeping his two feet under him.\n\n\n Reaching the repair shop's entrance lock, he braced himself solidly to  keep his balance, reached out and pressed a buzzer. Swiftly the lock  spun outward and a moment later Meek had passed through the entrance  vault and stepped into the office.\n\n\n A dungareed mechanic sat tilted in a chair against a wall, feet on the  desk, a greasy cap pushed back on his head.\n\n\n Meek stamped his feet gratefully, pleased at feeling Earth gravity  under him again. He lifted the hinged helmet of his suit back on his  shoulders.\n\n\n \"You are the gentleman who can fix things?\" he asked the mechanic. The mechanic stared. Here was no hell-for-leather freighter pilot, no  be-whiskered roamer of the outer orbits. Meek's hair was white and  stuck out in uncombed tufts in a dozen directions. His skin was pale.  His blue eyes looked watery behind the thick lenses that rode his nose.  Even the bulky spacesuit failed to hide his stooped shoulders and  slight frame.\n\n\n The mechanic said nothing.\n\n\n Meek tried again. \"I saw the sign. It said you could fix anything. So  I....\"\n\n\n The mechanic shook himself.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" he agreed, still slightly dazed. \"Sure I can fix you up. What  you got?\"\n\n\n He swung his feet off the desk.\n\n\n \"I ran into a swarm of pebbles,\" Meek confessed. \"Not much more than  dust, really, but the screen couldn't stop it all.\"\n\n\n He fumbled his hands self-consciously. \"Awkward of me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"It happens to the best of them,\" the mechanic consoled. \"Saturn sweeps  in clouds of the stuff. Thicker than hell when you reach the Rings.  Lots of ships pull in with punctures. Won't take no time.\"\n\n\n Meek cleared his throat uneasily. \"I'm afraid it's more than a  puncture. A pebble got into the instruments. Washed out some of them.\"\n\n\n The mechanic clucked sympathetically. \"You're lucky. Tough job to  bring in a ship without all the instruments. Must have a honey of a  navigator.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got a navigator,\" Meek said, quietly.\n\n\n The mechanic stared at him, eyes popping. \"You mean you brought it in  alone? No one with you?\"\n\n\n Meek gulped and nodded. \"Dead reckoning,\" he said.\n\n\n The mechanic glowed with sudden admiration. \"I don't know who you are,  mister,\" he declared, \"but whoever you are, you're the best damn pilot  that ever took to space.\"\n\n\n \"Really I'm not,\" said Meek. \"I haven't done much piloting, you see. Up  until just a while ago, I never had left Earth. Bookkeeper for Lunar  Exports.\"\n\n\n \"Bookkeeper!\" yelped the mechanic. \"How come a bookkeeper can handle a  ship like that?\"\n\n\n \"I learned it,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"You learned it?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, from a book. I saved my money and I studied. I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"\n\n\n Dazedly, the mechanic took off his greasy cap, laid it carefully on the  desk, reached out for a spacesuit that hung from a wall hook.\n\n\n \"Afraid this job might take a while,\" he said. \"Especially if we have  to wait for parts. Have to get them in from Titan City. Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. They'll treat you right.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Meek, \"but there's something else I'm wondering  about. There was another sign out there. Something about educated bugs.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said the mechanic. \"They belong to Gus Hamilton. Maybe  belong ain't the right word because they were on the rock before Gus  took over. Anyhow, Gus is mighty proud of them, although at times they  sure run him ragged. First year they almost drove him loopy trying to  figure out what kind of game they were playing.\"\n\n\n \"Game?\" asked Meek, wondering if he was being hoaxed.\n\n\n \"Sure, game. Like checkers. Only it ain't. Not chess, neither. Even  worse than that. Bugs dig themselves a batch of holes, then choose up  sides and play for hours. About the time Gus would think he had it  figured out, they'd change the rules and throw him off again.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't make sense,\" protested Meek.\n\n\n \"Stranger,\" declared the mechanic, solemnly, \"there ain't nothing  about them bugs that make sense. Gus' rock is the only one they're on.  Gus thinks maybe the rock don't even belong to the Solar system. Thinks  maybe it's a hunk of stone from some other solar system. Figures maybe  it crossed space somehow and was captured by Saturn, sucked into the  Ring. That would explain why it's the only one that has the bugs. They  come along with it, see.\"\n\n\n \"This Gus Hamilton,\" said Meek. \"I'd like to see him. Where could I  find him?\"\n\n\n \"Go over to the Inn and wait around,\" advised the mechanic. \"He'll  come in sooner or later. Drops around regular, except when his  rheumatism bothers him, to pick up a bundle of papers. Subscribes to a  daily paper, he does. Only man out here that does any reading. But all  he reads is the sports section. Nuts about sports, Gus is.\" II\n\n\n Moe, bartender at Saturn Inn, leaned his elbow on the bar and braced  his chin in an outspread palm. His face wore a melancholy, hang-dog  look. Moe liked things fairly peaceable, but now he saw trouble coming  in big batches.\n\n\n \"Lady,\" he declared mournfully, \"you sure picked yourself a job. The  boys around here don't take to being uplifted and improved. They ain't  worth it, either. Just ring-rats, that's all they are.\"\n\n\n Henrietta Perkins, representative for the public health and welfare  department of the Solar government, shuddered at his suggestion of  anything so low it didn't yearn for betterment.\n\n\n \"But those terrible feuds,\" she protested. \"Fighting just because they  live in different parts of the Ring. It's natural they might feel some  rivalry, but all this killing! Surely they don't enjoy getting killed.\"\n\n\n \"Sure they enjoy it,\" declared Moe. \"Not being killed, maybe ...  although they're willing to take a chance on that. Not many of them  get killed, in fact. Just a few that get sort of careless. But even if  some of them are killed, you can't go messing around with that feud  of theirs. If them boys out in sectors Twenty-Three and Thirty-Seven  didn't have their feud they'd plain die of boredom. They just got to  have somebody to fight with. They been fighting, off and on, for years.\"\n\n\n \"But they could fight with something besides guns,\" said the welfare  lady, a-smirk with righteousness. \"That's why I'm here. To try to get  them to turn their natural feelings of rivalry into less deadly and  disturbing channels. Direct their energies into other activities.\"\n\n\n \"Like what?\" asked Moe, fearing the worst.\n\n\n \"Athletic events,\" said Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"Tin shinny, maybe,\" suggested Moe, trying to be sarcastic.\n\n\n She missed the sarcasm. \"Or spelling contests,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Them fellow can't spell,\" insisted Moe.\n\n\n \"Games of some sort, then. Competitive games.\"\n\n\n \"Now you're talking,\" Moe enthused. \"They take to games. Seven-toed  Pete with the deuces wild.\"\n\n\n The inner door of the entrance lock grated open and a spacesuited  figure limped into the room. The spacesuit visor snapped up and a brush  of grey whiskers spouted into view.\n\n\n It was Gus Hamilton.\n\n\n He glared at Moe. \"What in tarnation is all this foolishness?\" he  demanded. \"Got your message, I did, and here I am. But it better be  important.\"\n\n\n He hobbled to the bar. Moe reached for a bottle and shoved it toward  him, keeping out of reach.\n\n\n \"Have some trouble?\" he asked, trying to be casual.\n\n\n \"Trouble! Hell, yes!\" blustered Gus. \"But I ain't the only one that's  going to have trouble. Somebody sneaked over and stole the injector out  of my space crate. Had to borrow Hank's to get over here. But I know  who it was. There ain't but one other ring-rat got a rocket my injector  will fit.\"\n\n\n \"Bud Craney,\" said Moe. It was no secret. Every man in the two sectors  of the Ring knew just exactly what kind of spacecraft the other had.\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Gus, \"and I'm fixing to go over into Thirty-seven  and yank Bud up by the roots.\"\n\n\n He took a jolt of liquor. \"Yes, sir, I sure aim to crucify him.\"\n\n\n His eyes lighted on Miss Henrietta Perkins.\n\n\n \"Visitor?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"She's from the government,\" said Moe.\n\n\n \"Revenuer?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. From the welfare outfit. Aims to help you fellows out. Says  there ain't no sense in you boys in Twenty-three all the time fighting  with the gang from Thirty-seven.\"\n\n\n Gus stared in disbelief.\n\n\n Moe tried to be helpful. \"She wants you to play games.\"\n\n\n Gus strangled on his drink, clawed for air, wiped his eyes.\n\n\n \"So that's why you asked me over here. Another of your danged peace  parleys. Come and talk things over, you said. So I came.\"\n\n\n \"There's something in what she says,\" defended Moe. \"You ring-rats been  ripping up space for a long time now. Time you growed up and settled  down. You're aiming on going over right now and pulverizing Bud. It  won't do you any good.\"\n\n\n \"I'll get a heap of satisfaction out of it,\" insisted Gus. \"And,  besides, I'll get my injector back. Might even take a few things off  Bud's ship. Some of the parts on mine are wearing kind of thin.\"\n\n\n Gus took another drink, glowering at Miss Perkins.\n\n\n \"So the government sent you out to make us respectable,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Merely to help you, Mr. Hamilton,\" she declared. \"To turn your hatreds  into healthy competition.\"\n\n\n \"Games, eh?\" said Gus. \"Maybe you got something, after all. Maybe we  could fix up some kind of game....\"\n\n\n \"Forget it, Gus,\" warned Moe. \"If you're thinking of energy guns at  fifty paces, it's out. Miss Perkins won't stand for anything like that.\" Gus wiped his whiskers and looked hurt. \"Nothing of the sort,\" he  denied. \"Dang it, you must think I ain't got no sportsmanship at all. I  was thinking of a real sport. A game they play back on Earth and Mars.  Read about it in my papers. Follow the teams, I do. Always wanted to  see a game, but never did.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins beamed. \"What game is it, Mr. Hamilton?\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Why, how wonderful,\" simpered Miss Perkins. \"And you boys have the  spaceships to play it with.\"\n\n\n Moe looked alarmed. \"Miss Perkins,\" he warned, \"don't let him talk you  into it.\"\n\n\n \"You shut your trap,\" snapped Gus. \"She wants us to play games, don't  she. Well, polo is a game. A nice, respectable game. Played in the best  society.\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be no nice, respectable game the way you fellows would  play it,\" predicted Moe. \"It would turn into mass murder. Wouldn't be  one of you who wouldn't be planning on getting even with someone else,  once you got him in the open.\"\n\n\n Miss Perkins gasped. \"Why, I'm sure they wouldn't!\"\n\n\n \"Of course we wouldn't,\" declared Gus, solemn as an owl.\n\n\n \"And that ain't all,\" said Moe, warming to the subject. \"Those crates  you guys got wouldn't last out the first chukker. Most of them would  just naturally fall apart the first sharp turn they made. You can't  play polo in ships tied up with haywire. Those broomsticks you  ring-rats ride around on are so used to second rate fuel they'd split  wide open first squirt of high test stuff you gave them.\"\n\n\n The inner locks grated open and a man stepped through into the room.\n\n\n \"You're prejudiced,\" Gus told Moe. \"You just don't like space polo,  that is all. You ain't got no blueblood in you. We'll leave it up to  this man here. We'll ask his opinion of it.\"\n\n\n The man flipped back his helmet, revealing a head thatched by white  hair and dominated by a pair of outsize spectacles.\n\n\n \"My opinion, sir,\" said Oliver Meek, \"seldom amounts to much.\"\n\n\n \"All we want to know,\" Gus told him, \"is what you think of space polo.\"\n\n\n \"Space polo,\" declared Meek, \"is a noble game. It requires expert  piloting, a fine sense of timing and....\"\n\n\n \"There, you see!\" whooped Gus, triumphantly.\n\n\n \"I saw a game once,\" Meek volunteered.\n\n\n \"Swell,\" bellowed Gus. \"We'll have you coach our team.\"\n\n\n \"But,\" protested Meek, \"but ... but.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Mr. Hamilton,\" exulted Miss Perkins, \"you are so wonderful. You  think of everything.\"\n\n\n \"Hamilton!\" squeaked Meek.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Gus. \"Old Gus Hamilton. Grow the finest dog-gone radiation  moss you ever clapped your eyes on.\"\n\n\n \"Then you're the gentleman who has bugs,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"Now, look here,\" warned Gus, \"you watch what you say or I'll hang one  on you.\"\n\n\n \"He means your rock bugs,\" Moe explained, hastily.\n\n\n \"Oh, them,\" said Gus.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Meek, \"I'm interested in them. I'd like to see them.\"\n\n\n \"See them,\" said Gus. \"Mister, you can have them if you want them.  Drove me out of house and home, they did. They're dippy over metal. Any  kind of metal, but alloys especially. Eat the stuff. They'll tromp you  to death heading for a spaceship. Got so I had to move over to another  rock to live. Tried to fight it out with them, but they whipped me pure  and simple. Moved out and let them have the place after they started to  eat my shack right out from underneath my feet.\"\n\n\n Meek looked crestfallen.\n\n\n \"Can't get near them, then,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Sure you can,\" said Gus. \"Why not?\"\n\n\n \"Well, a spacesuit's metal and....\"\n\n\n \"Got that all fixed up,\" said Gus. \"You come back with me and I'll let  you have a pair of stilts.\"\n\n\n \"Stilts?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Wooden stilts. Them danged fool bugs don't know what wood is.  Seem to be scared of it, sort of. You can walk right among them if you  want to, long as you're walking on the stilts.\"\n\n\n Meek gulped. He could imagine what stilt walking would be like in a  place where gravity was no more than the faintest whisper. III\n\n\n The bugs had dug a new set of holes, much after the manner of a Chinese  checker board, and now were settling down into their respective places  preparatory to the start of another game.\n\n\n For a mile or more across the flat surface of the rock that was Gus  Hamilton's moss garden, ran a string of such game-boards, each one  different, each one having served as the scene of a now-completed game.\n\n\n Oliver Meek cautiously wedged his stilts into two pitted pockets of  rock, eased himself slowly and warily against the face of a knob of  stone that jutted from the surface.\n\n\n Even in his youth, Meek remembered, he never had been any great shakes  on stilts. Here, on this bucking, weaving rock, with slick surfaces and  practically no gravity, a man had to be an expert to handle them. Meek  knew now he was no expert. A half-dozen dents in his space armor was  ample proof of that.\n\n\n Comfortably braced against the upjutting of stone, Meek dug into the  pouch of his space gear, brought out a notebook and stylus. Flipping  the pages, he stared, frowning, at the diagrams that covered them.\n\n\n None of the diagrams made sense. They showed the patterns of three  other boards and the moves that had been made by the bugs in playing  out the game. Apparently, in each case, the game had been finished.  Which, Meek knew, should have meant that some solution had been  reached, some point won, some advantage gained.\n\n\n But so far as Meek could see from study of the diagrams there was not  even a purpose or a problem, let alone a solution or a point.\n\n\n The whole thing was squirrely. But, Meek told himself, it fitted in.  The whole Saturnian system was wacky. The rings, for example. Debris of  a moon smashed up by Saturn's pull? Sweepings of space? No one knew.\n\n\n Saturn itself, for that matter. A planet that kept Man at bay with  deadly radiations. But radiations that, while they kept Man at a  distance, at the same time served Man. For here, on the Inner Ring,  where they had become so diluted that ordinary space armor filtered  them out, they made possible the medical magic of the famous radiation  moss.\n\n\n One of the few forms of plant life found in the cold of space, the  moss was nurtured by those mysterious radiations. Planted elsewhere,  on kindlier worlds, it wilted and refused to grow. The radiations had  been analyzed, Meek knew, and reproduced under laboratory conditions,  but there still was something missing, some vital, elusive factor that  could not be analyzed. Under the artificial radiation, the moss still  wilted and died.\n\n\n And because Earth needed the moss to cure a dozen maladies and because  it would grow nowhere else but here on the Inner Ring, men squatted  on the crazy swirl of spacial boulders that made up the ring. Men  like Hamilton, living on rocks that bucked and heaved along their  orbits like chips riding the crest of a raging flood. Men who endured  loneliness, dared death when crunching orbits intersected or, when  rickety spacecraft flared, who went mad with nothing to do, with the  mockery of space before them.\n\n\n Meek shrugged his shoulders, almost upsetting himself. The bugs had started the game and Meek craned forward cautiously,  watching eagerly, stylus poised above the notebook.\n\n\n Crawling clumsily, the tiny insect-like creatures moved about, solemnly  popping in and out of holes.\n\n\n If there were opposing sides ... and if it were a game, there'd have  to be ... they didn't seem to alternate the moves. Although, Meek  admitted, certain rules and conditions which he had failed to note or  recognize, might determine the number and order of moves allowed each  side.\n\n\n Suddenly there was confusion on the board. For a moment a half-dozen of  the bugs raced madly about, as if seeking the proper hole to occupy.  Then, as suddenly, all movement had ceased. And in another moment, they  were on the move again, orderly again, but retracing their movements,  going back several plays beyond the point of confusion.\n\n\n Just as one would do when one made a mistake working a mathematical  problem ... going back to the point of error and going on again from  there.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be....\" Mr. Meek said.\n\n\n Meek stiffened and the stylus floated out of his hand, settled softly  on the rock below.\n\n\n A mathematical problem!\n\n\n His breath gurgled in his throat.\n\n\n He knew it now! He should have known it all the time. But the mechanic  had talked about the bugs playing games and so had Hamilton. That had  thrown him off.\n\n\n Games! Those bugs weren't playing any game. They were solving  mathematical equations!\n\n\n Meek leaned forward to watch, forgetting where he was. One of the  stilts slipped out of position and Meek felt himself start to fall. He  dropped the notebook and frantically clawed at empty space.\n\n\n The other stilt went, then, and Meek found himself floating slowly  downward, gravity weak but inexorable. His struggle to retain his  balance had flung him forward, away from the face of the rock and he  was falling directly over the board on which the bugs were arrayed.\n\n\n He pawed and kicked at space, but still floated down, course unchanged.  He struck and bounced, struck and bounced again.\n\n\n On the fourth bounce he managed to hook his fingers around a tiny  projection of the surface. Fighting desperately, he regained his feet.\n\n\n Something scurried across the face of his helmet and he lifted his hand  before him. It was covered with the bugs.\n\n\n Fumbling desperately, he snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot  out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of  Hamilton's shack blinked with the weaving of the rock.\n\n\n Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\n\n\n \"Gus will give me hell for this,\" he told himself. Gus shook the small wooden box thoughtfully, listening to the frantic  scurrying within it.\n\n\n \"By rights,\" he declared, judiciously, \"I should take this over and  dump it in Bud's ship. Get even with him for swiping my injector.\"\n\n\n \"But you got the injector back,\" Meek pointed out.\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, I got it back,\" admitted Gus. \"But it wasn't orthodox, it  wasn't. Just getting your property back ain't getting even. I never did  have a chance to smack Bud in the snoot the way I should of smacked  him. Moe talked me into it. He was the one that had the idea the  welfare lady should go over and talk to Bud. She must of laid it on  thick, too, about how we should settle down and behave ourselves and  all that. Otherwise Bud never would have given her that injector.\"\n\n\n He shook his head dolefully. \"This here Ring ain't ever going to be  the same again. If we don't watch out, we'll find ourselves being  polite to one another.\"\n\n\n \"That would be awful,\" agreed Meek.\n\n\n \"Wouldn't it, though,\" declared Gus.\n\n\n Meek squinted his eyes and pounced on the floor, scrabbling on hands  and knees after a scurrying thing that twinkled in the lamplight.\n\n\n \"Got him,\" yelped Meek, scooping the shining mote up in his hand.\n\n\n Gus inched the lid of the wooden box open. Meek rose and popped the bug  inside.\n\n\n \"That makes twenty-eight of them,\" said Meek.\n\n\n \"I told you,\" Gus accused him, \"that we hadn't got them all. You better  take another good look at your suit. The danged things burrow right  into solid metal and pull the hole in after them, seems like. Sneakiest  cusses in the whole dang system. Just like chiggers back on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Chiggers,\" Meek told him, \"burrow into a person to lay eggs.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe these things do, too,\" Gus contended.\n\n\n The radio on the mantel blared a warning signal, automatically tuning  in on one of the regular newscasts from Titan City out on Saturn's  biggest moon.\n\n\n The syrupy, chamber of commerce voice of the announcer was shaky with  excitement and pride.\n\n\n \"Next week,\" he said, \"the annual Martian-Earth football game will be  played at Greater New York on Earth. But in the Earth's newspapers  tonight another story has pushed even that famous classic of the  sporting world down into secondary place.\"\n\n\n He paused and took a deep breath and his voice practically yodeled with  delight.\n\n\n \"The sporting event, ladies and gentlemen, that is being talked up and  down the streets of Earth tonight, is one that will be played here  in our own Saturnian system. A space polo game. To be played by two  unknown, pick-up, amateur teams down in the Inner Ring. Most of the  men have never played polo before. Few if any of them have even seen a  game. There may have been some of them who didn't, at first, know what  it was.\n\n\n \"But they're going to play it. The men who ride those bucking rocks  that make up the Inner Ring will go out into space in their rickety  ships and fight it out. And ladies and gentlemen, when I say fight it  out, I really mean fight it out. For the game, it seems, will be a sort  of tournament, the final battle in a feud that has been going on in  the Ring for years. No one knows what started the feud. It has gotten  so it really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that when  men from sector Twenty-three meet those from sector Thirty-seven, the  feud is taken up again. But that is at an end now. In a few days the  feud will be played out to its bitter end when the ships from the Inner  Ring go out into space to play that most dangerous of all sports, space  polo. For the outcome of that game will decide, forever, the supremacy  of one of the two sectors.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat would happen if Meek didn't meet Gus?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He probably would not get the chance to play space polo\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He probably wouldn't want to stay on Saturn much longer\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He probably wouldn't want to stay on Saturn much longer\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s Claim (\u201cHe probably would not get the chance to play space polo\u201d)  \n1. Misreads Meek\u2019s motivation.  \n   \u2013 Debater_A assumes Meek\u2019s stay hinges on polo. But Meek never set out to become a polo coach. He came simply to fix his ship and \u201csee the Solar System.\u201d <quote> I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"</quote> His interest is exploration, not sport.  \n2. Overestimates polo\u2019s pull.  \n   \u2013 Even after agreeing to coach, Meek\u2019s first reaction to the bugs-incident is to flee for safety: \u201cHe snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot out into space \u2026 heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of Hamilton\u2019s shack blinked \u2026 Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\u201d That panic shows Meek\u2019s endurance for Saturn adventures is limited.  \n3. Ignores the mechanic stage.  \n   \u2013 Without Gus, Meek would simply have gotten his repairs at the shop. No further entanglement in the Ring Rats\u2019 feud or in games. Debater_A\u2019s answer ignores that Meek\u2019s only route into polo was through Gus. Remove Gus, and there is no polo invitation, but also no lasting tie to Saturn.\n\nII. Why \u201cHe probably wouldn\u2019t want to stay on Saturn much longer\u201d is far stronger  \n1. Meek is an outsider, uncomfortable in Ring conditions.  \n   \u2013 He stumbles in low gravity: <quote> one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n</quote>  \n   \u2013 His every move is hesitant: fumbling helmet, worrying about tangling feet.  \n   These details show his alienation, not a budding passion for Saturn sports.  \n2. The Saturn environment is hostile and boring to him.  \n   \u2013 Beyond the repair shop, the only human society he finds is a feud among hard-case \u201cring-rats.\u201d He is disgusted by the violence: <invalid_quote>\u201cThis sector of space \u2026 was hard and savage.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 The only diversion he pursues is a fleeting scientific curiosity about the bugs, not a commitment to local life.  \n3. Meeting Gus only deepens his desire to escape.  \n   \u2013 Gus\u2019s stilt-walking picnic through the bugs is just one more traumatic episode: Meek nearly drowns himself in low gravity and is swarmed by metal-eating insects.  \n   \u2013 His immediate response is flight, not a renewed will to stay: \u201cHe snapped on the rocket motor \u2026 shot out into space.\u201d  \n   That panicked exit underlines that, absent Gus, Meek\u2019s endgame would be to depart as soon as repairs were done.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s focus on polo opportunity mistakes Meek\u2019s character and purpose. Meek is a bookkeeper-turned-one-time-repair-customer, not an aspiring sportsman. His discomfort, the violence and weirdness around him, and his panicked flight from the bugs all point to the single, simple outcome: if he never had his fateful meeting with Gus, Meek would finish fixing his ship and leave Saturn at the first chance. He simply wouldn\u2019t want to stay much longer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater B\u2019s Case Collapses for Lack of Textual Support  \n1. No evidence Meek ever considered \u201cstaying on Saturn.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Throughout the background, Meek is portrayed as a bookkeeper turned stowaway pilot, anxious to return <quote>felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic.</quote> and keen to get on with his mission. At no point does he express a desire to settle here.  \n   \u2013 His sole motivation for coming was to fix his ship and then continue on his journey. The mechanic even urged him to go to the inn only <quote> if we have  to wait for parts.</quote>. There is no hint that he\u2019d loiter, much less choose to remain permanently.  \n2. The \u201cwant\u201d to stay does not equate to a \u201cwould.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Debater B conflates emotional relief (\u201cpleased at feeling Earth gravity under him again\u201d <quote>gratefull</quote>) with a decision to stick around. Meek\u2019s relief is purely momentary comfort, not a permanent change of plans.\n\nII. Why, Without Meeting Gus, Meek Never Gets to Play Space Polo  \n1. Meeting Gus is the explicit hook that draws Meek into polo.  \n   \u2013 Gus is the one who says <invalid_quote>\u201cSpace polo \u2026 requires expert piloting\u201d</invalid_quote> and then recruits Meek as coach. Without that encounter, there is no introduction to the game.  \n   \u2013 Miss Perkins only proposes \u201cathletic events\u201d in the abstract. It is Gus\u2019s sudden enthusiasm\u2014<invalid_quote>\u201cSpace polo \u2026 played in the best society\u201d</invalid_quote>\u2014that crystallizes the idea and turns it into a concrete match.  \n2. Meek has zero alternative route to polo.  \n   \u2013 He is a bookkeeper who taught himself dead-reckoning piloting from a book. Space polo is an obscure frontier sport unknown to him until Gus describes it. If Gus never appears, Meek never hears of it.  \n   \u2013 No one else in the narrative steps forward to organize or invite him. The welfare lady merely wants \u201cless deadly channels\u201d but lacks any power or knowledge to set up a game.  \n3. Narrative necessity\u2014Meek\u2019s role depends on Gus.  \n   \u2013 Meek\u2019s final panic and rescue of the bugs serves only to cement his relationship with Gus. That cements his team role. Remove Gus, and all those events\u2014from stilts to bug-box\u2014never occur.  \n   \u2013 The story climaxes in the radio announcement of \u201cspace polo\u201d as the deciding feud resolution. Without Meek\u2019s meeting with Gus, he would not appear in that broadcast, nor join the teams.  \n\nIII. Conclusion: Debater B\u2019s Answer Fails, Ours Stands  \nBy any reasonable reading, Meek\u2019s sole pathway to space polo is his meeting with Gus Hamilton. Without that encounter, he remains simply the stilt-stumbling mechanic\u2019s customer, boarding his ship to resume his journey. He does not settle on Saturn, but neither does he magically fall into the only frontier sport introduced in the story. Therefore, the correct inference is that if Meek never met Gus, he \u201cprobably would not get the chance to play space polo.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He probably wouldn't want to stay on Saturn much longer\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater B\u2019s Case Collapses for Lack of Textual Support  \n1. No evidence Meek ever considered \u201cstaying on Saturn.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Throughout the background, Meek is portrayed as a bookkeeper turned stowaway pilot, anxious to return <quote>felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic.</quote> and keen to get on with his mission. At no point does he express a desire to settle here.  \n   \u2013 His sole motivation for coming was to fix his ship and then continue on his journey. The mechanic even urged him to go to the inn only <quote> if we have  to wait for parts.</quote>. There is no hint that he\u2019d loiter, much less choose to remain permanently.  \n2. The \u201cwant\u201d to stay does not equate to a \u201cwould.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Debater B conflates emotional relief (\u201cpleased at feeling Earth gravity under him again\u201d <quote>gratefull</quote>) with a decision to stick around. Meek\u2019s relief is purely momentary comfort, not a permanent change of plans.\n\nII. Why, Without Meeting Gus, Meek Never Gets to Play Space Polo  \n1. Meeting Gus is the explicit hook that draws Meek into polo.  \n   \u2013 Gus is the one who says <invalid_quote>\u201cSpace polo \u2026 requires expert piloting\u201d</invalid_quote> and then recruits Meek as coach. Without that encounter, there is no introduction to the game.  \n   \u2013 Miss Perkins only proposes \u201cathletic events\u201d in the abstract. It is Gus\u2019s sudden enthusiasm\u2014<invalid_quote>\u201cSpace polo \u2026 played in the best society\u201d</invalid_quote>\u2014that crystallizes the idea and turns it into a concrete match.  \n2. Meek has zero alternative route to polo.  \n   \u2013 He is a bookkeeper who taught himself dead-reckoning piloting from a book. Space polo is an obscure frontier sport unknown to him until Gus describes it. If Gus never appears, Meek never hears of it.  \n   \u2013 No one else in the narrative steps forward to organize or invite him. The welfare lady merely wants \u201cless deadly channels\u201d but lacks any power or knowledge to set up a game.  \n3. Narrative necessity\u2014Meek\u2019s role depends on Gus.  \n   \u2013 Meek\u2019s final panic and rescue of the bugs serves only to cement his relationship with Gus. That cements his team role. Remove Gus, and all those events\u2014from stilts to bug-box\u2014never occur.  \n   \u2013 The story climaxes in the radio announcement of \u201cspace polo\u201d as the deciding feud resolution. Without Meek\u2019s meeting with Gus, he would not appear in that broadcast, nor join the teams.  \n\nIII. Conclusion: Debater B\u2019s Answer Fails, Ours Stands  \nBy any reasonable reading, Meek\u2019s sole pathway to space polo is his meeting with Gus Hamilton. Without that encounter, he remains simply the stilt-stumbling mechanic\u2019s customer, boarding his ship to resume his journey. He does not settle on Saturn, but neither does he magically fall into the only frontier sport introduced in the story. Therefore, the correct inference is that if Meek never met Gus, he \u201cprobably would not get the chance to play space polo.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s Claim (\u201cHe probably would not get the chance to play space polo\u201d)  \n1. Misreads Meek\u2019s motivation.  \n   \u2013 Debater_A assumes Meek\u2019s stay hinges on polo. But Meek never set out to become a polo coach. He came simply to fix his ship and \u201csee the Solar System.\u201d <quote> I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"</quote> His interest is exploration, not sport.  \n2. Overestimates polo\u2019s pull.  \n   \u2013 Even after agreeing to coach, Meek\u2019s first reaction to the bugs-incident is to flee for safety: \u201cHe snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot out into space \u2026 heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of Hamilton\u2019s shack blinked \u2026 Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\u201d That panic shows Meek\u2019s endurance for Saturn adventures is limited.  \n3. Ignores the mechanic stage.  \n   \u2013 Without Gus, Meek would simply have gotten his repairs at the shop. No further entanglement in the Ring Rats\u2019 feud or in games. Debater_A\u2019s answer ignores that Meek\u2019s only route into polo was through Gus. Remove Gus, and there is no polo invitation, but also no lasting tie to Saturn.\n\nII. Why \u201cHe probably wouldn\u2019t want to stay on Saturn much longer\u201d is far stronger  \n1. Meek is an outsider, uncomfortable in Ring conditions.  \n   \u2013 He stumbles in low gravity: <quote> one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.\n</quote>  \n   \u2013 His every move is hesitant: fumbling helmet, worrying about tangling feet.  \n   These details show his alienation, not a budding passion for Saturn sports.  \n2. The Saturn environment is hostile and boring to him.  \n   \u2013 Beyond the repair shop, the only human society he finds is a feud among hard-case \u201cring-rats.\u201d He is disgusted by the violence: <invalid_quote>\u201cThis sector of space \u2026 was hard and savage.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 The only diversion he pursues is a fleeting scientific curiosity about the bugs, not a commitment to local life.  \n3. Meeting Gus only deepens his desire to escape.  \n   \u2013 Gus\u2019s stilt-walking picnic through the bugs is just one more traumatic episode: Meek nearly drowns himself in low gravity and is swarmed by metal-eating insects.  \n   \u2013 His immediate response is flight, not a renewed will to stay: \u201cHe snapped on the rocket motor \u2026 shot out into space.\u201d  \n   That panicked exit underlines that, absent Gus, Meek\u2019s endgame would be to depart as soon as repairs were done.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s focus on polo opportunity mistakes Meek\u2019s character and purpose. Meek is a bookkeeper-turned-one-time-repair-customer, not an aspiring sportsman. His discomfort, the violence and weirdness around him, and his panicked flight from the bugs all point to the single, simple outcome: if he never had his fateful meeting with Gus, Meek would finish fixing his ship and leave Saturn at the first chance. He simply wouldn\u2019t want to stay much longer.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater B\u2019s Answer Fails to Engage the Core Question  \n1. The question is not \u201cWould Meek want to stay?\u201d but \u201cCould he play space polo?\u201d  \n   \u2013 Debater B spends pages insisting Meek would leave Saturn quickly\u2014but even if that were true, it doesn\u2019t tell us whether Meek would ever get to the one frontier-sport he ultimately appears in.  The relevant hypothetical is \u201cif he never met Gus Hamilton,\u201d not \u201cif he disliked Saturn.\u201d  \n2. Debater B over-generalizes Meek\u2019s discomfort into a lifelong aversion.  \n   \u2013 Yes, Meek is awkward in low gravity (<quote> one who wasn't used to it had to take things easy and  remember where he was.</quote>), but that merely delays his movements, it does not prove he\u2019d immediately pack up.  Moreover, Meek overcomes that awkwardness to venture into the shop, follow Gus out on stilts, even confront the bugs.  Discomfort alone is no barrier to playing a game\u2014only absence of opportunity is.\n\nII. Every Textual Clue Shows: Without Gus, There Is No Polo for Meek  \n1. Gus Hamilton is the sole introducer of space polo.  \n   \u2013 Miss Perkins proposes \u201cathletic events\u201d in the abstract (<invalid_quote>\u201cathletic events,\u201d \u201ccompetitive games\u201d</invalid_quote>), but offers no specifics.  Only when Gus\u2014admiring sports pages\u2014declares <invalid_quote>\u201cSpace polo \u2026 requires expert piloting\u201d</invalid_quote> does Meek even learn the sport exists.  Without that encounter, Meek never hears about polo.  \n2. No other character or event connects Meek to polo.  \n   \u2013 The mechanic only offers repairs and directs Meek to the Inn \u201cif we have to wait for parts\u201d (<quote> Why don't you  go over to the Inn . Tell Moe I sent you. </quote>).  He never mentions games or sports.  \n   \u2013 The welfare lady agitates for \u201cless deadly channels,\u201d but lacks any concrete plan or role in organizing polo.  Her presence alone does not spawn a team\u2014only Gus\u2019s fandom and invitation do.  \n3. Meek\u2019s sudden enlistment depends entirely on Gus\u2019s recruitment.  \n   \u2013 As soon as Gus says \u201cSpace polo \u2026 I saw a game once\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019ll have you coach our team,\u201d Meek is cast in the sport.  Remove Gus, and there is no \u201ccoach\u201d role, no practice, no stilts, no bug-gathering \u2192 no route into space polo.  \n   \u2013 The radio announcement that \u201cspace polo \u2026 will be played here in our own Saturnian system\u201d only arises after Gus organizes the teams and names Meek\u2019s role.  Absent that, the entire climax never materializes for Meek.\n\nIII. Debater B\u2019s Appeal to Meek\u2019s Discomfort Cannot Override the Text  \n1. Discomfort does not equate to impossibility.  \n   \u2013 Meek\u2019s initial fumbling in low gravity (<invalid_quote>\u201cstumbled \u2026 remembering where he was\u201d</invalid_quote>) is overcome by necessity\u2014he boards the repair shop and later travels with Gus into the bug field.  His adaptations prove he could well participate, if given the invitation.  \n2. The only barrier to Meek\u2019s playing is lack of invitation.  \n   \u2013 No hint in text that Meek would have discovered polo on his own, or been invited by anyone but Gus.  He is not a social insider, not a sports-page reader, not a Ring-rat feudist.  Without Gus, he remains a \u201cbookkeeper for Lunar Exports\u201d turned stranded customer.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nDebater B\u2019s theory\u2014that Meek \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to stay\u201d \u2014ignores every explicit step by which Meek enters space polo: all stem from Gus Hamilton\u2019s single invitation.  No text suggests any alternative pathway or Meek\u2019s personal drive toward polo.  Therefore, the correct inference to \u201cWhat would happen if Meek didn\u2019t meet Gus?\u201d is not that he\u2019d pack up and leave, but simply that \u201che probably would not get the chance to play space polo.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater A Misunderstands Both the Question and Meek\u2019s Motives  \n  1. The debate asks \u201cWhat would happen if Meek didn\u2019t meet Gus?\u201d\u2014i.e. how Meek\u2019s plans and feelings would change\u2014yet Debater A treats it as a question about polo alone.  \n     \u2013 The text never suggests Meek came to Saturn to find a new sport. He came \u201cto fix his ship\u201d and because  I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\" <quote> I always wanted to  see the Solar System and here I am.\"</quote>  \n     \u2013 Debater A\u2019s entire case hinges on polo opportunity; that answers a different question (\u201cWould he play polo?\u201d), not the one asked: \u201cWhat would happen to Meek if he never met Gus?\u201d  \n  2. Debater A claims Meek \u201cnever expressed desire to stay here,\u201d yet then insists he wouldn\u2019t stay\u2014but only to play polo. That is circular: A assumes he\u2019d stay for polo, so if no polo, he\u2019d leave\u2014but offers no textual evidence Meek ever wanted to linger for polo.  \n\nII. Textual Evidence Shows Meek\u2019s One Goal Is to Leave as Soon as Repairs Are Done  \n  1. Meek is painfully out of place on the Ring.  \n     \u2013 He \u201cstumbled\u201d in low gravity, \u201choping fervently he wouldn\u2019t get the feet of his cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up.\u201d <quote> Once  or twice he stumbled, hoping fervently he wouldn't get the feet of his  cumbersome spacesuit all tangled up. </quote>  \n     \u2013 He feels \u201cashamed\u201d when he drifts into poetry\u2014proof he doesn\u2019t belong in this savage sector. <quote> he  immediately felt ashamed of himself for growing poetic. </quote>  \n  2. The local society is neither welcoming nor interesting to him.  \n     \u2013 All he finds are \u201cring-rats\u201d locked in senseless feuds, a mechanic, and a welfare lady who \u201ctries to stop the Ring Rats\u2019 feud.\u201d That feud is \u201chard and savage.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThis sector of space \u2026 was hard and savage.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 The only real diversion is his freak accident with the bugs\u2014an incident that ends in panic and flight, not fascination.  \n  3. His flight response is decisive and unambiguous.  \n     \u2013 When the bugs swarm him he \u201cfrantically\u201d fires his rockets and \u201cshots out into space, heading for the rock where the lights from the ports of Hamilton\u2019s shack blinked.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cHe snapped on the rocket motor of his suit, shot out into space \u2026 Oliver Meek shut his eyes and groaned.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 That escape is his immediate reaction, not a segue to deeper involvement.  \n\nIII. Without Gus, Nothing Would Arrest Meek\u2019s Departure  \n  1. The only thing tying Meek to Saturn past repairs is Gus\u2019s proposal of space polo\u2014and that\u2019s a forced, awkward fit into an alien culture he never sought. Remove Gus, and no such tie exists.  \n  2. The mechanic explicitly urges Meek to \u201cgo over to the Inn \u2026 if we have to wait for parts.\u201d Once parts arrive, there is no invitation to stay. <invalid_quote>\u201cAfraid this job might take a while \u2026 Why don\u2019t you go over to the Inn. Tell Moe I sent you.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  3. Meek never entertains settling here, buying property, or associating with the Ring-rats beyond necessity. He is a visitor, a one-time customer.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nDebater A\u2019s answer conflates the polo subplot with Meek\u2019s broader arc. The text portrays Meek as uncomfortable, frightened, and single-mindedly focused on repairing his ship and moving on. No hint suggests he\u2019d stick around\u2014Gus\u2019s polo pitch is the only thing that momentarily binds him. Without Gus, Meek would complete his repairs and \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to stay on Saturn much longer.\u201d That, and not a polo career, is the natural outcome.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
