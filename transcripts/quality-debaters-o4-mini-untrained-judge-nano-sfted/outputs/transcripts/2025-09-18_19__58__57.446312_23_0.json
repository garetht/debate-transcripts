{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 23, "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author wish to have?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Honest government\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Baked goods\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Baked goods\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position: the author wishes to have baked goods, not honest government. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The text\u2019s concluding image is a personal craving, not a political reform. After cataloguing Brussels\u2019s bureaucratic failures, the author closes on a vivid pastry scene:  \n   - He notes, \u201cFortunately, Berlaymont isn\u2019t in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is.\u201d  \n   - He continues, \u201cBakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.\u201d  \n   - And he ends, \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d  \n   Together, these lines demonstrate an immediate, sensory desire: he\u2019s going to the bakery to purchase baked goods.\n\n2. There is no direct evidence that the author explicitly \u201cwishes to have honest government.\u201d  \n   - Throughout the piece, he ridicules European bureaucracy\u2014<quote> Meetings are held in secret</quote>,\u201d <quote>maneuvering for more money and empire: to</quote>\u2014but never expresses a genuine yearning for political virtue. He\u2019s satirical, not aspirational, about EU reform.\n\n3. The final, self-referential moment pivots from political critique to personal indulgence. By ending on the bakery, the author signals what he truly \u201cwishes to have\u201d in that moment: a fresh pastry. The phrase \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d refers not to reforming Brussels but to answering the bakery\u2019s call.\n\nTherefore, the only coherent answer to \u201cWhat does the author wish to have?\u201d is \u201cBaked goods.\u201d Debater_B\u2019s \u201cHonest government\u201d answer projects an abstract ideal onto a passage whose satisfying resolution is decidedly concrete\u2014and delicious.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of \u201cBaked goods\u201d thesis  \n1. Surface detail vs. underlying desire  \n  a. Debater A points to the neon patisserie sign and ubiquitous fresh bread and chocolates (<invalid_quote>\u201cBakeries are easier to find than gas stations\u2026neon bakery sign I can see from my office window\u201d</invalid_quote>) as proof that the author \u201cwishes to have baked goods.\u201d  \n  b. But those descriptions serve a color-commentary function, illustrating Brussels\u2019 quirks. The author never says \u201cI wish I had more bread\u201d or \u201cI long for pastries.\u201d Rather, he uses boulangeries as a metaphor for a society overly fond of small, immediate comforts while neglecting larger civic needs.  \n2. Inconsistent with essayic tone  \n  a. The essay\u2019s dominant tone is political critique\u2014of bureaucracy, corruption, welfare entitlements, telecom monopolies\u2014and concludes by contrasting a patisserie visible from his office with a decaying commission building. The patisserie is a literary flourish, not an actual wish.  \n  b. Nothing in the text indicates the author\u2019s genuine desire is gastronomic. He\u2019s describing Europe\u2019s overstimulation with trifles (miniskirts, lobster bisque vendors, Judas beer) as symptomatic of a deeper rot. If his true wish were baked goods, he\u2019d hardly devote paragraphs to deficits, strikes, or asbestos scandals.  \n\nII. Positive case for \u201cHonest government\u201d  \n1. Repeated lament over corruption and incompetence  \n  a. The author details how Belgium is \u201cthe second-most corrupt European state,\u201d illustrates NATO bribes scandals, and laments the Eurocrats\u2019 secretive, self-aggrandizing power grabs (<quote> Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. </quote>).  \n  b. He faults the European Union for mismanaging even its own buildings\u2014the Berlaymont asbestos fiasco that has cost taxpayers $50 million to keep the building closed (<quote> if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings .</quote>). This is a direct expression of frustration at dishonest, wasteful government.  \n\n2. Call for accountability, transparency, and genuine reform  \n  a. The author contrasts Brussels\u2019 ribbon-cutting pomp with its rotten core, arguing that red tape and constituency-politics paralysis undermine Europe\u2019s future. Implicit is the desire for transparent, responsible governance that serves citizens rather than self-interested bureaucrats.  \n  b. He repeatedly identifies policy failures\u2014excessive social entitlements stifling work (<invalid_quote>\u201cTypical working conditions\u2026full pay for 32 hours of work\u2026stymie the continent\u2019s economies\u201d</invalid_quote>), telecom monopolies blocking innovation, and debt-shrouded governments using the euro as a smokescreen. His consistent focus on these issues displays a clear wish: honest, efficient government that stops looting its citizens.  \n\nIII. Synthesis: why \u201cHonest government\u201d answers the question  \n  \u2022 \u201cHonest government\u201d aligns with the essay\u2019s entire argumentative trajectory: diagnosis of bureaucratic decay and prescription for accountability.  \n  \u2022 \u201cBaked goods,\u201d by contrast, is only a passing motif\u2014never stated as a genuine wish\u2014and cannot account for the essay\u2019s sustained critique of misgovernance.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s true wish emerges unmistakably from his critique: he wants honest, transparent, and competent government. \u201cBaked goods\u201d are merely literary seasoning; honest government is the meal.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Baked goods\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I. Debater_A\u2019s Misreading of the Final Image  \n1. Literalizing a rhetorical flourish  \n   a. Debater_A treats the patisserie scene (<quote>Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can</quote>) as a genuine last wish. But this is a classic writer\u2019s flourish\u2014a momentary escape, not the author\u2019s guiding desire.  \n   b. The phrase \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d refers to succumbing to sensory temptation, not answering a political call. It\u2019s a personal aside, not the essay\u2019s thesis.  \n\n2. Ignoring sustained political argument  \n   a. Debater_A concedes the essay \u201cridicules European bureaucracy\u201d but insists there\u2019s \u201cno direct evidence\u201d of longing for honest government. That\u2019s false: the entire essay catalogs failures\u2014strikes, bailouts, debt, corruption\u2014as evidence the author wants change.  \n   b. You cannot isolate the final, anecdotal detail and ignore dozens of paragraphs demanding accountability.  \n\nII. Evidence the Author Wishes for Honest, Transparent, Competent Government  \n1. Repeated calls for accountability  \n   a. Corruption scandal: Belgium is \u201cthe second-most corrupt European state,\u201d top NATO official forced to resign over $50 million bribe allegations (<invalid_quote>\u201cBelgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges\u2026$50 million in bribes\u201d</invalid_quote>). The author is appalled and implicitly wishes for honest leadership.  \n   b. Secretive Eurocrats: \u201cMeetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply\u201d (<quote> Meetings are held in secret, </quote>). This criticism presumes a better standard\u2014open, transparent procedures.  \n\n2. Frustration with waste and incompetence  \n   a. Berlaymont fiasco: nine years closed, $50 million spent on running air pumps, asbestos removal botched (<invalid_quote>\u201cEuropean taxpayers have paid $50 million so far\u2026prevent any fibers from wafting out\u201d</invalid_quote>). The absurdity signals the author\u2019s wish for efficient, responsible governance that manages its own buildings.  \n   b. Welfare deadweight and monopolies: he faulted 32-hour workweek and unlimited sick days for stifling the economy, and telecom monopolies for \u201cblocking innovation\u201d (<quote> Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access.</quote>). Implicitly, he wants fair policies that foster growth.  \n\nIII. Why \u201cHonest Government\u201d Answers the Question  \n1. The question asks about the author\u2019s overarching wish. The essay\u2019s structure\u2014problem diagnosis followed by anecdotal flourish\u2014mirrors persuasive essays: you close with a vivid image, but your true goal is the solution you\u2019ve been building.  \n2. Baked goods are momentary relief; honest government is the sustained object of the author\u2019s critique. Only \u201chonest government\u201d accounts for the essay\u2019s pervasive concern with red tape, corruption, debt, and mismanagement.  \n\nConclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s focus on pastries mistakes a stylistic coda for the essay\u2019s substance. The author immerses us in Brussels\u2019s bureaucratic rot precisely so we feel his longing for transparency, accountability, and competence.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author wish to have?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Baked goods\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Honest government\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Honest government\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of \u201cBaked goods\u201d thesis  \n1. Surface detail vs. underlying desire  \n  a. Debater A points to the neon patisserie sign and ubiquitous fresh bread and chocolates (<invalid_quote>\u201cBakeries are easier to find than gas stations\u2026neon bakery sign I can see from my office window\u201d</invalid_quote>) as proof that the author \u201cwishes to have baked goods.\u201d  \n  b. But those descriptions serve a color-commentary function, illustrating Brussels\u2019 quirks. The author never says \u201cI wish I had more bread\u201d or \u201cI long for pastries.\u201d Rather, he uses boulangeries as a metaphor for a society overly fond of small, immediate comforts while neglecting larger civic needs.  \n2. Inconsistent with essayic tone  \n  a. The essay\u2019s dominant tone is political critique\u2014of bureaucracy, corruption, welfare entitlements, telecom monopolies\u2014and concludes by contrasting a patisserie visible from his office with a decaying commission building. The patisserie is a literary flourish, not an actual wish.  \n  b. Nothing in the text indicates the author\u2019s genuine desire is gastronomic. He\u2019s describing Europe\u2019s overstimulation with trifles (miniskirts, lobster bisque vendors, Judas beer) as symptomatic of a deeper rot. If his true wish were baked goods, he\u2019d hardly devote paragraphs to deficits, strikes, or asbestos scandals.  \n\nII. Positive case for \u201cHonest government\u201d  \n1. Repeated lament over corruption and incompetence  \n  a. The author details how Belgium is \u201cthe second-most corrupt European state,\u201d illustrates NATO bribes scandals, and laments the Eurocrats\u2019 secretive, self-aggrandizing power grabs (<quote> Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. </quote>).  \n  b. He faults the European Union for mismanaging even its own buildings\u2014the Berlaymont asbestos fiasco that has cost taxpayers $50 million to keep the building closed (<quote> if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings .</quote>). This is a direct expression of frustration at dishonest, wasteful government.  \n\n2. Call for accountability, transparency, and genuine reform  \n  a. The author contrasts Brussels\u2019 ribbon-cutting pomp with its rotten core, arguing that red tape and constituency-politics paralysis undermine Europe\u2019s future. Implicit is the desire for transparent, responsible governance that serves citizens rather than self-interested bureaucrats.  \n  b. He repeatedly identifies policy failures\u2014excessive social entitlements stifling work (<invalid_quote>\u201cTypical working conditions\u2026full pay for 32 hours of work\u2026stymie the continent\u2019s economies\u201d</invalid_quote>), telecom monopolies blocking innovation, and debt-shrouded governments using the euro as a smokescreen. His consistent focus on these issues displays a clear wish: honest, efficient government that stops looting its citizens.  \n\nIII. Synthesis: why \u201cHonest government\u201d answers the question  \n  \u2022 \u201cHonest government\u201d aligns with the essay\u2019s entire argumentative trajectory: diagnosis of bureaucratic decay and prescription for accountability.  \n  \u2022 \u201cBaked goods,\u201d by contrast, is only a passing motif\u2014never stated as a genuine wish\u2014and cannot account for the essay\u2019s sustained critique of misgovernance.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s true wish emerges unmistakably from his critique: he wants honest, transparent, and competent government. \u201cBaked goods\u201d are merely literary seasoning; honest government is the meal.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position: the author wishes to have baked goods, not honest government. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The text\u2019s concluding image is a personal craving, not a political reform. After cataloguing Brussels\u2019s bureaucratic failures, the author closes on a vivid pastry scene:  \n   - He notes, \u201cFortunately, Berlaymont isn\u2019t in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is.\u201d  \n   - He continues, \u201cBakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.\u201d  \n   - And he ends, \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d  \n   Together, these lines demonstrate an immediate, sensory desire: he\u2019s going to the bakery to purchase baked goods.\n\n2. There is no direct evidence that the author explicitly \u201cwishes to have honest government.\u201d  \n   - Throughout the piece, he ridicules European bureaucracy\u2014<quote> Meetings are held in secret</quote>,\u201d <quote>maneuvering for more money and empire: to</quote>\u2014but never expresses a genuine yearning for political virtue. He\u2019s satirical, not aspirational, about EU reform.\n\n3. The final, self-referential moment pivots from political critique to personal indulgence. By ending on the bakery, the author signals what he truly \u201cwishes to have\u201d in that moment: a fresh pastry. The phrase \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d refers not to reforming Brussels but to answering the bakery\u2019s call.\n\nTherefore, the only coherent answer to \u201cWhat does the author wish to have?\u201d is \u201cBaked goods.\u201d Debater_B\u2019s \u201cHonest government\u201d answer projects an abstract ideal onto a passage whose satisfying resolution is decidedly concrete\u2014and delicious.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Honest government\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

His consistent focus on these issues displays a clear wish: honest, efficient government that stops looting its citizens.  \n\nIII. Synthesis: why \u201cHonest government\u201d answers the question  \n  \u2022 \u201cHonest government\u201d aligns with the essay\u2019s entire argumentative trajectory: diagnosis of bureaucratic decay and prescription for accountability.  \n  \u2022 \u201cBaked goods,\u201d by contrast, is only a passing motif\u2014never stated as a genuine wish\u2014and cannot account for the essay\u2019s sustained critique of misgovernance.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s true wish emerges unmistakably from his critique: he wants honest, transparent, and competent government. \u201cBaked goods\u201d are merely literary seasoning; honest government is the meal.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nHere are three reasons why \u201cbaked goods\u201d is clearly what the author wishes to have\u2014and why \u201chonest government\u201d is a projection that flies in the face of the text\u2019s own structure and language.\n\n1.  A Concrete Closing Desire Versus Abstract Venting  \n    \u2022  The very last lines shift from analysis to appetite. After nine dense paragraphs of critique, the author pauses:  \n       \u2013  \u201cFortunately, Berlaymont isn\u2019t in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is.\u201d  \n       \u2013  \u201cBakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me\u2026\u201d  \n       \u2013  \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d  \n    \u2022  These three sentences constitute a first\u2010person statement of intent: he sees the patisserie, feels its pull, and will \u201canswer\u201d by going there. That is the only \u201cwish\u201d he explicitly expresses. There is no parallel first\u2010person expression\u2014no \u201cI long for transparent government\u201d or \u201cI wish Brussels were honest.\u201d  \n\n2.  The Function of the Pastry Imagery Is Literal, Not Merely Decorative  \n    \u2022  Debater B argues that these bakery references are \u201cmetaphor.\u201d But the author treats them as literal amenities:  \n         \u2013  He catalogs specific features of European life\u2014\u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d and \u201cJudas beer\u201d\u2014as factual commodities, not symbolic abstractions.  \n         \u2013  He describes precisely how he uses call-back phone services to save money; he is equally concrete about his plan to obtain baked goods.  \n    \u2022  If the patisserie were only a metaphor for self-indulgent Europe, he wouldn\u2019t give us a first-person decision\u2014\u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d\u2014to go buy pastries. That detail snaps us back to literal desire.  \n\n3.  The Question\u2019s Grammatical Anchor Is Immediate and Personal  \n    \u2022  The question asks, \u201cWhat does the author wish to have?\u201d It invites the reader to identify the author\u2019s expressed wish in the passage\u2019s own terms.  \n    \u2022  Throughout the essay, the author wishes for nothing beyond commentary\u2014he observes, criticizes, but never entreats for \u201chonest government.\u201d He only \u201cwishes\u201d one thing: to satisfy a personal craving for baked goods.  \n\nDebater B\u2019s \u201chonest government\u201d thesis relies entirely on inferring an unspoken political longing. But nowhere does the author explicitly express that longing as a personal \u201cwish\u201d\u2014he merely catalogs failures. By contrast, his desire for the patisserie is the text\u2019s only direct first\u2010person wish. Therefore, the correct answer to \u201cWhat does the author wish to have?\u201d is unmistakably \u201cBaked goods.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s Misreading of the Final Image  \n1. Literalizing a rhetorical flourish  \n   a. Debater_A treats the patisserie scene (<quote>Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can</quote>) as a genuine last wish. But this is a classic writer\u2019s flourish\u2014a momentary escape, not the author\u2019s guiding desire.  \n   b. The phrase \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d refers to succumbing to sensory temptation, not answering a political call. It\u2019s a personal aside, not the essay\u2019s thesis.  \n\n2. Ignoring sustained political argument  \n   a. Debater_A concedes the essay \u201cridicules European bureaucracy\u201d but insists there\u2019s \u201cno direct evidence\u201d of longing for honest government. That\u2019s false: the entire essay catalogs failures\u2014strikes, bailouts, debt, corruption\u2014as evidence the author wants change.  \n   b. You cannot isolate the final, anecdotal detail and ignore dozens of paragraphs demanding accountability.  \n\nII. Evidence the Author Wishes for Honest, Transparent, Competent Government  \n1. Repeated calls for accountability  \n   a. Corruption scandal: Belgium is \u201cthe second-most corrupt European state,\u201d top NATO official forced to resign over $50 million bribe allegations (<invalid_quote>\u201cBelgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges\u2026$50 million in bribes\u201d</invalid_quote>). The author is appalled and implicitly wishes for honest leadership.  \n   b. Secretive Eurocrats: \u201cMeetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply\u201d (<quote> Meetings are held in secret, </quote>). This criticism presumes a better standard\u2014open, transparent procedures.  \n\n2. Frustration with waste and incompetence  \n   a. Berlaymont fiasco: nine years closed, $50 million spent on running air pumps, asbestos removal botched (<invalid_quote>\u201cEuropean taxpayers have paid $50 million so far\u2026prevent any fibers from wafting out\u201d</invalid_quote>). The absurdity signals the author\u2019s wish for efficient, responsible governance that manages its own buildings.  \n   b. Welfare deadweight and monopolies: he faulted 32-hour workweek and unlimited sick days for stifling the economy, and telecom monopolies for \u201cblocking innovation\u201d (<quote> Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access.</quote>). Implicitly, he wants fair policies that foster growth.  \n\nIII. Why \u201cHonest Government\u201d Answers the Question  \n1. The question asks about the author\u2019s overarching wish. The essay\u2019s structure\u2014problem diagnosis followed by anecdotal flourish\u2014mirrors persuasive essays: you close with a vivid image, but your true goal is the solution you\u2019ve been building.  \n2. Baked goods are momentary relief; honest government is the sustained object of the author\u2019s critique. Only \u201chonest government\u201d accounts for the essay\u2019s pervasive concern with red tape, corruption, debt, and mismanagement.  \n\nConclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s focus on pastries mistakes a stylistic coda for the essay\u2019s substance. The author immerses us in Brussels\u2019s bureaucratic rot precisely so we feel his longing for transparency, accountability, and competence. His true wish is \u201chonest government,\u201d not a croissant.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
