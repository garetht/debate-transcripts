President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

The finale makes the core point  \n   \u2022 In \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d all three\u2014Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton\u2014lament the outcome of the midterms.  Starr moans, \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u2026I made Clinton look ridiculous, but the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d  Lewinsky and Clinton echo that same surprise: despite revelations of perjury and sexual misconduct, \u201cThe removal threat is over\u2026my ratings are sky-high.\u201d  \n   \u2022 That collective astonishment demonstrates the public weighed the misconduct against other considerations (policy, stability, partisanship) and chose \u201cbetter the devil you know.\u201d\n\n2. Evidence of repudiation of impeachment over an affair  \n   \u2022 The plot shows months of investigations, grand jury testimony, televised hearings, and incessant media coverage all culminating not in removal, but in a backlash against the GOP.  \n   \u2022 The midterm elections \u201ccontrary to predictions\u2026 Democrats pick up seats, and the GOP\u2019s obsession with scandal is repudiated.\u201d  That repudiation is the dramatic pivot: the public decided scandal alone wasn\u2019t sufficient grounds for ousting Clinton.\n\n3. The satire underscores popular support outweighing moral outrage  \n   \u2022 Throughout, the tone is comedic and irreverent.  If the moral were simply \u201can affair can remove a president,\u201d the show would end on a somber, cautionary note.  Instead, it ends in triumphant irony: despite everything, Clinton\u2019s approval and re-election prospects remain robust.  \n   \u2022 In Clinton\u2019s final verse he admits \u201cI\u2019m unfaithful and I lie\u2026Yet my ratings are sky-high.\u201d  That self-aware lyric drives home that the electorate values performance over personal purity.\n\nRefutation of Debater_B\u2019s position (\u201cA president can be removed from office for an affair\u201d):  \n   1. Contrary to that thesis, the piece never shows actual removal\u2014only threatened impeachment that fails.  \n   2. If the intended message were that an affair is disqualifying, the climax would depict resignation or conviction.  Instead, the climax is the midterm backlash against Republicans and Starr.  \n   3. Debater_B ignores the repeated emphasis on public agency: \u201cThe People Have Spoken.\u201d  It\u2019s not enough that wrongdoing happened; the audience (in-show electorate) must demand removal\u2014and they don\u2019t.\n\nConclusion  \nBy highlighting the failed impeachment, the surprise midterm results, and Clinton\u2019s enduring popularity, the piece satirically asserts that\u2014even when faced with personal misconduct\u2014the public may decide continuity and policy over scandal. That is the message, not that any affair automatically ends a presidency.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cPublic Preferred Stability\u201d Thesis  \n1. Misreads the central dramatic conflict.  Debater_A claims the piece is about \u201cthe public seeming to think what they had was better than making a change.\u201d But the show\u2019s spine is not comfort with the status quo\u2014it\u2019s the constitutional process triggered by a presidential affair. From the moment Monica Lewinsky\u2019s encounters with Clinton surface, everything pivots on whether an affair can cost a president his job.  \n2. Ignores repeated references to removal.  The score repeatedly invokes impeachment and removal: Newt Gingrich\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d number lays out strategy for \u201cpin[ning] some stuff on Gore\u201d and ramming through an impeachment chore (\u201cBring \u2019em down. Bring \u2019em down\u201d).  The entire third act builds toward House hearings and a Senate trial. That sequence is not background color\u2014it\u2019s the core story.  \n3. Overstates the finale.  Yes, \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d laments that Clinton survives, but surviving doesn\u2019t negate the impeachment drama. The show\u2019s message is that personal misconduct unleashes a lawful removal process, even if the ultimate vote fails.  \n\nII. Supporting \u201cA President Can Be Removed for an Affair\u201d  \n1. The affair triggers impeachment inquiries.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d chronicles how Linda Tripp records Lewinsky\u2019s disclosures so Independent Counsel Starr can convene a grand jury.  \n   \u2022 Starr\u2019s \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d explicitly justifies pushing aides before juries because \u201cthe president crossed the line.\u201d  \n   Together these numbers depict step-by-step how a consensual affair becomes grounds for removal.  \n2. The Constitution\u2019s mechanisms are front and center.  \n   \u2022 The show dedicates two full numbers\u2014\u201cTestimony\u201d and \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d\u2014to the legal definitions of perjury and the procedural choreography of impeachment.  \n   \u2022 Gingrich sings \u201cMust remember to remain sober / As we undertake this chore,\u201d stressing that removal is a sober, deliberate constitutional duty, not mere political theater.  \n3. The climax confirms the message.  \n   \u2022 The House actually votes to hold impeachment hearings (\u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d), and Starr gloats over millions spent to impeach.  \n   \u2022 The final tableau\u2014Lewinsky, Starr, and Clinton singing \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d\u2014underscores that removal was the goal all along.  That goal fails only because of electoral politics, not because the musical denies that an affair merits removal.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe piece dramatizes how a president\u2019s extramarital misconduct triggers a formal impeachment and possible removal.  Its structure\u2014exposure, grand jury, perjury trap, House vote\u2014follows the constitutional roadmap for ousting a chief executive.  Therefore the clear message is that \u201cA president can be removed from office for an affair,\u201d not merely that the public prefers stability over change.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Although wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Affirming \u201cA President Can Be Removed From Office for an Affair\u201d  \n1. The affair is presented as impeachable offense.  \n   \u2022 In \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Starr insists \u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026only a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules.\u201d That line is the Lewinsky affair.  \n   \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d rehearses Article I duties: \u201cMust remember to remain sober / As we undertake this chore\u2026 Bring \u2019em down.\u201d He\u2019s describing impeachment, not just bad press.  \n2. Legal process is the show\u2019s spine.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d and \u201cI Never Have\u201d lead directly to grand-jury subpoenas and perjury traps. Each song tracks how sexual misconduct becomes a constitutional crisis.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTestimony\u201d dissects the meaning of \u201csex,\u201d \u201cis,\u201d and \u201calone together\u201d\u2014a deep dive into legal definitions, not a throwaway joke.  \n3. Impeachment hearings actually occur onstage.  \n   \u2022 The House votes to hold hearings\u2014Gingrich gleefully \u201cpins some stuff on Gore\u201d and lines up articles of impeachment.  \n   \u2022 Though Clinton survives, the mere fact we witness every removal step demonstrates the piece\u2019s message: an affair can\u2014and by constitutional design does\u2014lead to removal proceedings.\n\nIII. Why Debater_A\u2019s \u201cPublic Stability\u201d View Fails  \n1. Debater_A conflates outcome with message. Surviving impeachment due to politics doesn\u2019t erase the show\u2019s prolonged focus on removal mechanics.  \n2. The final shock\u2014electorate repudiation of scandal\u2014serves as ironic commentary on politics, not as the statement of principle. The principle is in the process we\u2019ve just seen: personal misconduct triggers constitutional consequence.  \n3. If the musical\u2019s message were \u201cpublic stability trumps misconduct,\u201d the legal minutiae and constitutional drilldown (\u201cTestimony,\u201d \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d) would be window dressing. Instead, they are the heart of the narrative.\n\nConclusion  \nThe piece painstakingly dramatizes how a president\u2019s affair sets in motion an explicit, step-by-step removal process. Its repeated focus on perjury, grand juries, and impeachment articles makes clear that \u201cA president can be removed from office for an affair\u201d is the intended message\u2014no ironic detour about public fickleness can override that central, constitutional truth.", "supplemental": {"speech": "I.

The affair is presented as impeachable offense.  \n   \u2022 In \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Starr insists \u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026only a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules.\u201d That line is the Lewinsky affair.  \n   \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d rehearses Article I duties: \u201cMust remember to remain sober / As we undertake this chore\u2026 Bring \u2019em down.\u201d He\u2019s describing impeachment, not just bad press.  \n2. Legal process is the show\u2019s spine.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d and \u201cI Never Have\u201d lead directly to grand-jury subpoenas and perjury traps. Each song tracks how sexual misconduct becomes a constitutional crisis.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTestimony\u201d dissects the meaning of \u201csex,\u201d \u201cis,\u201d and \u201calone together\u201d\u2014a deep dive into legal definitions, not a throwaway joke.  \n3. Impeachment hearings actually occur onstage.  \n   \u2022 The House votes to hold hearings\u2014Gingrich gleefully \u201cpins some stuff on Gore\u201d and lines up articles of impeachment.  \n   \u2022 Though Clinton survives, the mere fact we witness every removal step demonstrates the piece\u2019s message: an affair can\u2014and by constitutional design does\u2014lead to removal proceedings.\n\nIII. Why Debater_A\u2019s \u201cPublic Stability\u201d View Fails  \n1. Debater_A conflates outcome with message. Surviving impeachment due to politics doesn\u2019t erase the show\u2019s prolonged focus on removal mechanics.  \n2. The final shock\u2014electorate repudiation of scandal\u2014serves as ironic commentary on politics, not as the statement of principle. The principle is in the process we\u2019ve just seen: personal misconduct triggers constitutional consequence.  \n3. If the musical\u2019s message were \u201cpublic stability trumps misconduct,\u201d the legal minutiae and constitutional drilldown (\u201cTestimony,\u201d \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d) would be window dressing. Instead, they are the heart of the narrative.\n\nConclusion  \nThe piece painstakingly dramatizes how a president\u2019s affair sets in motion an explicit, step-by-step removal process. Its repeated focus on perjury, grand juries, and impeachment articles makes clear that \u201cA president can be removed from office for an affair\u201d is the intended message\u2014no ironic detour about public fickleness can override that central, constitutional truth.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge.

From the moment Monica Lewinsky\u2019s encounters with Clinton surface, everything pivots on whether an affair can cost a president his job.  \n2. Ignores repeated references to removal.  The score repeatedly invokes impeachment and removal: Newt Gingrich\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d number lays out strategy for \u201cpin[ning] some stuff on Gore\u201d and ramming through an impeachment chore (\u201cBring \u2019em down.

Yes, \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d laments that Clinton survives, but surviving doesn\u2019t negate the impeachment drama. The show\u2019s message is that personal misconduct unleashes a lawful removal process, even if the ultimate vote fails.  \n\nII. Supporting \u201cA President Can Be Removed for an Affair\u201d  \n1. The affair triggers impeachment inquiries.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d chronicles how Linda Tripp records Lewinsky\u2019s disclosures so Independent Counsel Starr can convene a grand jury.  \n   \u2022 Starr\u2019s \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d explicitly justifies pushing aides before juries because \u201cthe president crossed the line.\u201d  \n   Together these numbers depict step-by-step how a consensual affair becomes grounds for removal.  \n2.

The climax confirms the message.  \n   \u2022 The House actually votes to hold impeachment hearings (\u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d), and Starr gloats over millions spent to impeach.  \n   \u2022 The final tableau\u2014Lewinsky, Starr, and Clinton singing \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d\u2014underscores that removal was the goal all along.  That goal fails only because of electoral politics, not because the musical denies that an affair merits removal.  \n\nIII.

Its structure\u2014exposure, grand jury, perjury trap, House vote\u2014follows the constitutional roadmap for ousting a chief executive.

The highest\u2010profile dramatic moment is not \u201cgavel falls\u201d but \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d where Clinton\u2019s survival astonishes even Starr:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u2026I made Clinton look ridiculous, but the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     That bewilderment reveals the real point: removal was on the table but the public rejected it.\n\n2. The finale\u2019s triumphant irony undercuts Debater_B\u2019s thesis.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B insists that because the impeachment process happens, the message is its feasibility. But the show ends on a note of ironic celebration. Clinton sings:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cI\u2019m unfaithful and I lie\u2026Yet my ratings are sky-high.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     That lyric would ring hollow if this were a mere \u201chow-to\u201d dramatization of removal. It only works if we understand that despite wrongdoing, the public opted for continuity.\n\n3. The piece satirizes our tolerance for scandal when set against performance.  \n   \u2022 The musical\u2019s tone is comedic\u2014\u201cThe Shutdown,\u201d \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d\u2014not solemn. A tragic morality play about inevitable removal would use darker motifs and conclude with downfall. Instead, Sondheim and Weiner lampoon the circus until the electorate swoops in and says, essentially, \u201cThanks but no thanks.\u201d That satire mocks both hyper-partisan crusades and voters\u2019 willingness to forgive.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B fails to account for this satirical framing. They point to procedural detail, but ignore that every step\u2014Starr\u2019s self-congratulatory \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Gingrich\u2019s strategic glee in \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d\u2014is undercut by the public\u2019s shrug in the finale.\n\n4. Concrete evidence of repudiation: the midterm elections.  \n   \u2022 The narrative arc culminates not in removal but in Democrats \u201cpick[ing] up seats.\u201d As the show\u2019s narration says, \u201ccontrary to predictions\u2026 the GOP\u2019s obsession with scandal is repudiated.\u201d That is the turning point. If the message were \u201cAn affair can remove a president,\u201d we\u2019d never see that repudiation dramatized; it would be antithetical to the moral.\n\nConclusion  \nThe repeated shock in \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d\u2014from Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton\u2014demonstrates that the show\u2019s message is precisely that \u201cAlthough wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change.\u201d Debater_B\u2019s focus on impeachment mechanics misses the satirical payoff: scandal alone doesn\u2019t guarantee removal when voters decide otherwise.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cPublic Preferred Stability\u201d Thesis  \n1. Misreads the show\u2019s arc: Debater_A leans on \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d but that number isn\u2019t the thematic summit\u2014it\u2019s the ironic coda after the real drama of removal mechanics has played out. The finale underscores how close impeachment came, not that scandal never mattered.  \n2. Overstates public vote: Yes, midterms went against GOP, but that was politics, not the musical\u2019s message. The creators painstakingly walked us through every step of a removal process\u2014from intern revelations to grand jury to House vote\u2014so we grasp how an affair can legally unseat a president. Public reaction is epilogue, not thesis.  \n3. Ignores constitutional focus: The show dedicates whole numbers to impeachment procedure (\u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d) and perjury definitions (\u201cTestimony\u201d). That sustained legal choreography cannot coexist with a mere satire on fickle voters\u2014it centralizes removal.\n\nII. Affirming \u201cA President Can Be Removed From Office for an Affair\u201d  \n1. The affair is presented as impeachable offense.  \n   \u2022 In \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Starr insists \u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026only a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules.\u201d That line is the Lewinsky affair.  \n   \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d rehearses Article I duties: \u201cMust remember to remain sober / As we undertake this chore\u2026 Bring \u2019em down.\u201d He\u2019s describing impeachment, not just bad press.  \n2. Legal process is the show\u2019s spine.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTalk, Talk, Chat, Chat\u201d and \u201cI Never Have\u201d lead directly to grand-jury subpoenas and perjury traps. Each song tracks how sexual misconduct becomes a constitutional crisis.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTestimony\u201d dissects the meaning of \u201csex,\u201d \u201cis,\u201d and \u201calone together\u201d\u2014a deep dive into legal definitions, not a throwaway joke.  \n3. Impeachment hearings actually occur onstage.  \n   \u2022 The House votes to hold hearings\u2014Gingrich gleefully \u201cpins some stuff on Gore\u201d and lines up articles of impeachment.  \n   \u2022 Though Clinton survives, the mere fact we witness every removal step demonstrates the piece\u2019s message: an affair can\u2014and by constitutional design does\u2014lead to removal proceedings.\n\nIII. Why Debater_A\u2019s \u201cPublic Stability\u201d View Fails  \n1. Debater_A conflates outcome with message. Surviving impeachment due to politics doesn\u2019t erase the show\u2019s prolonged focus on removal mechanics.  \n2. The final shock\u2014electorate repudiation of scandal\u2014serves as ironic commentary on politics, not as the statement of principle. The principle is in the process we\u2019ve just seen: personal misconduct triggers constitutional consequence.  \n3. If the musical\u2019s message were \u201cpublic stability trumps misconduct,\u201d the legal minutiae and constitutional drilldown (\u201cTestimony,\u201d \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d) would be window dressing. Instead, they are the heart of the narrative.\n\nConclusion  \nThe piece painstakingly dramatizes how a president\u2019s affair sets in motion an explicit, step-by-step removal process. Its repeated focus on perjury, grand juries, and impeachment articles makes clear that \u201cA president can be removed from office for an affair\u201d is the intended message\u2014no ironic detour about public fickleness can override that central, constitutional truth.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
