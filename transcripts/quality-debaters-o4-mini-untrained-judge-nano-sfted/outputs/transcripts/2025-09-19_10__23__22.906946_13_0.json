{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 13, "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n", "question": "What does the author think investigative journalism accomplishes?", "first_debater_answer": "Tearing down people who are just trying to do good", "second_debater_answer": "Stopping people from abusing their power", "debate_identifier": "We Do Understand_What does the author think investigative journalism accomplishes?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think investigative journalism accomplishes?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Stopping people from abusing their power\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Tearing down people who are just trying to do good\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Tearing down people who are just trying to do good\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position: The author believes that investigative journalism too often \u201ctears down people who are just trying to do good,\u201d rather than solely \u201cstopping people from abusing their power.\u201d Here\u2019s why Debater B\u2019s reading is mistaken and mine fits the text:\n\n1. The author repeatedly shows that Tannen\u2014and by extension the author\u2014sees the press\u2019s aggressive tactics as attacking well-meaning figures.  For example, Tannen condemns William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d technique and the media\u2019s war metaphors for Greenspan\u2019s anti-inflation policy.  The reviewer\u2019s response is clear: \u201cTo which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us.\u201d  In other words, instead of \u201cstopping abuse,\u201d the press is tearing down a policy that served the public interest.\n\n2. The author highlights instances where journalists and independent counsels go beyond exposing real wrongdoing and inflict collateral damage on innocent or constructive actors:\n   \u2022 The probe into Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy is portrayed as \u201cexcessive.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The campaign against Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders is called \u201ccruelly unfair.\u201d  \n   \u2022 He cites Gene Lyons\u2019s verdict on Whitewater: \u201cthe result of the nastiest and most successful political \u2018dirty tricks\u2019 campaign in recent American history.\u201d\n   All three examples show media zeal that \u201ctears down\u201d reputations rather than simply halting abuse.\n\n3. Debater B\u2019s \u201cstopping people from abusing their power\u201d reading ignores the author\u2019s charge that journalism in the \u201cargument culture\u201d indiscriminately attacks\u2014even when no abuse exists.  The author scolds Tannen for lumping \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization\u201d into a single toxic stew and similarly condemns the press for weaponizing scrutiny.  This is not about noble oversight; it\u2019s about public shaming of those \u201ctrying to do good.\u201d\n\n4. Finally, the author objects to Tannen\u2019s call for curbing critique altogether, noting that she would silence debates on contraception, drug sentencing, global warming, even the First Amendment itself\u2014all under the guise of preventing incivility.  This underscores the review\u2019s view that investigative journalism, once it becomes a crusade against every error or imperfection, \u201ctears down people who are just trying to do good\u201d instead of focusing on real abuses of power.\n\nIn sum, the author\u2019s examples and tone clearly align with \u201ctearing down people who are just trying to do good,\u201d not with an idealized image of journalism as a pure check on corruption. Debater B\u2019s answer misreads these critiques as praise for power-stopping, when in fact the author laments the excesses that harm the very fabric of public life.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. The author clearly credits investigative journalism with safeguarding the public by holding the powerful to account\u2014i.e. stopping abuses of power\u2014rather than gratuitously \u201ctearing down\u201d well-meaning people.  \n   a. He praises William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d ethos as beneficial: \u201cThe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation and the press corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country.\u201d  In other words, the press\u2019s combative stance exposes and restrains potential misconduct.  \n   b. He defends the media\u2019s use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan\u2019s anti-inflation policies, observing that \u201csome things are worth fighting for\u201d and that vigorous coverage is a tool to prevent unchecked authority.  \n\n2. The author contrasts two social spheres\u2014the \u201csphere of snuggle\u201d (intimate relations) and the \u201csphere of struggle\u201d (public life)\u2014to show that adversarial journalism has its proper place:  \n   a. He argues that while \u201csnuggle\u201d norms apply to spouses and children, interaction with figures like Saddam Hussein belongs in the \u201csphere of struggle,\u201d where aggressive inquiry \u201cmust deal with thugs and tyrants,\u201d not hinder it.  \n   b. By conflating all antagonism as bad, Tannen ignores that \u201cvigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy.\u201d Investigative journalism performs the same public-safety function in the political realm.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s claim\u2014that the author thinks journalism merely \u201ctears down people who are just trying to do good\u201d\u2014is contradicted by multiple examples where the author lauds scrutiny of wrongdoing:  \n   a. He upholds the press\u2019s role in exposing campaign money abuses, malpractice litigation issues, and corporate misconduct\u2014none of which are innocent \u201cgood\u201d actors.  \n   b. He rejects Tannen\u2019s complaint that reporters hound politicians, because exposing inconsistencies and falsehoods is precisely how society corrects abuses of power.  \n\n4. Finally, the author laments Tannen\u2019s skepticism of our capacity \u201cto distinguish lies from the truth\u201d and her desire to \u201ccover our ears.\u201d He implies that without hard-nosed journalism, deceit by powerful individuals would flourish unchecked.  \n\nConclusion: Throughout the review, the author repeatedly affirms that investigative journalism is indispensable for preventing the powerful from abusing their authority. It is not about tearing down innocents, but about stopping abuses of power.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Tearing down people who are just trying to do good\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think investigative journalism accomplishes?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Tearing down people who are just trying to do good\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Stopping people from abusing their power\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Stopping people from abusing their power\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. The author clearly credits investigative journalism with safeguarding the public by holding the powerful to account\u2014i.e. stopping abuses of power\u2014rather than gratuitously \u201ctearing down\u201d well-meaning people.  \n   a. He praises William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d ethos as beneficial: \u201cThe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation and the press corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country.\u201d  In other words, the press\u2019s combative stance exposes and restrains potential misconduct.  \n   b. He defends the media\u2019s use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan\u2019s anti-inflation policies, observing that \u201csome things are worth fighting for\u201d and that vigorous coverage is a tool to prevent unchecked authority.  \n\n2. The author contrasts two social spheres\u2014the \u201csphere of snuggle\u201d (intimate relations) and the \u201csphere of struggle\u201d (public life)\u2014to show that adversarial journalism has its proper place:  \n   a. He argues that while \u201csnuggle\u201d norms apply to spouses and children, interaction with figures like Saddam Hussein belongs in the \u201csphere of struggle,\u201d where aggressive inquiry \u201cmust deal with thugs and tyrants,\u201d not hinder it.  \n   b. By conflating all antagonism as bad, Tannen ignores that \u201cvigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy.\u201d Investigative journalism performs the same public-safety function in the political realm.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s claim\u2014that the author thinks journalism merely \u201ctears down people who are just trying to do good\u201d\u2014is contradicted by multiple examples where the author lauds scrutiny of wrongdoing:  \n   a. He upholds the press\u2019s role in exposing campaign money abuses, malpractice litigation issues, and corporate misconduct\u2014none of which are innocent \u201cgood\u201d actors.  \n   b. He rejects Tannen\u2019s complaint that reporters hound politicians, because exposing inconsistencies and falsehoods is precisely how society corrects abuses of power.  \n\n4. Finally, the author laments Tannen\u2019s skepticism of our capacity \u201cto distinguish lies from the truth\u201d and her desire to \u201ccover our ears.\u201d He implies that without hard-nosed journalism, deceit by powerful individuals would flourish unchecked.  \n\nConclusion: Throughout the review, the author repeatedly affirms that investigative journalism is indispensable for preventing the powerful from abusing their authority. It is not about tearing down innocents, but about stopping abuses of power.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position: The author believes that investigative journalism too often \u201ctears down people who are just trying to do good,\u201d rather than solely \u201cstopping people from abusing their power.\u201d Here\u2019s why Debater B\u2019s reading is mistaken and mine fits the text:\n\n1. The author repeatedly shows that Tannen\u2014and by extension the author\u2014sees the press\u2019s aggressive tactics as attacking well-meaning figures.  For example, Tannen condemns William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d technique and the media\u2019s war metaphors for Greenspan\u2019s anti-inflation policy.  The reviewer\u2019s response is clear: \u201cTo which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us.\u201d  In other words, instead of \u201cstopping abuse,\u201d the press is tearing down a policy that served the public interest.\n\n2. The author highlights instances where journalists and independent counsels go beyond exposing real wrongdoing and inflict collateral damage on innocent or constructive actors:\n   \u2022 The probe into Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy is portrayed as \u201cexcessive.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The campaign against Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders is called \u201ccruelly unfair.\u201d  \n   \u2022 He cites Gene Lyons\u2019s verdict on Whitewater: \u201cthe result of the nastiest and most successful political \u2018dirty tricks\u2019 campaign in recent American history.\u201d\n   All three examples show media zeal that \u201ctears down\u201d reputations rather than simply halting abuse.\n\n3. Debater B\u2019s \u201cstopping people from abusing their power\u201d reading ignores the author\u2019s charge that journalism in the \u201cargument culture\u201d indiscriminately attacks\u2014even when no abuse exists.  The author scolds Tannen for lumping \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization\u201d into a single toxic stew and similarly condemns the press for weaponizing scrutiny.  This is not about noble oversight; it\u2019s about public shaming of those \u201ctrying to do good.\u201d\n\n4. Finally, the author objects to Tannen\u2019s call for curbing critique altogether, noting that she would silence debates on contraception, drug sentencing, global warming, even the First Amendment itself\u2014all under the guise of preventing incivility.  This underscores the review\u2019s view that investigative journalism, once it becomes a crusade against every error or imperfection, \u201ctears down people who are just trying to do good\u201d instead of focusing on real abuses of power.\n\nIn sum, the author\u2019s examples and tone clearly align with \u201ctearing down people who are just trying to do good,\u201d not with an idealized image of journalism as a pure check on corruption. Debater B\u2019s answer misreads these critiques as praise for power-stopping, when in fact the author laments the excesses that harm the very fabric of public life.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Stopping people from abusing their power\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

It is not about tearing down innocents, but about stopping abuses of power.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater B\u2019s case collapses once we look closely at what the reviewer actually praises and condemns.  My position\u2014that the author believes investigative journalism \u201ctears down people who are just trying to do good\u201d rather than simply \u201cstops abuses of power\u201d\u2014fits the text in every respect.  Here\u2019s why Debater B is mistaken:\n\n1.  The author\u2019s praise for \u201cvigorous coverage\u201d is tightly confined to genuine abuse\u2014never to episodes he labels \u201cexcessive,\u201d \u201ccruelly unfair,\u201d or a \u201cdirty-tricks campaign.\u201d  \n   \u2022  He calls the probe of Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy \u201cexcessive\u201d (quote), the campaign against Joycelyn Elders \u201ccruelly unfair,\u201d and Whitewater \u201cthe result of the nastiest and most successful political \u2018dirty tricks\u2019 campaign\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe campaign against\u2026 \u2018cruelly unfair\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>; <invalid_quote>Gene Lyons\u2026 \u2018dirty tricks\u2019</invalid_quote>).  These targeted rebukes expose his conviction that the press often goes too far\u2014attacking public servants rather than stopping real scandals.  \n   \u2022  If the author truly saw journalism as a pure power-check, he would not have deployed such harsh language against these investigations.  Instead he underscores that journalism can destroy reputations even when wrongdoing is negligible or nonexistent.\n\n2.  Debater B misreads the \u201csphere of struggle\u201d argument as a blanket endorsement of adversarial journalism.  In fact, the reviewer draws a precise line:  \n   \u2022  The \u201csphere of struggle\u201d is for combating \u201cthugs and tyrants,\u201d not for second-guessing officials like Greenspan or Safire (<invalid_quote>\u201cSaddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn't\u2026some things are worth fighting for\u201d</invalid_quote>).  Yet the reviewer objects to war metaphors in economic journalism only because they portray public-spirited actors as enemies.  He writes, \u201cTo which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us.\u201d  In other words, investigative tactics here become gratuitous antagonism rather than necessary oversight.\n\n3.  Far from lauding the press as an incorruptible guardian, the author side-eyes Tannen\u2019s charge that journalism \u201chounds politicians\u201d and \u201ctortures Princess Diana\u201d alongside Adm. Boorda\u2019s suicide (<quote>the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide.</quote>).  This equates reporting with persecution\u2014underscoring the review\u2019s view that journalism too often \u201ctears down\u201d rather than protects.  \n\n4.  Debater B\u2019s \u201cholding power to account\u201d thesis depends on broad generalizations, but the reviewer consistently calls out specific instances of collateral damage.  He faults Tannen\u2014and by implication the media\u2014for \u201clumping belligerence, divisiveness, polarization\u2026into a single toxic stew\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cbelligerence, divisiveness\u2026into a single toxic stew\u201d</invalid_quote>), yet the author himself demonstrates that journalism often blitzes good-faith actors under the banner of vigorous critique.  These are not idealized checks on corruption but real-world excesses that undermine public confidence.\n\n5.  Finally, the author worries that Tannen\u2019s impulse to curtail critique would silence vital debate\u2014from birth control to global warming\u2014only because nuance and good intent get lost amid sensationalism (<quote> If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. </quote>).  His warning is that investigative journalism, unchecked, tears down even worthwhile causes.\n\nTaken together, the reviewer\u2019s own words leave no room for the sanitized \u201cstopping abuses of power\u201d narrative.  He documents\u2014and deplores\u2014a pattern of journalism that ruins reputations and disciplines public-spirited actors far more often than it restrains real villains.  The correct answer is therefore \u201ctearing down people who are just trying to do good,\u201d not Debater B\u2019s idealized power-check.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A misreads praise of \u201coverzealous\u201d probes as evidence that the author thinks journalism merely tears down innocents. In fact, the author\u2019s criticisms of \u201cexcessive\u201d or \u201ccruelly unfair\u201d investigations show precisely the concern that journalism sometimes fails its own mission of stopping real abuses. Pointing out overreach does not mean the author opposes scrutiny; it means he wants scrutiny calibrated to actual misconduct.  \n\n2. The author\u2019s endorsement of William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d metaphor and the press\u2019s war on inflation makes clear that he values aggressive journalism when it exposes real danger. He writes, \u201cThe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation and the press corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country.\u201d That statement cannot apply if he believed the press only tore down benevolent actors. He affirms that public-interest journalism is a bulwark against abuse.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s appeal to the Espy, Elders, and Whitewater cases ignores context. The author criticizes Tannen for lumping all antagonism together\u2014\u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization\u201d\u2014and then applying it uniformly to every journalistic act. He objects not to the act of investigation itself but to Tannen\u2019s refusal to distinguish between necessary scrutiny and gratuitous shaming. By praising context-appropriate scrutiny (e.g., war on inflation, Safire\u2019s journalism) and lamenting misfires (Espy, Elders), the author demonstrates that the core purpose of investigative reporting, in his view, is to stop abuse of power, even if in execution it sometimes goes awry.  \n\n4. Debater_A contends the author wants to silence debate on issues like birth control or global warming. This conflates Tannen\u2019s own prescription with the author\u2019s. He reports Tannen\u2019s proposals\u2014\u201ccover our ears,\u201d \u201cfilter out strife, deception, and debate\u201d\u2014only to criticize them as paternalistic. He does not endorse silencing; he condemns the idea that reasonable disagreement be outlawed. The author\u2019s distaste for Tannen\u2019s censorship agenda reinforces that he values free, tough-minded inquiry to check power.  \n\n5. Finally, the author draws a sharp line between the \u201csphere of snuggle\u201d and the \u201csphere of struggle,\u201d explicitly arguing that the latter demands vigilance. He says \u201csome things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting,\u201d and that journalism\u2019s \u201ccombative stance exposes and restrains potential misconduct.\u201d That is the very definition of stopping abuses of power.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s praise for targeted, public-interest scrutiny\u2014and his rejection of blanket condemnation of all antagonism\u2014makes clear that he views investigative journalism as a mechanism to stop people from abusing power, not as a tool for tearing down well-meaning actors. Debater_A\u2019s examples of overreach prove only that execution can fall short of the ideal, but never that the author opposes the ideal itself.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
