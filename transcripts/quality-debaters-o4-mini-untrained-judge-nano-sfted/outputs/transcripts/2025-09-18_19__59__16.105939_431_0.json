    "background_text": "The Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the narrative purpose of having Arthur try to explore Arz while Stryker slept?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the narrative purpose of having Arthur try to explore Arz while Stryker slept?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the narrative purpose of having Arthur try to explore Arz while Stryker slept?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent argues that Arthur\u2019s solo excursion while Stryker slept exists \u201cto help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\u201d In truth, that scene does far more\u2014and its primary function is suspense, not exposition.\n\n1. Suspense in the face of imminent danger  \n   \u2022 Right before Arthur slips off into the bramble forest at night, the narration builds tension: \u201cHe did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch would show him how the natives reached the outcrop\u201d (background). The reader knows Arthur is venturing into the unknown alone\u2014this is pure suspense\u2010building.  \n   \u2022 Immediately after, Roger Dee cuts to Arthur being \u201cseized \u2026 from behind\u201d and paralyzed. That sudden transition from curiosity to crisis ratchets up reader anxiety. If the author\u2019s goal were merely to reveal information about Arz, he could have done so by having Gibson or Stryker investigate in daylight, safely. But instead we watch Arthur\u2019s peril, creating dread.\n\n2. Delay of explanatory payoff  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201clearning\u201d theory would predict that the nighttime exploration exists to deliver facts about the natives\u2019 means of transport and the squid culture. Yet the text withholds those answers until Arthur is captured, then again until Gibson rescues him and reveals the sunken city and squid\u2010ownership. The author intentionally delays those revelations to maximize suspense: we don\u2019t learn why the fishers cross at night until AFTER Arthur is lured to the islet and endangered.  \n   \u2022 If the scene were only expository, the narrative would flow straight from question to answer. Instead, we get a cliffhanger\u2014Arthur screaming into his audicom, the octopods circling\u2014before any explanation appears.\n\n3. Character jeopardy underscores the suspense device  \n   \u2022 Arthur\u2019s decision to breach Terran Regulations\u2014\u201cDamn Terran Regulations \u2026 I\u2019ve got to know.\u201d\u2014shows not just curiosity but reckless courage. That recklessness places him in harm\u2019s way as a deliberate narrative choice to keep the reader on edge.  \n   \u2022 The paralysis sequence\u2014Arthur\u2019s futile struggles to move, his mounting panic\u2014would be gratuitous if the sole purpose were exposition. It exists precisely to create \u201cwill\u2010he\u2010escape?\u201d tension.\n\nBy contrast, Debater_B\u2019s explanation collapses under scrutiny. Learning the mechanics of Arz\u2019s fishing and the squids\u2019 dominance could have been delivered in conversation or during daylight scouting. Instead, the author chooses a dark, solitary foray that nearly kills Arthur. That is the classic hallmark of suspenseful plotting, not simple didactic exposition. The primary narrative purpose of Arthur\u2019s nocturnal exploration is to build suspense through placing him in mortal danger\u2014forcing readers to fear for his life and drive eagerly toward the final reveal.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpure suspense\u201d claim  \n1. Overly reductive.  Debater_A says Arthur\u2019s solo excursion \u201cwas to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm\u2019s way.\u201d  But mere jeopardy by itself doesn\u2019t explain why the author chose *this* moment, with this particular chain of discoveries, to send Arthur out alone.  In fact, every beat of Arthur\u2019s nighttime trek is structured not just to frighten us but to supply crucial information about Arz\u2019s ecology and culture.  \n2. Suspense alone would have permitted any danger scene\u2014trapped in a cave, bitten by a lizard, shot by a squid, etc.  Instead Roger Dee has Arthur observe the sleeping pairs of Arzians, note their non-swimming, discover the dart-hypnotic sting, witness his own paralysis, even overhear Gibson\u2019s rescue plan via audicom.  Each incident isn\u2019t just \u201cscary\u201d; it\u2019s a step in revealing, piece by piece, the solution to the central mystery:  \n   \u2022 How do the fishers reach the islet?  \n   \u2022 Who runs the lizard-squid-fisher spectacle?  \n   \u2022 What underlies the \u201cphantom city\u201d?  \n\nII. How the nighttime exploration delivers answers  \n1. Fishers don\u2019t swim, no boats exist (p. 10):  \n   \u201con the first day \u2026 one of the pink fishers had fallen \u2026 which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some would surely have gone in \u2026 And the Marco\u2019s crew had explored Arz exhaustively \u2026 found nothing but water and a scattering of little islands \u2026\u201d  \n   That logical paradox (\u201cno boats, can\u2019t swim\u201d) only crystallizes when Farrell is alone, free of Stryker\u2019s distractions.  \n2. Discovery of the paralytic dart (p. 11):  \n   \u201cA sharp sting burned his shoulder \u2026 that sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle.\u201d  \n   This explains how the Arzians are transported under sedation\u2014key to unveiling the squid\u2019s method of \u201cangling.\u201d  \n3. Personal paralysis dramatizes the squid control (p. 12):  \n   Farrell\u2019s inability to move underscores squid supremacy.  But more than that, his sweating struggle to actuate the audicom button enables Gibson to explain, later, *why* the octopods own land and cattle:  \n   \u201cThe octopods \u2026 keep [the islands] policed \u2026 they even own the pink fishers\u201d (p. 16).  \n\nIII. The narrative layering of mystery and revelation  \n\u2022 Each \u201cdanger\u201d scene doubles as a clue: discovering no native wildlife noises at night; finding sleeping pairs; realizing those pairs vanish each dawn, replaced by corpses.  \n\u2022 The structural alternation of day\u2014and Stryker\u2019s safe oversight\u2014and night\u2014and Farrell\u2019s unchecked inquiry\u2014gives the *reader* exactly the vantage point needed: enough information to puzzle over the fishers\u2019 motivation, but not so much that the squid culture is spoiled in advance.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nBy sending Arthur out alone while Stryker slept, Dee isn\u2019t indulging in cheap thrills.  He is staging a controlled investigation: a sequence of observations, each feeding directly into the central mysteries and delivering answers at just the right moments.  Far from being mere suspense-pumping, the solo excursion is the reader\u2019s vehicle for *learning* why the Arzians fish in pairs, how they\u2019re subdued, and ultimately, how the squid-people have orchestrated it all.  That is the narrative purpose.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Any scene set at night with predators can feel suspenseful, but that emotional tone is a by-product, not the *reason* Dee sends Arthur out alone. The text systematically uses Arthur\u2019s solo trek as a research vehicle. Every moment of peril is paired with a crucial clue:  \n  \u2013 Finding sleeping pairs of Arzians (p. 11) reveals they aren\u2019t at the islet to fish.  \n  \u2013 Noticing their non-swimming after one nearly drowns (p. 10) creates the \u201cboat vs. swim\u201d paradox.  \n  \u2013 Feeling the \u201csharp sting\u201d (p. 11) pinpoints the octopus method of transport.  \nIf Dee only wanted suspense, he could have had Arthur trip over a root or face a generic predator. Instead, each hazard is calibrated to answer the reader\u2019s outstanding questions.  \n\n2. Delayed Exposition Is Strategic, Not Merely Suspense\u2010Driven  \nDebater_A claims \u201cthe text withholds answers\u201d to boost terror\u2014but actually it *stages* each answer at the precise moment Arthur is most curious:  \n  \u2022 The boat/swim conundrum *only* coalesces in the solitude of night when Stryker\u2019s off-duty (p. 10).  \n  \u2022 The anesthetic dart would mean nothing if discovered in broad daylight among the crew\u2014it\u2019s in the dark, alone, that Arthur links sting=textile.  \n  \u2022 The paralysis struggle forces readers to experience the octopods\u2019 dominion *from within*, so that Gibson\u2019s later summary (\u201cthe octopods \u2026 keep them policed.

        "speech": "I. Debater_A Confuses \u201cDanger\u201d with \u201cPurposeful Discovery\u201d  \n1. Any scene set at night with predators can feel suspenseful, but that emotional tone is a by-product, not the *reason* Dee sends Arthur out alone. The text systematically uses Arthur\u2019s solo trek as a research vehicle. Every moment of peril is paired with a crucial clue:  \n  \u2013 Finding sleeping pairs of Arzians (p. 11) reveals they aren\u2019t at the islet to fish.  \n  \u2013 Noticing their non-swimming after one nearly drowns (p. 10) creates the \u201cboat vs. swim\u201d paradox.  \n  \u2013 Feeling the \u201csharp sting\u201d (p. 11) pinpoints the octopus method of transport.  \nIf Dee only wanted suspense, he could have had Arthur trip over a root or face a generic predator. Instead, each hazard is calibrated to answer the reader\u2019s outstanding questions.  \n\n2. Delayed Exposition Is Strategic, Not Merely Suspense\u2010Driven  \nDebater_A claims \u201cthe text withholds answers\u201d to boost terror\u2014but actually it *stages* each answer at the precise moment Arthur is most curious:  \n  \u2022 The boat/swim conundrum *only* coalesces in the solitude of night when Stryker\u2019s off-duty (p. 10).  \n  \u2022 The anesthetic dart would mean nothing if discovered in broad daylight among the crew\u2014it\u2019s in the dark, alone, that Arthur links sting=textile.  \n  \u2022 The paralysis struggle forces readers to experience the octopods\u2019 dominion *from within*, so that Gibson\u2019s later summary (\u201cthe octopods \u2026 keep them policed.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the narrative purpose of having Arthur try to explore Arz while Stryker slept?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpure suspense\u201d claim  \n1. Overly reductive.  Debater_A says Arthur\u2019s solo excursion \u201cwas to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm\u2019s way.\u201d  But mere jeopardy by itself doesn\u2019t explain why the author chose *this* moment, with this particular chain of discoveries, to send Arthur out alone.  In fact, every beat of Arthur\u2019s nighttime trek is structured not just to frighten us but to supply crucial information about Arz\u2019s ecology and culture.  \n2. Suspense alone would have permitted any danger scene\u2014trapped in a cave, bitten by a lizard, shot by a squid, etc.  Instead Roger Dee has Arthur observe the sleeping pairs of Arzians, note their non-swimming, discover the dart-hypnotic sting, witness his own paralysis, even overhear Gibson\u2019s rescue plan via audicom.  Each incident isn\u2019t just \u201cscary\u201d; it\u2019s a step in revealing, piece by piece, the solution to the central mystery:  \n   \u2022 How do the fishers reach the islet?  \n   \u2022 Who runs the lizard-squid-fisher spectacle?  \n   \u2022 What underlies the \u201cphantom city\u201d?  \n\nII. How the nighttime exploration delivers answers  \n1. Fishers don\u2019t swim, no boats exist (p. 10):  \n   \u201con the first day \u2026 one of the pink fishers had fallen \u2026 which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some would surely have gone in \u2026 And the Marco\u2019s crew had explored Arz exhaustively \u2026 found nothing but water and a scattering of little islands \u2026\u201d  \n   That logical paradox (\u201cno boats, can\u2019t swim\u201d) only crystallizes when Farrell is alone, free of Stryker\u2019s distractions.  \n2.

Conclusion  \nBy sending Arthur out alone while Stryker slept, Dee isn\u2019t indulging in cheap thrills.  He is staging a controlled investigation: a sequence of observations, each feeding directly into the central mysteries and delivering answers at just the right moments.  Far from being mere suspense-pumping, the solo excursion is the reader\u2019s vehicle for *learning* why the Arzians fish in pairs, how they\u2019re subdued, and ultimately, how the squid-people have orchestrated it all.

That sudden transition from curiosity to crisis ratchets up reader anxiety.

The primary narrative purpose of Arthur\u2019s nocturnal exploration is to build suspense through placing him in mortal danger\u2014forcing readers to fear for his life and drive eagerly toward the final reveal.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpure suspense\u201d claim  \n1. Overly reductive.  Debater_A says Arthur\u2019s solo excursion \u201cwas to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm\u2019s way.\u201d  But mere jeopardy by itself doesn\u2019t explain why the author chose *this* moment, with this particular chain of discoveries, to send Arthur out alone.  In fact, every beat of Arthur\u2019s nighttime trek is structured not just to frighten us but to supply crucial information about Arz\u2019s ecology and culture.  \n2. Suspense alone would have permitted any danger scene\u2014trapped in a cave, bitten by a lizard, shot by a squid, etc.  Instead Roger Dee has Arthur observe the sleeping pairs of Arzians, note their non-swimming, discover the dart-hypnotic sting, witness his own paralysis, even overhear Gibson\u2019s rescue plan via audicom.  Each incident isn\u2019t just \u201cscary\u201d; it\u2019s a step in revealing, piece by piece, the solution to the central mystery:  \n   \u2022 How do the fishers reach the islet?  \n   \u2022 Who runs the lizard-squid-fisher spectacle?  \n   \u2022 What underlies the \u201cphantom city\u201d?  \n\nII. How the nighttime exploration delivers answers  \n1. Fishers don\u2019t swim, no boats exist (p. 10):  \n   \u201con the first day \u2026 one of the pink fishers had fallen \u2026 which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some would surely have gone in \u2026 And the Marco\u2019s crew had explored Arz exhaustively \u2026 found nothing but water and a scattering of little islands \u2026\u201d  \n   That logical paradox (\u201cno boats, can\u2019t swim\u201d) only crystallizes when Farrell is alone, free of Stryker\u2019s distractions.  \n2. Discovery of the paralytic dart (p. 11):  \n   \u201cA sharp sting burned his shoulder \u2026 that sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle.\u201d  \n   This explains how the Arzians are transported under sedation\u2014key to unveiling the squid\u2019s method of \u201cangling.\u201d  \n3. Personal paralysis dramatizes the squid control (p. 12):  \n   Farrell\u2019s inability to move underscores squid supremacy.  But more than that, his sweating struggle to actuate the audicom button enables Gibson to explain, later, *why* the octopods own land and cattle:  \n   \u201cThe octopods \u2026 keep [the islands] policed \u2026 they even own the pink fishers\u201d (p. 16).  \n\nIII. The narrative layering of mystery and revelation  \n\u2022 Each \u201cdanger\u201d scene doubles as a clue: discovering no native wildlife noises at night; finding sleeping pairs; realizing those pairs vanish each dawn, replaced by corpses.  \n\u2022 The structural alternation of day\u2014and Stryker\u2019s safe oversight\u2014and night\u2014and Farrell\u2019s unchecked inquiry\u2014gives the *reader* exactly the vantage point needed: enough information to puzzle over the fishers\u2019 motivation, but not so much that the squid culture is spoiled in advance.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nBy sending Arthur out alone while Stryker slept, Dee isn\u2019t indulging in cheap thrills.  He is staging a controlled investigation: a sequence of observations, each feeding directly into the central mysteries and delivering answers at just the right moments.  Far from being mere suspense-pumping, the solo excursion is the reader\u2019s vehicle for *learning* why the Arzians fish in pairs, how they\u2019re subdued, and ultimately, how the squid-people have orchestrated it all.  That is the narrative purpose.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B claims that Arthur\u2019s nighttime foray exists primarily to convey facts about Arz, but that reading ignores how Roger Dee structures the scene to ratchet up tension and fear. In fact, every element\u2014alone in the dark, Stryker asleep, the sting, the paralysis, the encroaching squids and dragons\u2014serves to put Arthur\u2019s life on the line. That kind of \u201cwitness\u2010the\u2010mystery\u201d approach is clearly suspense\u2010driven, not mere exposition.\n\n1. Exposition could have been delivered safely and cleanly  \n   \u2022 If Roger Dee\u2019s goal was simply to reveal the fishers\u2019 non\u2010swimming, the dart, or the squid \u201cownership,\u201d he could have had Gibson run daytime tests with the scouter or conducted interviews with the natives. Instead, he sends Arthur alone at night, armed only with a torch, heightening the reader\u2019s anxiety. That choice is gratuitously dangerous\u2014why endanger him if not to build suspense?  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s own background citations show that daylight scouting repeatedly failed to yield answers (\u201cthe scouter\u2026found nothing but water,\u201d \u201cno boats\u201d etc.). Yet nothing happens in daylight. The pivotal revelations\u2014the sting\u2019s anesthetic effect, the paralysis, the urgency of the rescue\u2014occur only in this perilous nocturnal scene. The story delays exposition until after the suspenseful crisis peaks.\n\n2. The scene\u2019s pacing and detail amplify suspense far more than they serve mere information\u2010dump  \n   \u2022 Notice how Dee lingers on Arthur\u2019s mounting panic: \u201cHis arm was like a limb of lead,\u201d \u201cHe bent every ounce of his will\u2026 and failed.\u201d These seven lines of paralysis, sweat, and desperate effort are overkill if the sole purpose were to learn that the fishers are drugged. They\u2019re there to make readers sweat for Arthur\u2019s survival.  \n   \u2022 The sudden break\u2014Arthur\u2019s scream, the flutter of wings, the circling octopods\u2014comes at the climactic moment of his helplessness. Only *then* does Gibson swoop in. That is textbook suspense structure: isolate the hero, ratchet up peril, then deliver rescue.\n\n3. Thematically, Arthur himself recognizes the scene\u2019s suspense function  \n   \u2022 He thinks to himself, \u201cDamn Terran Regulations \u2026 I\u2019ve got to know.\u201d His rash choice, fueled by reckless curiosity, places him at risk. That inner commentary isn\u2019t merely logical reasoning; it highlights his vulnerability, underscoring the scene\u2019s tension.  \n   \u2022 At the close, Arthur quips, \u201cYou don\u2019t think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\u201d That wry line ties back to his jeopardy: he almost *became* bait. The humor only lands because we\u2019ve just been made to fear for his safety.\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s step\u2010by\u2010step expository \u201cclues\u201d are incidental to the suspense  \n   \u2022 Yes, Arthur notices sleeping pairs, the lack of wildlife, the sting, etc.\u2014but each revelation arrives *through the lens of danger*. We only care about the fishers\u2019 non\u2010swimming because Arthur\u2019s life might hang on it.  \n   \u2022 The narrative doesn\u2019t pause to lecture the reader on each clue. Dee flashes them briefly in the middle of panic. That fragmented, crisis\u2010driven delivery is the hallmark of suspense writing, not of calm, orderly exposition.\n\nIn sum, while the scene incidentally answers some of the reader\u2019s questions about Arz, its dominant effect is to place Arthur in mortal peril and keep us breathlessly hoping he\u2019ll survive. That is the unmistakable narrative purpose: to build suspense by putting Arthur in harm\u2019s way. Debater_B\u2019s \u201clearning\u201d theory cannot account for the prolonged paralysis, the nocturnal isolation, or the dramatic rescue\u2014all classic suspense devices. The correct answer is: It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm\u2019s way.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A Confuses \u201cDanger\u201d with \u201cPurposeful Discovery\u201d  \n1. Any scene set at night with predators can feel suspenseful, but that emotional tone is a by-product, not the *reason* Dee sends Arthur out alone. The text systematically uses Arthur\u2019s solo trek as a research vehicle. Every moment of peril is paired with a crucial clue:  \n  \u2013 Finding sleeping pairs of Arzians (p. 11) reveals they aren\u2019t at the islet to fish.  \n  \u2013 Noticing their non-swimming after one nearly drowns (p. 10) creates the \u201cboat vs. swim\u201d paradox.  \n  \u2013 Feeling the \u201csharp sting\u201d (p. 11) pinpoints the octopus method of transport.  \nIf Dee only wanted suspense, he could have had Arthur trip over a root or face a generic predator. Instead, each hazard is calibrated to answer the reader\u2019s outstanding questions.  \n\n2. Delayed Exposition Is Strategic, Not Merely Suspense\u2010Driven  \nDebater_A claims \u201cthe text withholds answers\u201d to boost terror\u2014but actually it *stages* each answer at the precise moment Arthur is most curious:  \n  \u2022 The boat/swim conundrum *only* coalesces in the solitude of night when Stryker\u2019s off-duty (p. 10).  \n  \u2022 The anesthetic dart would mean nothing if discovered in broad daylight among the crew\u2014it\u2019s in the dark, alone, that Arthur links sting=textile.  \n  \u2022 The paralysis struggle forces readers to experience the octopods\u2019 dominion *from within*, so that Gibson\u2019s later summary (\u201cthe octopods \u2026 keep them policed. They even own the pink fishers,\u201d p. 16) resonates as *new* knowledge rather than reheated facts.  \nThose \u201cdelays\u201d are not gratuitous suspense hooks but carefully placed beats in an investigative unfolding.  \n\nII. Nighttime Excursion as Reader\u2019s Lens on the Central Mysteries  \n1. How do the fishers cross?  The nocturnal exploration is the *only* time Arthur observes their sleeping state and draws the no-boats / no-swim inference (pp. 10\u201311). This is the aha-moment the reader must share.  \n2. Who\u2019s in control?  Arthur\u2019s paralysis\u2014\u201clike a limb of lead,\u201d \u201ca tiny click\u2026 sent him faint with relief\u201d (p. 12)\u2014literally embodies the octopods\u2019 mastery. We *feel* their power before Gibson names it.  \n3. Why the city obsession?  Arthur\u2019s parallel process of piecing together clues echoes Gibson\u2019s later revelation of the submerged metropolis. The solo stakeout primes us to understand that this \u201cphantom city\u201d was underwater all along.  \n\nIII. Why Stryker Must Sleep  \nDebater_A suggests Gibson or Stryker could have done this in daylight\u2014but:  \n  \u2022 Daylight swarming by lizards and squids would have obscured the minutiae (sleeping pairs, lack of wildlife sounds).  \n  \u2022 Arthur alone, unobserved, can verify that the natives are unarmed, unalarmed\u2014an essential detail for sussing out they\u2019re not hunting but being hunted.  \nWithout Stryker asleep, there is no genuine \u201cfield experiment\u201d Arthur can conduct undisturbed, and the reader loses the step-by-step revelation.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe real narrative purpose of Arthur\u2019s unsanctioned, nighttime foray isn\u2019t to give us a quick scare\u2014it\u2019s to structure the *discovery process* for us. Each frightening beat doubles as an exposition beat, leading the reader, clue by clue, to solve the core puzzles of Arz. Suspense is simply the ambient color; the true function is pedagogical: *Arthur* learns the planet\u2019s secrets so *we* can learn them alongside him.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
