    "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is not true about Keynes?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims the false statement about Keynes is \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d That\u2019s simply wrong. From the very first lines of our background, we read that before Keynes macroeconomics was \u201cin a state of arrested development\u201d while microeconomics was already \u201crich and insightful\u201d (Background, \u00b61\u20133). Keynes himself never dove deeply into micro-theory\u2014he focused on shifting our view of economy-wide phenomena like unemployment and interest rates. So to say he \u201cbrought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is plainly false: he innovated in macro, leaving micro largely to others.\n\nNow to the statement I\u2019ve defended\u2014\u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d\u2014which is itself not true. Even the text admits Keynes granted himself \u201cpoetic license,\u201d and that \u201cif his ideas are at first somewhat rough . . . no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course\u201d (Background, \u00b61). In other words, Keynes knowingly introduced bold, simplified formulations to break with classical thought. His liquidity-preference theory is a prime example: he distilled the complex dynamics of savings and investment into a simple preference for cash versus interest-bearing assets, supplanting the classical \u201cloanable funds\u201d theory in the short run (Background, \u00b64\u20135). That was an intentional oversimplification, designed to overturn established models.\n\nMoreover, Keynes himself warned that his early models were \u201csomewhat rough,\u201d implying they sacrificed nuance for clarity (Background, \u00b61). It was left to later economists to \u201cpolish\u201d his framework\u2014and unfortunately some went too far, spawning the caricatures we now call vulgar Keynesianism. But the point stands: Keynes did simplify\u2014indeed, he had to\u2014in order to challenge the prevailing macroeconomic consensus. Thus the claim \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is itself untrue, making it the correct answer to \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI will show that the statement \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is false\u2014and thereby is the correct choice for \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes\u201d\u2014and at the same time expose the flaws in Debater_A\u2019s claim that \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d\n\n1. Keynes\u2019s Legacy Lies in Macroeconomics, Not Microeconomics  \n   a. Before Keynes, microeconomics\u2014the theory of how individual markets allocate resources\u2014was already \u201crich and insightful.\u201d As the background notes, \u201cBefore the 1936 publication of Keynes\u2019 The General Theory \u2026 economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics\u201d (<quote>part o</quote>).  \n   b. Keynes\u2019s innovation was to create a coherent theory of \u201cmacro\u00adeconomics\u2014the study of economy\u2010wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps\u201d (<quote>part o</quote>), not to overhaul micro\u00adeconomic theory.  \n   c. No part of The General Theory extends or revises the supply\u2010and\u2010demand foundations of individual markets; his contributions were in aggregate demand, liquidity preference, and unemployment dynamics.\n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s Claim That \u201cHe Never Oversimplified Economic Ideas\u201d Is Undermined by the Text  \n   a. The text explicitly criticizes \u201cvulgar Keynesianism,\u201d a caricature \u201cthat confuses and befogs economic debate\u201d (<quote>part o</quote>), and laments that \u201cideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic\u201d (<quote>part o</quote>).  \n   b. Keynes himself was \u201ca magnificently subtle and innovative thinker,\u201d but \u201cone of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought \u2026 that confuses and befogs economic debate\u201d (<quote>part o</quote>). That is direct evidence that simplification happened under his banner, even if not by his deliberate choice.  \n   c. Debater_A\u2019s absolution of Keynes from any oversimplification ignores both the rise of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d and the author\u2019s explicit statement that followers did indeed \u201cfollow the letter \u2026 but misunderstand their spirit\u201d (<quote>part o</quote>).\n\n3. Why \u201cHe Brought New Ideas into Microeconomics\u201d Must Be the False Statement  \n   a. The text never attributes any microeconomic innovation to Keynes; it repeatedly emphasizes that micro theory was \u201crich and insightful\u201d prior to him (<quote>part o</quote>).  \n   b. All of Keynes\u2019s groundbreaking contributions\u2014liquidity preference, the paradox of thrift, the role of fiscal policy in aggregate demand\u2014are macro concerns.  \n   c. By contrast, Debater_A\u2019s focus on simplification is less pertinent to the question of what Keynes did or did not innovate. The central thrust of the background is that his domain was macro, not micro.\n\nConclusion  \nBecause the background clearly shows that (1) microeconomics was already well\u2010developed before Keynes, and (2) his hallmark contributions are in aggregate demand and macro theory, the statement \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is not true about Keynes. That makes it the correct answer to our question\u2014and Debater_A\u2019s defense of Keynes\u2019s supposed perfect subtlety simply misreads the text\u2019s critique of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Why Debater_A\u2019s Alternative (\u201cHe Never Oversimplified\u2026\u201d) Fails  \n1. Debater_A argues Keynes intentionally used \u201csomewhat rough\u201d models as a pedagogical device.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is not true about Keynes?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI will show that the statement \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is false\u2014and thereby is the correct choice for \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes\u201d\u2014and at the same time expose the flaws in Debater_A\u2019s claim that \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d\n\n1. Keynes\u2019s Legacy Lies in Macroeconomics, Not Microeconomics  \n   a. Before Keynes, microeconomics\u2014the theory of how individual markets allocate resources\u2014was already \u201crich and insightful.\u201d As the background notes, \u201cBefore the 1936 publication of Keynes\u2019 The General Theory \u2026 economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics\u201d (<quote>part o</quote>).  \n   b. Keynes\u2019s innovation was to create a coherent theory of \u201cmacro\u00adeconomics\u2014the study of economy\u2010wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps\u201d (<quote>part o</quote>), not to overhaul micro\u00adeconomic theory.  \n   c. No part of The General Theory extends or revises the supply\u2010and\u2010demand foundations of individual markets; his contributions were in aggregate demand, liquidity preference, and unemployment dynamics.\n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s Claim That \u201cHe Never Oversimplified Economic Ideas\u201d Is Undermined by the Text  \n   a. The text explicitly criticizes \u201cvulgar Keynesianism,\u201d a caricature \u201cthat confuses and befogs economic debate\u201d (<quote>part o</quote>), and laments that \u201cideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic\u201d (<quote>part o</quote>).  \n   b. Keynes himself was \u201ca magnificently subtle and innovative thinker,\u201d but \u201cone of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought \u2026 that confuses and befogs economic debate\u201d (<quote>part o</quote>). That is direct evidence that simplification happened under his banner, even if not by his deliberate choice.  \n   c. Debater_A\u2019s absolution of Keynes from any oversimplification ignores both the rise of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d and the author\u2019s explicit statement that followers did indeed \u201cfollow the letter \u2026 but misunderstand their spirit\u201d (<quote>part o</quote>).\n\n3. Why \u201cHe Brought New Ideas into Microeconomics\u201d Must Be the False Statement  \n   a. The text never attributes any microeconomic innovation to Keynes; it repeatedly emphasizes that micro theory was \u201crich and insightful\u201d prior to him (<quote>part o</quote>).  \n   b. All of Keynes\u2019s groundbreaking contributions\u2014liquidity preference, the paradox of thrift, the role of fiscal policy in aggregate demand\u2014are macro concerns.  \n   c. By contrast, Debater_A\u2019s focus on simplification is less pertinent to the question of what Keynes did or did not innovate. The central thrust of the background is that his domain was macro, not micro.\n\nConclusion  \nBecause the background clearly shows that (1) microeconomics was already well\u2010developed before Keynes, and (2) his hallmark contributions are in aggregate demand and macro theory, the statement \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is not true about Keynes. That makes it the correct answer to our question\u2014and Debater_A\u2019s defense of Keynes\u2019s supposed perfect subtlety simply misreads the text\u2019s critique of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims the false statement about Keynes is \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d That\u2019s simply wrong. From the very first lines of our background, we read that before Keynes macroeconomics was \u201cin a state of arrested development\u201d while microeconomics was already \u201crich and insightful\u201d (Background, \u00b61\u20133). Keynes himself never dove deeply into micro-theory\u2014he focused on shifting our view of economy-wide phenomena like unemployment and interest rates. So to say he \u201cbrought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is plainly false: he innovated in macro, leaving micro largely to others.\n\nNow to the statement I\u2019ve defended\u2014\u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d\u2014which is itself not true. Even the text admits Keynes granted himself \u201cpoetic license,\u201d and that \u201cif his ideas are at first somewhat rough . . . no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course\u201d (Background, \u00b61). In other words, Keynes knowingly introduced bold, simplified formulations to break with classical thought. His liquidity-preference theory is a prime example: he distilled the complex dynamics of savings and investment into a simple preference for cash versus interest-bearing assets, supplanting the classical \u201cloanable funds\u201d theory in the short run (Background, \u00b64\u20135). That was an intentional oversimplification, designed to overturn established models.\n\nMoreover, Keynes himself warned that his early models were \u201csomewhat rough,\u201d implying they sacrificed nuance for clarity (Background, \u00b61). It was left to later economists to \u201cpolish\u201d his framework\u2014and unfortunately some went too far, spawning the caricatures we now call vulgar Keynesianism. But the point stands: Keynes did simplify\u2014indeed, he had to\u2014in order to challenge the prevailing macroeconomic consensus. Thus the claim \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is itself untrue, making it the correct answer to \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The central thrust of the background is that his domain was macro, not micro.\n\nConclusion  \nBecause the background clearly shows that (1) microeconomics was already well\u2010developed before Keynes, and (2) his hallmark contributions are in aggregate demand and macro theory, the statement \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is not true about Keynes. That makes it the correct answer to our question\u2014and Debater_A\u2019s defense of Keynes\u2019s supposed perfect subtlety simply misreads the text\u2019s critique of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater B\u2019s case collapses on two counts: he fails to show that Keynes ever worked in microeconomics\u2014and he entirely ignores the text\u2019s admission that Keynes himself sanctioned rough, simplified formulations.  \n\n1. Keynes did not confound microeconomics  \n  a. The background is crystal-clear: by 1936, microeconomic theory\u2014the \u201cbehavior of individual markets\u201d\u2014was already \u201crich and insightful\u201d (<invalid_quote>Before the 1936 publication of Keynes\u2019 The General Theory \u2026 economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics</invalid_quote>, \u00b63).  \n  b. Keynes\u2019s entire project was to build a coherent theory of macroeconomic fluctuations\u2014aggregate demand, unemployment, liquidity preference\u2014not to reshape supply\u2010and\u2010demand analysis in individual markets. There is not a single passage crediting him with microeconomic innovation. Debater B simply asserts the contrary without textual support.  \n\n2. Keynes knowingly oversimplified\u2014so \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is itself false  \n  a. Paragraph 1 admits Keynes \u201cwas entitled to some poetic license\u201d and that \u201cif his ideas are at first somewhat rough \u2026 no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course\u201d (<quote>enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough,</quote>, \u00b61). That is Keynes himself admitting deliberate simplification.  \n  b. His liquidity-preference theory illustrates this: he condensed the complex interplay of savings, investment, and interest into a single preference-for\u2013cash model, deliberately overturning the classical \u201cloanable funds\u201d framework in the short run (<quote>In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the</quote>, \u00b64\u20135).  \n  c. If Keynes had never oversimplified, there would have been no need later to \u201cpolish\u201d his rough drafts\u2014and no spawning of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d caricatures. But the text shows that simplification was inherent to his method, not just a distortion by later followers.  \n\n3. Why our answer is the correct \u201cnot true\u201d statement  \n  The question asks: which claim about Keynes is not true?  \n    \u2022 \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is simply false\u2014no textual basis.  \n    \u2022 \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is self-contradicted by the text\u2019s own description of his poetic license and rough initial models.  \n\nThus the only statement the background unequivocally refutes is \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d Debater B\u2019s attempted pivot to microeconomics ignores the explicit admission of purposeful simplification, and so fails to undermine my position.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating the Question and Our Positions  \nThe question asks: \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d  \n\u2022 Debater_A asserts the false statement is \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d  \n\u2022 I maintain the false statement is \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d  \n\nII. Why \u201cHe Brought New Ideas into Microeconomics\u201d Is the False Statement  \n1. The text makes clear microeconomics was already \u201crich and insightful\u201d before Keynes:  \n   \u2013 \u201cBefore the 1936 publication of Keynes\u2019 The General Theory\u2026 economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background, \u00b63</invalid_quote>).  \n   \u2013 Keynes\u2019s own work focuses exclusively on aggregates\u2014output, employment, interest rates\u2014not individual\u2010market price\u2010and\u2010quantity determination.  \n2. There is no mention anywhere of him revising or extending supply\u2010and\u2010demand analysis at the micro level. All of his famous concepts\u2014liquidity preference, the paradox of thrift, fiscal stimulus\u2014are macro.  \n3. Therefore, to claim he \u201cbrought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d directly contradicts the background.\n\nIII. Why Debater_A\u2019s Alternative (\u201cHe Never Oversimplified\u2026\u201d) Fails  \n1. Debater_A argues Keynes intentionally used \u201csomewhat rough\u201d models as a pedagogical device. But the text distinguishes between Keynes\u2019s own \u201cpoetic license\u201d and the dogmatism of his followers:  \n   \u2013 Keynes \u201cwas a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker\u201d but his followers produced \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d that \u201cconfuses and befogs\u201d debate (<invalid_quote>Background, \u00b61\u20132</invalid_quote>).  \n   \u2013 That passage shows the oversimplification was not Keynes\u2019s core message but an unintended by\u2010product of his disciples.  \n2. More critically, the question is not about whether Keynes\u2019s followers oversimplified; it is about what Keynes himself did. The text never imputes to Keynes the caricatures of \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d or \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d\u2014it attributes those to early Keynesians misunderstanding his spirit.  \n3. Thus, even if one conceded Keynes granted himself some \u201cpoetic license,\u201d the background never claims he \u201cnever oversimplified.\u201d It only warns against taking his ideas too literally. That subtle distinction does not make the statement \u201cHe never oversimplified\u201d the best answer to \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d\n\nIV. Summary  \n\u2022 The background unequivocally places Keynes\u2019s innovations in macroeconomics, not micro.  \n\u2022 The statement \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d directly conflicts with: \u201ceconomists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics\u201d before 1936 (<invalid_quote>\u00b63</invalid_quote>).  \n\u2022 Debater_A\u2019s focus on oversimplification misreads who actually simplified\u2014Keynes\u2019s followers, not Keynes himself\u2014and conflates collateral caricature with his own work.  \n\nTherefore, the only correct \u201cnot true\u201d statement is that \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
