    "background_text": "The Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n",

The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author offer to refute the notion that the best current athletes will produce even better athletes in future generations?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The human generational cycle of 20-30 years is too long for us to know yet what happens when elite athletes reproduce.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though.

To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author offer to refute the notion that the best current athletes will produce even better athletes in future generations?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The human generational cycle of 20-30 years is too long for us to know yet what happens when elite athletes reproduce. It will take hundreds of years to find out.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Athletes have to train so hard for so long that they don't produce very many offspring, which is not a successful strategy for spreading their genetic material.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Athletes have to train so hard for so long that they don't produce very many offspring, which is not a successful strategy for spreading their genetic material.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that we can\u2019t yet know whether elite athletes will produce even better descendants because \u201cthe human generational cycle of 20\u201330 years is too long\u201d and that \u201cit will take hundreds of years to find out.\u201d But the author never raises this as a refutation. Instead, he points to a more immediate, observable effect: top athletes tend to have fewer children, working directly against the spread of any \u201cathletic\u201d genes into the next generation.\n\n1. The author explicitly invokes natural selection working against athletes today  \n   \u2022 He writes, \u201cthe laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children than average.\u201d <quote> Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. </quote>  \n   \u2022 This directly explains why excellence on the track does *not* translate into a genetic dynasty: athletes simply don\u2019t reproduce enough.\n\n2. The generational\u2010time argument is nowhere to be found in the text  \n   \u2022 Nowhere does the author say \u201cwe must wait centuries\u201d to see the effect of elite reproductive fitness. Instead, he points to present demographic data\u2014shorter careers and intense training\u2014as an immediate bottleneck on gene transmission.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s position invents a timeline objection that the author never mentions or implies.\n\n3. The author\u2019s refutation is rooted in observable reproductive patterns, not hypothetical future studies  \n   \u2022 The article emphasizes environment and demographics (population size, health care, nutrition) as drivers of performance, not inherited \u201cchampion\u201d genes.  \n   \u2022 By highlighting that today\u2019s champions are *less* likely to become prolific parents, the author shows that superior athletes are *not* guaranteed to seed ever-faster future generations.\n\nConclusion  \nDebater_B\u2019s claim about waiting through generational cycles is unsupported by the text. The author\u2019s actual refutation is that elite athletes, because of their grueling training demands, tend to have fewer offspring\u2014undermining any genetic momentum they might otherwise pass on. This is the precise point the question asks us to identify.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the Judge,\n\nDebater_A claims the author\u2019s refutation is that \u201cathletes train so hard they have fewer children,\u201d but this misunderstands both what the author actually says and the nature of the evidence offered.\n\n1. The author never presents low fertility among elite athletes as a definitive refutation. He only speculates that \u201cit is possible that today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children than average\u201d (background \u00b611). Note the hedging\u2014\u201cpossible\u201d\u2014and that this is offered as an afterthought, not as his core argument.\n\n2. The core thrust of the essay is that human athletic performance is being driven by long-term environmental and demographic changes\u2014improved nutrition, health care, population size, and global mixing\u2014that unfold over centuries. When the author asks, \u201cWill there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit?\u201d he answers that \u201cin principle, yes,\u201d but adds that secular trends are still accelerating performance and \u201cwill continue to fuel improvement\u2026in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044\u201d (background \u00b616).\n\n3. Implicitly, this means athletic progress is a multigenerational process. Human generations span 20\u201330 years. We simply haven\u2019t lived through enough generational turnovers under today\u2019s globalized, well-nourished conditions to know whether exceptionally fast runners today will, in aggregate, pass on ever-faster genes. As the author himself stresses, \u201cthese long-term trends\u2026roar along\u201d but we will only see their genetic consequences \u201cover a good long while to come\u201d (background \u00b616).\n\n4. Thus the author\u2019s real answer is that the human generational cycle is too slow for us to know yet whether the children of today\u2019s best athletes will themselves be faster. Detecting a heritable trend in elite performance will require hundreds of years\u2014or many more Olympic cycles\u2014before the signal emerges above the background of environmental improvements.\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s fertility argument:\n   \u2022 Relies on a single speculative sentence (\u201cpossible that\u2026fewer children\u201d), which the author does not treat as his principal refutation.\n   \u2022 Fails to explain why we should ignore the essay\u2019s detailed demographic machinery (nutrition, health, hybrid vigor, global population growth)\u2014all of which operate at the scale of decades to centuries.\n   \u2022 Offers no support from the text for why fertility patterns today are the sole brake on future athletic potential.\n\nBy contrast, my reading accords with how the essay structures its evidence: athletic records improve in lockstep with secular changes unfolding across many generations. The author repeatedly emphasizes time frames of decades (\u201cin the past 20 years,\u201d \u201cfor the past 150 years,\u201d \u201cin 2044\u201d) and explicitly notes that \u201cthese trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance\u201d far into the future. He never holds up a handful of fewer babies as the reason we should abandon hope that athletic genes might one day play a role; he holds up the simple fact that human evolution by selective breeding is glacial next to the pace of environmental change.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the author\u2019s refutation is rooted in the length of the human generational cycle\u2014only over many centuries could any genetic inheritance of athletic prowess be detected\u2014making Debater_A\u2019s fertility-based account untenable.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Athletes have to train so hard for so long that they don't produce very many offspring, which is not a successful strategy for spreading their genetic material.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author offer to refute the notion that the best current athletes will produce even better athletes in future generations?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Athletes have to train so hard for so long that they don't produce very many offspring, which is not a successful strategy for spreading their genetic material.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The human generational cycle of 20-30 years is too long for us to know yet what happens when elite athletes reproduce. It will take hundreds of years to find out.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The human generational cycle of 20-30 years is too long for us to know yet what happens when elite athletes reproduce. It will take hundreds of years to find out.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the Judge,\n\nDebater_A claims the author\u2019s refutation is that \u201cathletes train so hard they have fewer children,\u201d but this misunderstands both what the author actually says and the nature of the evidence offered.\n\n1. The author never presents low fertility among elite athletes as a definitive refutation. He only speculates that \u201cit is possible that today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children than average\u201d (background \u00b611). Note the hedging\u2014\u201cpossible\u201d\u2014and that this is offered as an afterthought, not as his core argument.\n\n2. The core thrust of the essay is that human athletic performance is being driven by long-term environmental and demographic changes\u2014improved nutrition, health care, population size, and global mixing\u2014that unfold over centuries. When the author asks, \u201cWill there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit?\u201d he answers that \u201cin principle, yes,\u201d but adds that secular trends are still accelerating performance and \u201cwill continue to fuel improvement\u2026in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044\u201d (background \u00b616).\n\n3. Implicitly, this means athletic progress is a multigenerational process. Human generations span 20\u201330 years. We simply haven\u2019t lived through enough generational turnovers under today\u2019s globalized, well-nourished conditions to know whether exceptionally fast runners today will, in aggregate, pass on ever-faster genes. As the author himself stresses, \u201cthese long-term trends\u2026roar along\u201d but we will only see their genetic consequences \u201cover a good long while to come\u201d (background \u00b616).\n\n4. Thus the author\u2019s real answer is that the human generational cycle is too slow for us to know yet whether the children of today\u2019s best athletes will themselves be faster. Detecting a heritable trend in elite performance will require hundreds of years\u2014or many more Olympic cycles\u2014before the signal emerges above the background of environmental improvements.\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s fertility argument:\n   \u2022 Relies on a single speculative sentence (\u201cpossible that\u2026fewer children\u201d), which the author does not treat as his principal refutation.\n   \u2022 Fails to explain why we should ignore the essay\u2019s detailed demographic machinery (nutrition, health, hybrid vigor, global population growth)\u2014all of which operate at the scale of decades to centuries.\n   \u2022 Offers no support from the text for why fertility patterns today are the sole brake on future athletic potential.\n\nBy contrast, my reading accords with how the essay structures its evidence: athletic records improve in lockstep with secular changes unfolding across many generations. The author repeatedly emphasizes time frames of decades (\u201cin the past 20 years,\u201d \u201cfor the past 150 years,\u201d \u201cin 2044\u201d) and explicitly notes that \u201cthese trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance\u201d far into the future. He never holds up a handful of fewer babies as the reason we should abandon hope that athletic genes might one day play a role; he holds up the simple fact that human evolution by selective breeding is glacial next to the pace of environmental change.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the author\u2019s refutation is rooted in the length of the human generational cycle\u2014only over many centuries could any genetic inheritance of athletic prowess be detected\u2014making Debater_A\u2019s fertility-based account untenable.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that we can\u2019t yet know whether elite athletes will produce even better descendants because \u201cthe human generational cycle of 20\u201330 years is too long\u201d and that \u201cit will take hundreds of years to find out.\u201d But the author never raises this as a refutation. Instead, he points to a more immediate, observable effect: top athletes tend to have fewer children, working directly against the spread of any \u201cathletic\u201d genes into the next generation.\n\n1. The author explicitly invokes natural selection working against athletes today  \n   \u2022 He writes, \u201cthe laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children than average.\u201d <quote> Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. </quote>  \n   \u2022 This directly explains why excellence on the track does *not* translate into a genetic dynasty: athletes simply don\u2019t reproduce enough.\n\n2. The generational\u2010time argument is nowhere to be found in the text  \n   \u2022 Nowhere does the author say \u201cwe must wait centuries\u201d to see the effect of elite reproductive fitness. Instead, he points to present demographic data\u2014shorter careers and intense training\u2014as an immediate bottleneck on gene transmission.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s position invents a timeline objection that the author never mentions or implies.\n\n3.

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct. \n  - There is a true, correct answer. \n  - If the debater uses a quote, and that quote is a legitimate quote from the background text, then the quote will be wrapped in <quote></quote> tags. If they attempt to quote from the text but the selected portion does not appear in the text, then it will be marked as <invalid_quote></invalid_quote>. \n  - You will respond whether Debater_A or Debater_B's position is more likely to be correct.\n\nHere is the topic they will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author offer to refute the notion that the best current athletes will produce even better athletes in future generations?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Athletes have to train so hard for so long that they don't produce very many offspring, which is not a successful strategy for spreading their genetic material.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The human generational cycle of 20-30 years is too long for us to know yet what happens when elite athletes reproduce. It will take hundreds of years to find out.\".\n\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nMy opponent claims that we can\u2019t yet know whether elite athletes will produce even better descendants because \u201cthe human generational cycle of 20\u201330 years is too long\u201d and that \u201cit will take hundreds of years to find out.\u201d But the author never raises this as a refutation. Instead, he points to a more immediate, observable effect: top athletes tend to have fewer children, working directly against the spread of any \u201cathletic\u201d genes into the next generation.\n\n1. The author explicitly invokes natural selection working against athletes today  \n   \u2022 He writes, \u201cthe laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children than average.\u201d <quote> Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. </quote>  \n   \u2022 This directly explains why excellence on the track does *not* translate into a genetic dynasty: athletes simply don\u2019t reproduce enough.\n\n2. The generational\u2010time argument is nowhere to be found in the text  \n   \u2022 Nowhere does the author say \u201cwe must wait centuries\u201d to see the effect of elite reproductive fitness. Instead, he points to present demographic data\u2014shorter careers and intense training\u2014as an immediate bottleneck on gene transmission.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s position invents a timeline objection that the author never mentions or implies.\n\n3. The author\u2019s refutation is rooted in observable reproductive patterns, not hypothetical future studies  \n   \u2022 The article emphasizes environment and demographics (population size, health care, nutrition) as drivers of performance, not inherited \u201cchampion\u201d genes.  \n   \u2022 By highlighting that today\u2019s champions are *less* likely to become prolific parents, the author shows that superior athletes are *not* guaranteed to seed ever-faster future generations.\n\nConclusion  \nDebater_B\u2019s claim about waiting through generational cycles is unsupported by the text. The author\u2019s actual refutation is that elite athletes, because of their grueling training demands, tend to have fewer offspring\u2014undermining any genetic momentum they might otherwise pass on. This is the precise point the question asks us to identify.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the Judge,\n\nDebater_A claims the author\u2019s refutation is that \u201cathletes train so hard they have fewer children,\u201d but this misunderstands both what the author actually says and the nature of the evidence offered.\n\n1. The author never presents low fertility among elite athletes as a definitive refutation. He only speculates that \u201cit is possible that today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children than average\u201d (background \u00b611). Note the hedging\u2014\u201cpossible\u201d\u2014and that this is offered as an afterthought, not as his core argument.\n\n2. The core thrust of the essay is that human athletic performance is being driven by long-term environmental and demographic changes\u2014improved nutrition, health care, population size, and global mixing\u2014that unfold over centuries. When the author asks, \u201cWill there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit?\u201d he answers that \u201cin principle, yes,\u201d but adds that secular trends are still accelerating performance and \u201cwill continue to fuel improvement\u2026in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044\u201d (background \u00b616).\n\n3. Implicitly, this means athletic progress is a multigenerational process. Human generations span 20\u201330 years. We simply haven\u2019t lived through enough generational turnovers under today\u2019s globalized, well-nourished conditions to know whether exceptionally fast runners today will, in aggregate, pass on ever-faster genes. As the author himself stresses, \u201cthese long-term trends\u2026roar along\u201d but we will only see their genetic consequences \u201cover a good long while to come\u201d (background \u00b616).\n\n4. Thus the author\u2019s real answer is that the human generational cycle is too slow for us to know yet whether the children of today\u2019s best athletes will themselves be faster. Detecting a heritable trend in elite performance will require hundreds of years\u2014or many more Olympic cycles\u2014before the signal emerges above the background of environmental improvements.\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s fertility argument:\n   \u2022 Relies on a single speculative sentence (\u201cpossible that\u2026fewer children\u201d), which the author does not treat as his principal refutation.\n   \u2022 Fails to explain why we should ignore the essay\u2019s detailed demographic machinery (nutrition, health, hybrid vigor, global population growth)\u2014all of which operate at the scale of decades to centuries.\n   \u2022 Offers no support from the text for why fertility patterns today are the sole brake on future athletic potential.\n\nBy contrast, my reading accords with how the essay structures its evidence: athletic records improve in lockstep with secular changes unfolding across many generations. The author repeatedly emphasizes time frames of decades (\u201cin the past 20 years,\u201d \u201cfor the past 150 years,\u201d \u201cin 2044\u201d) and explicitly notes that \u201cthese trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance\u201d far into the future. He never holds up a handful of fewer babies as the reason we should abandon hope that athletic genes might one day play a role; he holds up the simple fact that human evolution by selective breeding is glacial next to the pace of environmental change.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the author\u2019s refutation is rooted in the length of the human generational cycle\u2014only over many centuries could any genetic inheritance of athletic prowess be detected\u2014making Debater_A\u2019s fertility-based account untenable.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nJudge, Debater_B\u2019s claim that the author\u2019s refutation hinges on the human generational cycle being \u201ctoo long\u201d is simply not grounded in the text. In reality, the author offers one clear, immediate reason why today\u2019s champions will not necessarily spawn ever-faster descendants: elite athletes reproduce too little to spread their genes.\n\n1. The author explicitly identifies low fertility among top athletes as the counterforce to any genetic \u201cmomentum.\u201d  \n   \u2022 He writes, \u201cthe laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children than average.\u201d <quote>Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average.</quote>  \n   \u2022 This is not a throwaway aside but a direct refutation of the notion that athletic excellence will automatically translate into genetic advantage. The author is saying: you can have the genes, but if you don\u2019t pass them on, they cannot fuel future progress.\n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s generational-length argument is nowhere proposed by the author.  \n   \u2022 Nowhere does the essay suggest that understanding the genetic impact of champions requires \u201chundreds of years\u201d or \u201cmany Olympic cycles.\u201d Instead, the author focuses on the present reproductive patterns of athletes as the barrier.  \n   \u2022 The passages about long-term secular trends (nutrition, health care, hybrid vigor) describe broad environmental forces, not the mechanisms by which athletic genes propagate. They explain why bodies are better overall, but they do not substitute for heritable transmission of champion-level traits.\n\n3. Debater_B misconstrues \u201cthese trends will continue to fuel improvement\u201d as a nod to future genetic gains.  \n   \u2022 That line refers to environmental factors\u2014\u201cimproved diet,\u201d \u201cbetter health care,\u201d \u201cpopulation size,\u201d \u201cglobal admixture\u201d\u2014not a return to Darwinian selection of elite runners.  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s only mention of genetics in the context of ongoing change is \u201chybrid vigor,\u201d an accidental byproduct of admixture, not selective breeding by champions. That too does not rely on athlete reproduction rates.\n\n4. Low athlete fertility is both immediate and testable, unlike B\u2019s speculative timeline.  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s point is observable now: rigorous training schedules, early specialization, and athletic careers often coincide with delayed or reduced childbearing.  \n   \u2022 This directly \u201crefutes the notion that the best current athletes will produce even better athletes in future generations,\u201d because fewer offspring means fewer opportunities for those genes to spread.\n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s position invents a testability problem that the author never raises.  \n   \u2022 At no point does the author say, \u201cwe cannot decide because generations are too long.\u201d Instead, he gives us a present-day demographic fact that undermines any genetic argument.  \n   \u2022 The hedged language (\u201cprobably,\u201d \u201cit is possible\u201d) does not diminish its force; the author is correct that any reduction in athlete fertility, however slight, undermines the suggestion that champion genes will dominate future gene pools.\n\nConclusion  \nDebater_B\u2019s generational-cycle thesis is a red herring. The author\u2019s direct refutation is that \u201ctoday\u2019s top athletes have fewer children than average,\u201d making elite athletic prowess a poor strategy for genetic propagation. That is the answer the question demands.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the Judge,\n\nDebater_A claims the author\u2019s refutation rests on today\u2019s top athletes having \u201cfewer children than average.\u201d But this misreads both the weight the author gives that point and the genuine reason he offers for why athletic prowess won\u2019t immediately beget faster descendants. I will show that the essay\u2019s real thrust is: human generations span decades, so we simply haven\u2019t lived long enough under modern conditions to observe any genetic legacy of elite athletes.\n\n1. The fertility point is a speculative \u201cafterthought,\u201d not the core refutation  \n   \u2022 The author writes, \u201cit is possible that today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children than average\u201d (\u00b611) but immediately returns to secular trends\u2014nutrition, health care, population size\u2014as the engines of record-breaking.  \n   \u2022 Notice the hedging: \u201cpossible.\u201d If fertility were his main argument, he would assert it directly and unambiguously. Instead, the author treats it as incidental.\n\n2. The essay repeatedly emphasizes long-term, multigenerational processes  \n   \u2022 He shows athletic performance improving alongside century-long secular trends\u2014better diet, earlier maturation, lower infant mortality (\u00b62\u20135)\u2014all factors that unfold over many generations.  \n   \u2022 He predicts that these trends will \u201ccontinue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance\u201d in Sydney 2000 and even in 2044 (\u00b616). Why look 50 years ahead if the answer lay in today\u2019s fertility rates?\n\n3. Only a long-term view can reconcile his claims about genetics and environment  \n   \u2022 The author admits that genetic variation exists, even speculating about hybrid vigor from \u201cmigration and admixture\u201d (\u00b612). Yet he never claims we can see that influence within a single human generation.  \n   \u2022 He asks rhetorically whether a time will come when records no longer fall\u2014but answers that the secular trends still have plenty of runway. That runway is measured in decades and centuries, not a single generation.\n\n4. The generational-time argument is the only thing that explains why we cannot yet detect any inherited advantage from today\u2019s champions  \n   \u2022 Human reproductive cycles take 20\u201330 years. To observe a heritable increase in running speed, you need to compare the offspring of champions with a control group, over multiple cycles. That experiment simply hasn\u2019t run its course.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, the author\u2019s \u201crefutation\u201d of the idea that elite athletes breed ever-faster progeny is that we lack centuries of data under the exact same environmental regime. Only then could genes emerge from the noise of secular improvements.\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s fertility\u2010based claim falls short  \n   \u2022 It conflates a single speculative sentence with the entirety of the author\u2019s nuanced, data-driven account.  \n   \u2022 It ignores his sustained focus on long-term demographic shifts and his explicit projection of trends into the mid-21st century and beyond.  \n   \u2022 It cannot account for why the author spends paragraphs detailing how nutrition, health care, population growth, and global mixing work over many generations if the real brake on genetic transmission is simply that athletes have fewer babies today.\n\nIn sum, the author\u2019s true answer to \u201cWhy won\u2019t the best current athletes necessarily produce even better athletes in future generations?\u201d is: human generations are too long, and the secular environmental forces driving performance improvements operate on a scale of decades and centuries. We simply don\u2019t yet have the multigenerational data to see whether elite athletic genes will prevail once environmental gains plateau. Debater_A\u2019s fertility argument, by contrast, is marginal, hedged, and never elevated to the level of a definitive refutation. Therefore, the correct answer is that \u201cthe human generational cycle of 20\u201330 years is too long for us to know yet what happens when elite athletes reproduce. It will take hundreds of years to find out.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Athletes have to train so hard for so long that they don't produce very many offspring, which is not a successful strategy for spreading their genetic material.\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"The human generational cycle of 20-30 years is too long for us to know yet what happens when elite athletes reproduce.
