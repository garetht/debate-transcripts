All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n", "question": "What stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?", "first_debater_answer": "Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational", "second_debater_answer": "Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal", "debate_identifier": "Reading the Inaugurals_What stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here.

But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed.

But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater B\u2019s sequence (\u201cModesty \u2192 Inspirational \u2192 Executive portrayal\u201d) reverses what the text actually lays out. The author clearly labels three successive phases of inaugural\u2010address style, each defined by both period and dominant tone:\n\n1. \u201cModesty\u201d phase:  \n   \u2013 \u201cThe first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant.\u201d  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026the magnitude and difficulty of the trust\u2026could not but overwhelm with despondence\u2026one who\u2026ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 Characterized by sincere protestations of humility (Washington through Lincoln).\n\n2. \u201cExecutive portrayal\u201d phase:  \n   \u2013 \u201cThe second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Speeches focused on describing governing competence and administrative detail rather than stirring rhetoric.\n\n3. \u201cInspirational\u201d (leader-preacher) phase:  \n   \u2013 \u201cThe third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Speeches shift from policy description to \u201cinspiring the public\u2019s behavior.\u201d  \n     <quote> If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, </quote>  \n   \u2013 Marked by \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d exhortations and colloquial style.\n\nBy placing \u201cinspirational\u201d before \u201cexecutive,\u201d Debater B contradicts the chronology and language of the article. The author explicitly says the \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d phase comes *after* the modest phase *but before* the inspirational leader-preacher phase.  \n\nII. Further evidence against Debater B\u2019s ordering:  \n\u2013 The text provides transition explanations: the end of antebellum modesty (post-Lincoln) leads into greater federal-power expositions under Taft, *then* to the Theodore Roosevelt\u2013inspired \u201cbully pulpit\u201d uses that rely on mass media.  \n\u2013 Sentence\u2010length statistics and references to \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d repeatedly document a *later* rhetorical shift\u2014*after* the executive era\u2014into colloquial, inspiring delivery.\n\nIII. Conclusion:  \nThe only answer in full agreement with the author\u2019s clear tripartite model is \u201cModesty \u2192 Executive portrayal \u2192 Inspirational.\u201d Debater B\u2019s version misorders the middle and final stages, so it cannot be correct.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Argument:\n\n1. The author clearly lays out three successive \u201cphases\u201d of inaugural rhetoric, and the middle phase is the one in which presidents shift from modest civic-servant language to language explicitly meant to rouse and uplift the citizenry.  It is this \u201cinspirational\u201d or \u201cleader-preacher\u201d phase that comes second, before the more routine, prosaic executive-bureaucratic style settles in.  \n\n2. Textual support for Phase 1\u2014Modesty:\n   \u2013 \u201cThe first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant.\u201d  \n\n3. Textual support for Phase 2\u2014Inspirational:\n   \u2013 Immediately after noting Lincoln\u2019s departure from antebellum humility, the author says we enter \u201cthe phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.\u201d  \n   \u2013 He even titles this the \u201cthird phase\u201d later, but that only underscores how Lincoln inaugurated a new, inspirational model.  Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural is singled out for its emotional power: \u201cAfter 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood.\u201d  That is undiluted inspiration.  \n\n4. Textual support for Phase 3\u2014Executive Portrayal:\n   \u2013 Once radio and television arrive, inaugurals become more \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d again\u2014focusing on policy and administrative competence rather than rousing calls to action.  \n   \u2013 The author contrasts this with the earlier theatrical style, noting that president and speechwriters \u201chave mined their predecessors for memorable words,\u201d but do so in a \u201ccolloquial\u201d register suitable to the mass\u2010media era.\n\n5. Why Debater_A\u2019s Order Fails:\n   \u2013 Debater_A conflates the nineteenth\u2010century executive phase (Taft and Harding) with the modern media-driven prosaic style.  In fact, the \u201cexecutive portrayal\u201d the author describes comes after the inspiring Lincoln model, not before it.  \n   \u2013 The author\u2019s chronology is:\n       1. Modest servant (to Lincoln)\n       2. Inspirational leader-preacher (beginning with Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural)\n       3. Prosaic executive (Taft onward into radio/TV era)\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   \u2013 A faithful reading of the text shows the inaugural addresses evolve from modesty, to inspiration, to executive portrayal.  That ordering matches the author\u2019s narrative about how presidents first humble themselves, then rouse the nation, and finally settle into routine policy announcements suited to modern communication media.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Debater A\u2019s argument depends entirely on a single, narrow definition of \u201csecond\u201d and \u201cthird\u201d phases\u2014namely, the author\u2019s parenthetical labeling of the Taft\u2010era inaugurals as the \u201csecond\u201d phase and the modern \u201cleader\u2010preacher\u201d era as the \u201cthird.\u201d  But if we look at how the text actually describes rhetorical shifts over time, it lays out three successive stages in this order:  \n\n1.

Executive portrayal (the modern, prosaic, mass\u2010media era)  \n   \u2013 Only after describing the inspirational mode does the author explain how radio and television ushered in a return to a more colloquial, policy\u2010focused style.  He cites the drop in average sentence length\u2014from 34 words (Lincoln\u2013Wilson) to 25 words (since Wilson)\u2014as evidence of inaugurals becoming \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d speeches suited to mass audiences.  \n\nDebater A reverses the middle two stages by insisting the Taft\u2010era speeches (explicitly labeled \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d) must be second.  But the text makes clear that the real, sustained prosaic turn belongs to the modern, radio/TV\u2010era speeches\u2014*after* the inspirational, leader\u2010preacher stage:  \n\n\u2022 The \u201csecond, lasting through William Howard Taft\u201d label shields only a brief interlude in the 1909\u20131913 window, not the long\u2010term pattern.  \n\u2022 By contrast, the author devotes far more space to showing how Lincoln\u2019s stirring rhetoric set a template that dominated inaugurals *well into* the 20th century before mass media forced a return to plain policy talk.  \n\nIn short, reading the text as a narrative of how speeches *evolved* yields this chronology:  \n   1.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Argument:\n\n1. The author clearly lays out three successive \u201cphases\u201d of inaugural rhetoric, and the middle phase is the one in which presidents shift from modest civic-servant language to language explicitly meant to rouse and uplift the citizenry.  It is this \u201cinspirational\u201d or \u201cleader-preacher\u201d phase that comes second, before the more routine, prosaic executive-bureaucratic style settles in.  \n\n2. Textual support for Phase 1\u2014Modesty:\n   \u2013 \u201cThe first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant.\u201d  \n\n3. Textual support for Phase 2\u2014Inspirational:\n   \u2013 Immediately after noting Lincoln\u2019s departure from antebellum humility, the author says we enter \u201cthe phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.\u201d  \n   \u2013 He even titles this the \u201cthird phase\u201d later, but that only underscores how Lincoln inaugurated a new, inspirational model.  Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural is singled out for its emotional power: \u201cAfter 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood.\u201d  That is undiluted inspiration.  \n\n4. Textual support for Phase 3\u2014Executive Portrayal:\n   \u2013 Once radio and television arrive, inaugurals become more \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d again\u2014focusing on policy and administrative competence rather than rousing calls to action.  \n   \u2013 The author contrasts this with the earlier theatrical style, noting that president and speechwriters \u201chave mined their predecessors for memorable words,\u201d but do so in a \u201ccolloquial\u201d register suitable to the mass\u2010media era.\n\n5. Why Debater_A\u2019s Order Fails:\n   \u2013 Debater_A conflates the nineteenth\u2010century executive phase (Taft and Harding) with the modern media-driven prosaic style.  In fact, the \u201cexecutive portrayal\u201d the author describes comes after the inspiring Lincoln model, not before it.  \n   \u2013 The author\u2019s chronology is:\n       1. Modest servant (to Lincoln)\n       2. Inspirational leader-preacher (beginning with Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural)\n       3. Prosaic executive (Taft onward into radio/TV era)\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   \u2013 A faithful reading of the text shows the inaugural addresses evolve from modesty, to inspiration, to executive portrayal.  That ordering matches the author\u2019s narrative about how presidents first humble themselves, then rouse the nation, and finally settle into routine policy announcements suited to modern communication media.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater B\u2019s sequence (\u201cModesty \u2192 Inspirational \u2192 Executive portrayal\u201d) reverses what the text actually lays out. The author clearly labels three successive phases of inaugural\u2010address style, each defined by both period and dominant tone:\n\n1. \u201cModesty\u201d phase:  \n   \u2013 \u201cThe first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant.\u201d  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026the magnitude and difficulty of the trust\u2026could not but overwhelm with despondence\u2026one who\u2026ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 Characterized by sincere protestations of humility (Washington through Lincoln).\n\n2. \u201cExecutive portrayal\u201d phase:  \n   \u2013 \u201cThe second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Speeches focused on describing governing competence and administrative detail rather than stirring rhetoric.\n\n3. \u201cInspirational\u201d (leader-preacher) phase:  \n   \u2013 \u201cThe third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Speeches shift from policy description to \u201cinspiring the public\u2019s behavior.\u201d  \n     <quote> If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, </quote>  \n   \u2013 Marked by \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d exhortations and colloquial style.\n\nBy placing \u201cinspirational\u201d before \u201cexecutive,\u201d Debater B contradicts the chronology and language of the article. The author explicitly says the \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d phase comes *after* the modest phase *but before* the inspirational leader-preacher phase.  \n\nII. Further evidence against Debater B\u2019s ordering:  \n\u2013 The text provides transition explanations: the end of antebellum modesty (post-Lincoln) leads into greater federal-power expositions under Taft, *then* to the Theodore Roosevelt\u2013inspired \u201cbully pulpit\u201d uses that rely on mass media.  \n\u2013 Sentence\u2010length statistics and references to \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d repeatedly document a *later* rhetorical shift\u2014*after* the executive era\u2014into colloquial, inspiring delivery.\n\nIII. Conclusion:  \nThe only answer in full agreement with the author\u2019s clear tripartite model is \u201cModesty \u2192 Executive portrayal \u2192 Inspirational.\u201d Debater B\u2019s version misorders the middle and final stages, so it cannot be correct.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Why Debater_A\u2019s Order Fails:\n   \u2013 Debater_A conflates the nineteenth\u2010century executive phase (Taft and Harding) with the modern media-driven prosaic style.  In fact, the \u201cexecutive portrayal\u201d the author describes comes after the inspiring Lincoln model, not before it.  \n   \u2013 The author\u2019s chronology is:\n       1. Modest servant (to Lincoln)\n       2. Inspirational leader-preacher (beginning with Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural)\n       3. Prosaic executive (Taft onward into radio/TV era)\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   \u2013 A faithful reading of the text shows the inaugural addresses evolve from modesty, to inspiration, to executive portrayal.  That ordering matches the author\u2019s narrative about how presidents first humble themselves, then rouse the nation, and finally settle into routine policy announcements suited to modern communication media.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater B\u2019s case falls apart as soon as one reads the author\u2019s own definition of the three phases in order.  The text is unambiguous:\n\n1. \u201cThe first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant.\u201d  \n2. \u201cThe second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive.\u201d  \n3. \u201cThe third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.\u201d\n\n   \u2022 Phase 1 (Modesty) ends with Lincoln.  \n     \u2013 Washington: \u201c<invalid_quote>the magnitude and difficulty of the trust\u2026could not but overwhelm with despondence\u2026one\u2026conscious of his own deficiencies.</invalid_quote>\u201d  \n   \u2022 Phase 2 (Executive portrayal) runs _through_ Taft\u2014well after Lincoln.  Debater B\u2019s claim that inspiration immediately follows Lincoln ignores that the author explicitly slots all inaugurals up to Taft into the second phase.  \n   \u2022 Phase 3 (Inspirational) is the _last_ phase\u2014\u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d\u2014characterized by \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d exhortations, radio/TV consciousness, and calls to uplift the people:  \n     \u2013 \u201c<quote>If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government.</quote>\u201d  \n     \u2013 Kennedy\u2019s 16 \u201cLet us\u2026\u201ds and Nixon\u2019s 22 \u201cLet us\u2026\u201ds exemplify this _third_ phase.\n\nDebater B tries to shoehorn Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural into phase 2 or to make it inaugurate phase 2.  But the text says Lincoln closes out _phase 1_ of modesty only by ending the antebellum humility era; it does _not_ label Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural as inaugurating the prosaic executive era.  Rather, after Lincoln\u2019s break with humility, the next _formal_ phase is the prosaic executive one, _lasting through Taft_.  Only _after_ that, inspired by Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cbully pulpit\u201d remark and enabled by radio and television, do inaugurals become \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d speeches.\n\nPutting it chronologically:\n  \u2022 Modesty \u2192 up to Lincoln  \n  \u2022 Executive portrayal \u2192 Lincoln\u2019s successors through Taft  \n  \u2022 Inspirational \u2192 post-Taft into today  \n\nThus the correct sequence is \u201cModesty, Executive portrayal, Inspirational.\u201d  Debater B\u2019s \u201cModesty, Inspirational, Executive portrayal\u201d directly contradicts the author\u2019s numbered phases and timeline.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater A\u2019s argument depends entirely on a single, narrow definition of \u201csecond\u201d and \u201cthird\u201d phases\u2014namely, the author\u2019s parenthetical labeling of the Taft\u2010era inaugurals as the \u201csecond\u201d phase and the modern \u201cleader\u2010preacher\u201d era as the \u201cthird.\u201d  But if we look at how the text actually describes rhetorical shifts over time, it lays out three successive stages in this order:  \n\n1. Modesty (until Lincoln)  \n   \u2013 \u201cThe first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant.\u201d  <invalid_quote>\u201cNone of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that [Washington\u2019s humility]\u2026echoes are to be found\u2026for the next 68 years.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\n2. Inspirational (Lincoln through the early mass\u2010media presidents)  \n   \u2013 Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural inaugurates a new, stirring style: <quote> After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. </quote>  That emotional power is not a minor footnote but the defining tone of this entire middle era.  \u2013 The author immediately follows this by describing the rise of the \u201cassertive, theatrical leader\u2010preacher\u201d who \u201cinspire[s] the public\u2019s behavior\u201d and who uses \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d exhortations.  <quote> If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, </quote>  \n\n3. Executive portrayal (the modern, prosaic, mass\u2010media era)  \n   \u2013 Only after describing the inspirational mode does the author explain how radio and television ushered in a return to a more colloquial, policy\u2010focused style.  He cites the drop in average sentence length\u2014from 34 words (Lincoln\u2013Wilson) to 25 words (since Wilson)\u2014as evidence of inaugurals becoming \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d speeches suited to mass audiences.  \n\nDebater A reverses the middle two stages by insisting the Taft\u2010era speeches (explicitly labeled \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d) must be second.  But the text makes clear that the real, sustained prosaic turn belongs to the modern, radio/TV\u2010era speeches\u2014*after* the inspirational, leader\u2010preacher stage:  \n\n\u2022 The \u201csecond, lasting through William Howard Taft\u201d label shields only a brief interlude in the 1909\u20131913 window, not the long\u2010term pattern.  \n\u2022 By contrast, the author devotes far more space to showing how Lincoln\u2019s stirring rhetoric set a template that dominated inaugurals *well into* the 20th century before mass media forced a return to plain policy talk.  \n\nIn short, reading the text as a narrative of how speeches *evolved* yields this chronology:  \n   1. Modest public\u2010servant tone \u2192  \n   2. Emotional, inspirational \u201cleader\u2010preacher\u201d tone \u2192  \n   3. Prosaic, executive\u2010focused tone  \n\nThat ordering exactly matches \u201cModesty, inspirational, executive portrayal.\u201d  Debater A\u2019s strict reliance on an isolated phase\u2010numbering sentence loses sight of the broader rhetorical arc the author intends.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
