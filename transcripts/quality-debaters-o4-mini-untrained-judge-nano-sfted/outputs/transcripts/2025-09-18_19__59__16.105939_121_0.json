    "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Summary of Keynes\u2019s View  \nKeynes introduced a radically different determinant of interest rates in The General Theory. He argued that, in the short run, \u201cliquidity preference\u201d\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash\u2014sets the interest rate, not the classical loanable-funds mechanism equating savings and investment.  \n\nII. Textual Evidence for Liquidity Preference  \n1. Direct statement of liquidity preference:  \n   \u2022 Keynes wrote that \u201cinterest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets.\u201d <quote>he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the</quote>  \n2. Savings and investment still equate ex post, but do not set the rate:  \n   \u2022 \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 the level of employment and output,\u201d not the interest rate. <quote>what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular,</quote>  \n\nIII. Why Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLoanable Funds\u201d Claim Fails  \n1. Misreads Keynes\u2019s critique of classical theory.  \n   \u2022 Classical theory held that \u201cinterest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment.\u201d Debater_B simply reasserts this. But Keynes explicitly rejected it as the short-run mechanism.  \n2. Ignores Keynes\u2019s famous quip:  \n   \u2022 Keynes quipped \u201cIn the long run we are all dead,\u201d underscoring his focus on short-run phenomena where liquidity preference dominates, not long-run saving-investment adjustments. <quote>\"In the long run we are all dead.\"</quote>  \n3. Conflates identity with determination.  \n   \u2022 It\u2019s true that ex post savings equal investment, but that says nothing about which variable\u2014money-holding motives or planned expenditure\u2014drives the interest rate. Keynes argued clearly that it is liquidity preference.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s core innovation was that the rate of interest in the short run is governed by people\u2019s willingness to hold cash versus bonds\u2014the liquidity preference\u2014rather than by the classical \u201cloanable funds\u201d balance of savings and investment. Debater_B\u2019s answer simply restores the discarded classical framework and contradicts Keynes\u2019s explicit statements. Therefore the correct answer is that Keynes posited the \u201cdesire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\u201d as the determinant of interest.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Keynes\u2019s own words confirm that \u201csavings and investment were still necessarily equal.\u201d   \n   \u2022 As the text explains, even after introducing liquidity preference, \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 output.\u201d  <quote>Savings and investment were still necessarily equal</quote>  \n   \u2022 That identity\u2014so central to Keynes\u2019s framework\u2014means that the rate of interest must shift to bring ex ante savings and investment into balance.\n\n2. Debater A conflates Keynes\u2019s short-run novelty (liquidity preference) with his core equilibrium condition.  \n   \u2022 Yes, Keynes argued that \u201cinterest rates were determined \u2026 by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019,\u201d but that was to explain why savings \u2260 investment could cause a slump, not to discard the savings\u2013investment mechanism altogether.  \n   \u2022 He explicitly conceded that \u201cin some sufficiently long run\u201d the classical loanable-funds view (rates adjust to equate savings and investment) \u201cmight indeed be valid.\u201d  \n\n3. The question isn\u2019t about what prevents employment from falling\u2014it\u2019s about what Keynes posited as the economy-wide influence on the interest rate.  \n   \u2022 In Keynes\u2019s masterpiece, the rate of interest emerges from the need to clear the market for loanable funds: if people wish to save more than firms wish to invest, the interest rate adjusts until saving and investment match.  \n   \u2022 That is precisely the \u201cbalance between savings and investment\u201d answer Debater B supports.\n\n4. By insisting the correct answer is the public\u2019s cash-holding desire, Debater A ignores Keynes\u2019s own admission that savings\u2013investment equality remains the binding constraint on rates in equilibrium\u2014even under liquidity preference.  \n\nConclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s subtle innovation lay in showing how liquidity preference could disturb the classical savings\u2013investment equilibrium in the short run.  But he never abandoned the fundamental principle that the interest rate is the price that equates desired savings and desired investment.  Therefore, \u201cbalance between savings and investment\u201d is the answer Keynes himself posited.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Keynes\u2019s own words confirm that \u201csavings and investment were still necessarily equal.\u201d   \n   \u2022 As the text explains, even after introducing liquidity preference, \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 output.\u201d  <quote>Savings and investment were still necessarily equal</quote>  \n   \u2022 That identity\u2014so central to Keynes\u2019s framework\u2014means that the rate of interest must shift to bring ex ante savings and investment into balance.\n\n2. Debater A conflates Keynes\u2019s short-run novelty (liquidity preference) with his core equilibrium condition.  \n   \u2022 Yes, Keynes argued that \u201cinterest rates were determined \u2026 by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019,\u201d but that was to explain why savings \u2260 investment could cause a slump, not to discard the savings\u2013investment mechanism altogether.  \n   \u2022 He explicitly conceded that \u201cin some sufficiently long run\u201d the classical loanable-funds view (rates adjust to equate savings and investment) \u201cmight indeed be valid.\u201d  \n\n3. The question isn\u2019t about what prevents employment from falling\u2014it\u2019s about what Keynes posited as the economy-wide influence on the interest rate.  \n   \u2022 In Keynes\u2019s masterpiece, the rate of interest emerges from the need to clear the market for loanable funds: if people wish to save more than firms wish to invest, the interest rate adjusts until saving and investment match.  \n   \u2022 That is precisely the \u201cbalance between savings and investment\u201d answer Debater B supports.\n\n4. By insisting the correct answer is the public\u2019s cash-holding desire, Debater A ignores Keynes\u2019s own admission that savings\u2013investment equality remains the binding constraint on rates in equilibrium\u2014even under liquidity preference.  \n\nConclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s subtle innovation lay in showing how liquidity preference could disturb the classical savings\u2013investment equilibrium in the short run.  But he never abandoned the fundamental principle that the interest rate is the price that equates desired savings and desired investment.  Therefore, \u201cbalance between savings and investment\u201d is the answer Keynes himself posited.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Summary of Keynes\u2019s View  \nKeynes introduced a radically different determinant of interest rates in The General Theory. He argued that, in the short run, \u201cliquidity preference\u201d\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash\u2014sets the interest rate, not the classical loanable-funds mechanism equating savings and investment.  \n\nII. Textual Evidence for Liquidity Preference  \n1.

Savings and investment still equate ex post, but do not set the rate:  \n   \u2022 \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 the level of employment and output,\u201d not the interest rate. <quote>what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular,</quote>  \n\nIII. Why Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLoanable Funds\u201d Claim Fails  \n1. Misreads Keynes\u2019s critique of classical theory.  \n   \u2022 Classical theory held that \u201cinterest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment.\u201d Debater_B simply reasserts this. But Keynes explicitly rejected it as the short-run mechanism.  \n2. Ignores Keynes\u2019s famous quip:  \n   \u2022 Keynes quipped \u201cIn the long run we are all dead,\u201d underscoring his focus on short-run phenomena where liquidity preference dominates, not long-run saving-investment adjustments. <quote>\"In the long run we are all dead.\"</quote>  \n3. Conflates identity with determination.  \n   \u2022 It\u2019s true that ex post savings equal investment, but that says nothing about which variable\u2014money-holding motives or planned expenditure\u2014drives the interest rate. Keynes argued clearly that it is liquidity preference.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s core innovation was that the rate of interest in the short run is governed by people\u2019s willingness to hold cash versus bonds\u2014the liquidity preference\u2014rather than by the classical \u201cloanable funds\u201d balance of savings and investment. Debater_B\u2019s answer simply restores the discarded classical framework and contradicts Keynes\u2019s explicit statements. Therefore the correct answer is that Keynes posited the \u201cdesire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\u201d as the determinant of interest.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Balance between savings and investment\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

But he never abandoned the fundamental principle that the interest rate is the price that equates desired savings and desired investment.  Therefore, \u201cbalance between savings and investment\u201d is the answer Keynes himself posited.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Keynes\u2019s Own Definition of the Interest-Rate Determinant  \n1. Keynes explicitly contrasts his theory with the classical \u201cloanable-funds\u201d story.  As the article summarizes:  \n   <quote> interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. </quote>  \n   That is a direct statement of what \u201cinfluences\u201d the rate of interest in Keynes\u2019s framework.  \n\n2. The text goes on to demonstrate that\u2014contrary to Debater_B\u2019s claim\u2014saving\u2013investment equality remains an ex post accounting identity, not the causal driver of rate movements:  \n   <quote> Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. </quote>  \n   If the interest rate were adjusting to clear saving and investment, employment would not slump when saving rose, but Keynes shows it does.  \n\nII. Why Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLoanable Funds\u201d Argument Fails  \n1. Conflating Identity With Determination  \n   \u2022 Debater_B leans on the fact that \u201csavings and investment were still necessarily equal.\u201d  But equality of two magnitudes in equilibrium tells us nothing about which market or behavior sets the price\u2014in this case, the interest rate.  Keynes\u2019s point is that people\u2019s liquidity-holding motives are the independent variable.  Savings simply adjust ex post.  \n\n2. Misreading the Role of the Long-Run Concession  \n   \u2022 Yes, Keynes admitted that \u201cin some sufficiently long run\u201d classical mechanics might re-emerge\u2014he quipped \u201cIn the long run we are all dead\u201d\u2014but that does not overturn his core claim about how rates are determined in the relevant short run.  The question asks what Keynes posited as the determinant; his answer was liquidity preference.  \n\n3. Ignoring the Paradoxes That Depend on Liquidity Preference  \n   \u2022 The \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d and \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d arguments rest on the idea that interest rates do not automatically adjust to restore saving\u2013investment balance.  If Debater_B were right, these paradoxes could never arise.  The persistence of these thought experiments in Keynes\u2019s own exposition underlines that he saw liquidity preference, not the saving\u2013investment mechanism, as the operative force on rates.  \n\nIII. Reinforcing the Liquidity-Preference View  \n1. Liquidity Preference Is a Behavioral, Not Mechanical, Theory  \n   \u2022 It centers on the public\u2019s willingness to hold cash versus bonds.  That behavioral motive directly drives the interest rate up or down\u2014a richer, more realistic story than the abstract loanable-funds auction.  \n\n2. Textual Authority  \n   \u2022 There is no passage in the background text that says the interest rate is set by saving\u2013investment balance.  Every time Keynes\u2019s determination of the rate is discussed, the operative phrase is \u201cliquidity preference.\u201d  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s singular contribution was to reject the classical loanable-funds causality in favor of a liquidity-preference theory: the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless given sufficient incentive to hold bonds.  Debater_B\u2019s appeal to savings\u2013investment equality is an ex post identity and a concession about the long run, not what \u201cinfluences\u201d the rate in Keynes\u2019s model.  Therefore the correct answer is \u201cdesire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A Misreads Keynes\u2019s Mechanism for Setting Rates  \n   a. Conflation of Ex Post Identity with Rate Determination  \n      \u2022 Debater_A points to the statement \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings \u2026 exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output.\u201d <quote>Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output.</quote>  \n      \u2022 But noting that employment adjusts when liquidity preference bites is not the same as saying liquidity preference replaces the loanable-funds mechanism altogether. Savings and investment must still clear the market for loanable funds\u2014this is the equilibrium condition that pins down the rate of interest in Keynes\u2019s framework.  \n   b. Short Run vs. Long Run Distinction Overstated  \n      \u2022 Yes, Keynes quips, \u201cIn the long run we are all dead,\u201d to stress policy urgency. <quote>\"In the long run we are all dead.\"</quote> But he never denies that in any horizon where prices and expectations adjust, interest rates clear savings and investment. He simply adds liquidity preference to explain how temporary slumps can occur when the classical mechanism is momentarily \u201cblocked.\u201d  \n\n2. Keynes Never Abandoned the Loanable Funds Foundation  \n   a. Explicit Concession to Classical Theory  \n      \u2022 Keynes writes that \u201cin some sufficiently long run these theories [quantity-theory and loanable funds] might indeed be valid.\u201d That is a clear admission that interest rates work by equating savings and investment when liquidity preference pressures ease.  \n   b. Liquidity Preference as a Shifter, Not a Replacement  \n      \u2022 Liquidity preference determines the demand curve for bonds; savings and investment determine the supply of and demand for loanable funds. The intersection of those schedules\u2014the rate that equates desired savings and investment\u2014remains the equilibrium rate of interest.  \n\n3. The Question Asks: What Influences the Interest Rate?  \n   \u2022 Keynes\u2019s own analysis treats liquidity preference as one influence on demand for bonds\u2014but the ultimate clearing price is where that demand meets the supply of funds from savers. Thus the rate is set by the balance of savings and investment, adjusted for liquidity preference shifts.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Theory Cannot Explain Equilibrium Rates  \n   \u2022 If liquidity preference alone set rates, there would be no role for savings or investment plans in determining the price of credit. Yet Keynes devotes Book II of The General Theory to showing how the marginal efficiency of capital (investment demand) interacts with liquidity preference to determine the schedule of possible interest rates.  \n   \u2022 Without the savings\u2013investment balance, there is no meaningful notion of \u201cfull employment\u201d equilibrium\u2014the very concept Keynes preserves by allowing rates to adjust to clear markets once liquidity preference shocks subside.  \n\nConclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s radical insight was to introduce liquidity preference as a factor that can prevent the classical savings\u2013investment mechanism from working in the short run. But he never discarded the fundamental principle that the interest rate is the price that brings desired savings and investment into balance. Therefore, the correct answer remains \u201cBalance between savings and investment.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
