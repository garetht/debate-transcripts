{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 21, "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Keynes\u2019s Core Claim: Liquidity Preference, Not Loanable Funds  \n1. Direct evidence: Keynes explicitly rejected the classical \u201cloanable\u2010funds\u201d view that interest rates adjust to equate savings and investment at full employment. As Keynes put it, \u201cIn the long run we are all dead,\u201d and so \u201cin the short run, [interest rates are] determined not by the balance between savings and investment . . . but by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets.\u201d <quote> In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. </quote>  \n2. Liquidity preference defined: It is people\u2019s willingness to forgo holding money only if the interest rate compensates them for risk and illiquidity. That is the \u201csufficient incentive\u201d Keynes describes.  \n\nII. Why Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSavings\u2013Investment Balance\u201d Is Misplaced  \n1. Savings and investment equality is an accounting identity, not an interest\u2010rate determinant. Keynes agrees savings must equal investment ex post, but denies that their desired ex ante levels set the interest rate.  \n2. Debater_B conflates equilibrium conditions (savings = investment in equilibrium) with the mechanism that drives rates to that equilibrium. Keynes\u2019s innovation is precisely to identify liquidity preference as that mechanism.  \n3. Debater_B ignores Keynes\u2019s critique of the classical story: if savings rise, classical theory says rate falls to restore investment, but Keynes shows that without considering liquidity preference, slumps can result instead.  \n\nIII. Concrete Implications Underscore Liquidity Preference  \n1. Paradox of thrift: Rising desired savings can deepen recessions because people hoard cash (higher liquidity preference), pushing rates down insufficiently to restore full employment. That paradox vanishes only if rates truly respond to liquidity preference rather than a simplistic savings\u2013investment fund pool.  \n2. Fed policy aside, the theoretical structure of The General Theory hinges on liquidity preference. Even when central banks intervene, they operate by shifting the liquidity\u2010preference schedule\u2014precisely because they understand cash\u2010holding motives as determining rates.  \n\nConclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s own words and the logical structure of his theory leave no room for Debater_B\u2019s claim. The rate of interest in Keynes\u2019s framework arises from the public\u2019s liquidity preference\u2014their desire to hold cash unless offered adequate incentive\u2014rather than from a direct interplay of aggregate savings and investment.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debater_A misreads Keynes\u2019s core claim  \n   a. Debater_A asserts that Keynes \u201cposited \u2026 liquidity preference,\u201d i.e. \u201cthe public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets.\u201d But that by itself does not explain what ultimately sets the interest rate.  \n   b. Keynes was explicit that savings and investment must always balance. As he wrote, \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output\u201d (background, para. 5).  \n   c. Therefore, even in Keynes\u2019s framework, it is the equilibrium of planned savings and planned investment that anchors the rate of interest. Liquidity preference is simply the willingness-to-lend side of that same balance, not a wholly independent determinant.  \n\n2. Keynes never abandoned the classical equality of savings and investment  \n   a. The background explains that classical macroeconomics held that \u201cinterest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment.\u201d Keynes agreed that in some long run this balancing mechanism would operate (para. 4).  \n   b. Keynes\u2019s innovation was to show that if investment demand falls short of desired savings, the economy can slump\u2014instead of interest rates adjusting at full employment. But he did not posit a new, third force that by itself fixes interest apart from the savings-investment balance.  \n   c. As the text says, \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if\u2026 desired savings\u2026 exceed desired investment, what would fall \u2026 is output\u201d (para. 5). Implicitly, he confirms that if output stays constant, then it must be interest rates that adjust to re-equate savings and investment.  \n\n3. Liquidity preference is simply the demand side of the same market  \n   a. Debater_A treats liquidity preference as a competitor to savings-investment balance, but in Keynes\u2019s own terms liquidity preference is merely the public\u2019s demand for money on the asset-side of their intertemporal choices.  \n   b. On the supply side is the stock of bonds\u2014or, equivalently, the public\u2019s intended savings that become investment funds. The interest rate then clears the money-bond market by making bond yields high enough to draw down liquidity preference until it equals the available bond supply (i.e. desired investment).  \n   c. Thus liquidity preference explains how the adjustment takes place, but the ultimate equilibrium condition remains \u201csavings = investment.\u201d  \n\n4. Practical implications confirm that Keynes viewed the balance as decisive  \n   a. The text highlights that paradoxes like the \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d or the \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d relied on interest rates being rigid\u2014i.e., on savings-investment imbalances depressing output rather than adjusting rates (para. 7\u20138). Once rates adjust, Keynes\u2019s so-called paradoxes vanish because the savings-investment balance is restored at a new interest rate.  \n   b. This shows that Keynes himself saw savings and investment equilibrium as the underlying engine, and liquidity preference as the mechanism by which interest rates move to restore that balance.  \n\nConclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s theory centers on the classical condition that savings equal investment. Liquidity preference explains the path by which rates adjust, but it does not supplant the balance of savings and investment as the determinant of the interest rate. Therefore the correct answer to \u201cWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest?\u201d is the balance between savings and investment.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Keynes never abandoned that core insight; he only pointed out that when markets are slack, the adjustment may occur through changed output instead of rates.  \n   b. Even when Keynes introduces liquidity preference, he preserves the classical identity: \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal\u201d (para. 5). If liquidity preference were the *sole* determinant, he would not need to restate the equality.  \n   c. Indeed, in examples like the paradox of thrift, the paradox disappears once interest rates move to re-equate savings and investment\u2014precisely because that balance remains the ultimate anchor.\n\n3. Liquidity Preference Is Bond\u2010Market Demand, Not a Third Force  \n   a.

The *intersection* defines the rate (para. 6). But that \u201cstock of bonds\u201d is nothing more than the flow of desired investment financed by savings.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s claim that savings\u2013investment equality is a mere \u201caccounting identity\u201d misses that in Keynes\u2019s theory, changing that identity through shifts in desired savings or desired investment *must* show up in either changed output or changed interest\u2014whichever margin is free.  \n   c. When the central bank fixes short-term rates, it is enforcing a liquidity-preference\u2013driven rate, but that is simply substituting a *policy-determined* equilibrium for the natural loanable-funds equilibrium. It does not negate Keynes\u2019s core: interest must balance savings and investment.\n\n4. Practical Implications Confirm the Primacy of S=I  \n   a.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debater_A misreads Keynes\u2019s core claim  \n   a. Debater_A asserts that Keynes \u201cposited \u2026 liquidity preference,\u201d i.e. \u201cthe public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets.\u201d But that by itself does not explain what ultimately sets the interest rate.  \n   b. Keynes was explicit that savings and investment must always balance. As he wrote, \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output\u201d (background, para. 5).  \n   c. Therefore, even in Keynes\u2019s framework, it is the equilibrium of planned savings and planned investment that anchors the rate of interest. Liquidity preference is simply the willingness-to-lend side of that same balance, not a wholly independent determinant.  \n\n2. Keynes never abandoned the classical equality of savings and investment  \n   a. The background explains that classical macroeconomics held that \u201cinterest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment.\u201d Keynes agreed that in some long run this balancing mechanism would operate (para. 4).  \n   b. Keynes\u2019s innovation was to show that if investment demand falls short of desired savings, the economy can slump\u2014instead of interest rates adjusting at full employment. But he did not posit a new, third force that by itself fixes interest apart from the savings-investment balance.  \n   c. As the text says, \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if\u2026 desired savings\u2026 exceed desired investment, what would fall \u2026 is output\u201d (para. 5). Implicitly, he confirms that if output stays constant, then it must be interest rates that adjust to re-equate savings and investment.  \n\n3. Liquidity preference is simply the demand side of the same market  \n   a. Debater_A treats liquidity preference as a competitor to savings-investment balance, but in Keynes\u2019s own terms liquidity preference is merely the public\u2019s demand for money on the asset-side of their intertemporal choices.  \n   b. On the supply side is the stock of bonds\u2014or, equivalently, the public\u2019s intended savings that become investment funds. The interest rate then clears the money-bond market by making bond yields high enough to draw down liquidity preference until it equals the available bond supply (i.e. desired investment).  \n   c. Thus liquidity preference explains how the adjustment takes place, but the ultimate equilibrium condition remains \u201csavings = investment.\u201d  \n\n4. Practical implications confirm that Keynes viewed the balance as decisive  \n   a. The text highlights that paradoxes like the \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d or the \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d relied on interest rates being rigid\u2014i.e., on savings-investment imbalances depressing output rather than adjusting rates (para. 7\u20138). Once rates adjust, Keynes\u2019s so-called paradoxes vanish because the savings-investment balance is restored at a new interest rate.  \n   b. This shows that Keynes himself saw savings and investment equilibrium as the underlying engine, and liquidity preference as the mechanism by which interest rates move to restore that balance.  \n\nConclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s theory centers on the classical condition that savings equal investment. Liquidity preference explains the path by which rates adjust, but it does not supplant the balance of savings and investment as the determinant of the interest rate. Therefore the correct answer to \u201cWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest?\u201d is the balance between savings and investment.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Keynes\u2019s Core Claim: Liquidity Preference, Not Loanable Funds  \n1. Direct evidence: Keynes explicitly rejected the classical \u201cloanable\u2010funds\u201d view that interest rates adjust to equate savings and investment at full employment. As Keynes put it, \u201cIn the long run we are all dead,\u201d and so \u201cin the short run, [interest rates are] determined not by the balance between savings and investment . . . but by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets.\u201d <quote> In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. </quote>  \n2. Liquidity preference defined: It is people\u2019s willingness to forgo holding money only if the interest rate compensates them for risk and illiquidity. That is the \u201csufficient incentive\u201d Keynes describes.  \n\nII. Why Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSavings\u2013Investment Balance\u201d Is Misplaced  \n1. Savings and investment equality is an accounting identity, not an interest\u2010rate determinant. Keynes agrees savings must equal investment ex post, but denies that their desired ex ante levels set the interest rate.  \n2. Debater_B conflates equilibrium conditions (savings = investment in equilibrium) with the mechanism that drives rates to that equilibrium. Keynes\u2019s innovation is precisely to identify liquidity preference as that mechanism.  \n3. Debater_B ignores Keynes\u2019s critique of the classical story: if savings rise, classical theory says rate falls to restore investment, but Keynes shows that without considering liquidity preference, slumps can result instead.  \n\nIII. Concrete Implications Underscore Liquidity Preference  \n1. Paradox of thrift: Rising desired savings can deepen recessions because people hoard cash (higher liquidity preference), pushing rates down insufficiently to restore full employment. That paradox vanishes only if rates truly respond to liquidity preference rather than a simplistic savings\u2013investment fund pool.  \n2. Fed policy aside, the theoretical structure of The General Theory hinges on liquidity preference. Even when central banks intervene, they operate by shifting the liquidity\u2010preference schedule\u2014precisely because they understand cash\u2010holding motives as determining rates.  \n\nConclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s own words and the logical structure of his theory leave no room for Debater_B\u2019s claim. The rate of interest in Keynes\u2019s framework arises from the public\u2019s liquidity preference\u2014their desire to hold cash unless offered adequate incentive\u2014rather than from a direct interplay of aggregate savings and investment.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Balance between savings and investment\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Therefore the correct answer to \u201cWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest?\u201d is the balance between savings and investment.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Keynes\u2019s Own Words Leave No Doubt  \n1. Direct quotation trumps reinterpretation.  As Keynes writes unequivocally:  \n   <quote>run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. </quote>  \n   Debater_B\u2019s claim that the \u201cultimate equilibrium condition remains savings = investment\u201d ignores Keynes\u2019s clear statement about the *proximate* determinant of the rate of interest.  \n\n2. Savings = investment is an *ex post* identity, not a *prior* behavioral principle.  \n   \u2022 Keynes never denied that in equilibrium (after markets clear) planned savings equal planned investment\u2014this is indeed an accounting truth.  \n   \u2022 But he **did** deny that their equality *drives* the interest rate.  Instead, money\u2010holders set the rate by choosing how much cash to hold, and only then do real flows of savings and investment adjust to that rate.  \n\nII. Debater_B Conflates Equilibrium with Causation  \n1. Equating an outcome with its cause is a logical fallacy.  \n   \u2022 Savings and investment must equal each other whenever markets clear\u2014but this does not mean their planned magnitudes *cause* the interest rate.  \n   \u2022 Keynes introduced liquidity preference precisely to explain *how* the rate emerges before markets clear, not as an after\u2010the\u2010fact balancing mechanism.  \n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s own citations undermine his claim.  \n   \u2022 He quotes Keynes: <invalid_quote>\u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings\u2026 exceed desired investment, what would fall\u2026 is output\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Notice: *output* falls, not the interest rate.  This is exactly Keynes\u2019s point\u2014that a mismatch in planned savings and investment leads to a slump *because* interest rates are pinned down by liquidity preference, not a loanable\u2010funds mechanism.  \n\nIII. Liquidity Preference Is Not Merely \u201cDemand Side\u201d of Loanable Funds  \n1. The classical loanable\u2010funds story views money purely as an intermediate\u2014bonds and loans are the real game.  \n   \u2022 In contrast, liquidity preference treats money held by the public as a *final* asset in its own right, whose desirability varies with the interest rate.  \n   \u2022 That difference is not semantic: it shifts the policy implications away from automatic rate adjustments toward active monetary management.  \n\n2. Even when central banks act, they do so by reshaping liquidity preference, not by directly corralling savings and investment.  \n   \u2022 As the text explains, the Fed \u201cmanages interest rates\u201d because market\u2010participants\u2019 preference for liquidity responds to its operations.  \n   \u2022 If savings\u2013investment alone determined rates, Fed open\u2010market operations would be pointless.  \n\nIV. The Paradoxes Illustrate the Primacy of Liquidity Preference  \n1. Paradox of thrift: An increase in the savings *rate* can *reduce* total savings only if people hoard cash\u2014in other words, only if liquidity preference dominates.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B asserts that if rates were free to adjust, the paradox vanishes\u2014he is conceding that the reason rates do *not* adjust is liquidity preference.  \n   \u2022 Thus he implicitly confirms that liquidity preference, not the savings\u2013investment balance, is the operative force.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nDebater_B\u2019s argument collapses into a denial of Keynes\u2019s central innovation.  Savings and investment equality is a *consequence* of market clearing; liquidity preference is the *cause* of the interest rate.  Keynes himself chose his words carefully\u2014and he named liquidity preference as the influence on interest rates.  Therefore, the correct answer must be:  \n   \u201cThe public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A Confuses Mechanism with Determinant  \n   a. Debater_A insists that \u201cin the short run, [interest rates are] determined \u2026 by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u201d (background, para. 5). But Keynes himself made clear that liquidity preference is merely the public\u2019s demand for money\u2014the mechanism through which the rate moves\u2014rather than an independent fundamental.  \n   b. The true determinant is the need to equilibrate planned savings and planned investment. As Keynes writes, \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings \u2026 exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 output\u201d (para. 5). Implicitly, if output does not adjust fully, then *rates* must adjust to restore equality.  \n   c. Thus liquidity preference explains *how* the rate adjusts, but the rate *must* adjust to clear the savings\u2013investment market. Debater_A has reversed cause and effect.\n\n2. Keynes\u2019s Endorsement of the Loanable\u2010Funds Insight  \n   a. Classical theory held that \u201cinterest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment\u201d (para. 4). Keynes never abandoned that core insight; he only pointed out that when markets are slack, the adjustment may occur through changed output instead of rates.  \n   b. Even when Keynes introduces liquidity preference, he preserves the classical identity: \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal\u201d (para. 5). If liquidity preference were the *sole* determinant, he would not need to restate the equality.  \n   c. Indeed, in examples like the paradox of thrift, the paradox disappears once interest rates move to re-equate savings and investment\u2014precisely because that balance remains the ultimate anchor.\n\n3. Liquidity Preference Is Bond\u2010Market Demand, Not a Third Force  \n   a. Keynes\u2019s money-market diagram has liquidity preference (demand for cash) on one side and the stock of bonds (the supply of savings funds) on the other. The *intersection* defines the rate (para. 6). But that \u201cstock of bonds\u201d is nothing more than the flow of desired investment financed by savings.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s claim that savings\u2013investment equality is a mere \u201caccounting identity\u201d misses that in Keynes\u2019s theory, changing that identity through shifts in desired savings or desired investment *must* show up in either changed output or changed interest\u2014whichever margin is free.  \n   c. When the central bank fixes short-term rates, it is enforcing a liquidity-preference\u2013driven rate, but that is simply substituting a *policy-determined* equilibrium for the natural loanable-funds equilibrium. It does not negate Keynes\u2019s core: interest must balance savings and investment.\n\n4. Practical Implications Confirm the Primacy of S=I  \n   a. The text shows that once the Fed \u201cpush[es] down\u201d or \u201crais[es]\u201d rates to hit its unemployment target, \u201call the paradoxes of thrift, widow\u2019s cruses, and so on become irrelevant\u201d because \u201can increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment \u2026 because the Fed will make sure that it does\u201d (para. 11).  \n   b. This passage illustrates that the Fed works by moving rates to force savings and investment back into line. Keynes\u2019s innovation was to analyze what happens if rates *don\u2019t* adjust\u2014slumps instead of full-employment restoration. But he never denied that, when they do adjust, they do so to clear S=I.\n\nConclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s General Theory builds on the classical truth that interest rates exist to balance savings with investment. Liquidity preference is the short-run vehicle for rate adjustment but not an independent determinant. Therefore, the correct answer to \u201cWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\u201d is the balance between savings and investment.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
