    "background_text": "Of All Possible Worlds By WILLIAM TENN\n\n\n Illustrated by GAUGHAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction December 1956.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Changing the world is simple; the trick is   to do it before you have a chance to undo it! It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered as he hurried into the  laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,  despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads  deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men  lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.\n\n\n He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the  anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.  This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught  how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great  transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.\n\n\n This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost  outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,  and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also  that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,  being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered again affectionately.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Blight, it would never have been discovered that he and his  seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the ruling powers of Earth, more  than a century later, would never have plucked Max Alben out of an  obscure civil-service job as a relief guard at the North American  Chicken Reservation to his present heroic and remunerative eminence.  He would still be patrolling the barbed wire that surrounded the three  white leghorn hens and two roosters\u2014about one-sixth of the known  livestock wealth of the Western Hemisphere\u2014thoroughly content with  the half-pail of dried apricots he received each and every payday.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Max Alben would  not now be shifting from foot to foot in a physics laboratory,  facing the black market kings of the world and awaiting their final  instructions with an uncertain and submissive grin. Men like O'Hara, who controlled mushrooms, Levney, the blackberry  tycoon, Sorgasso, the packaged-worm monopolist\u2014would black marketeers  of their tremendous stature so much as waste a glance on someone like  Alben ordinarily, let alone confer a lifetime pension on his wife and  five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar a day?\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family on Earth. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n Alben noticed that Abd Sadha had risen from the straight chair at  the far side of the room and was approaching him with a sealed metal  cylinder in one hand.\n\n\n \"We've decided to add a further precaution at the last moment,\" the old  man said. \"That is, the scientists have suggested it and I have\u2014er\u2014I  have given my approval.\"\n\n\n The last remark was added with a slight questioning note as the  Secretary-General of the United Nations looked back rapidly at the  black market princes on the couches behind him. Since they stared back  stonily, but offered no objection, he coughed in relief and returned to  Alben.\n\n\n \"I am sure, young man, that I don't have to go into the details of your  instructions once more. You enter the time machine and go back the  duration for which it has been preset, a hundred and thirteen years, to  the moment after the Guided Missile of 1976 was launched. It is 1976,  isn't it?\" he asked, suddenly uncertain.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" one of the technicians standing by the time machine said  respectfully. \"The experiment with an atomic warhead guided missile  that resulted in the Blight was conducted on this site on April 18,  1976.\" He glanced proudly at the unemotional men on the couches, very  much like a small boy after completing a recitation before visiting  dignitaries from the Board of Education.\n\n\n \"Just so.\" Abd Sadha nodded. \"April 18, 1976. And on this site. You  see, young man, you will materialize at the very moment and on the  very spot where the remote-control station handling the missile  was\u2014er\u2014handling the missile. You will be in a superb position, a  superb position, to deflect the missile in its downward course and  alter human history for the better. Very much for the better. Yes.\"\n\n\n He paused, having evidently stumbled out of his thought sequence.\n\n\n \"And he pulls the red switch toward him,\" Gomez, the dandelion-root  magnate, reminded him sharply, impatiently.\n\n\n \"Ah, yes, the red switch. He pulls the little red switch toward him.  Thank you, Mr. Gomez, thank you very much, sir. He pulls the little  red switch on the green instrument panel toward him, thus preventing  the error that caused the missile to explode in the Brazilian jungle  and causing it, instead, to explode somewhere in the mid-Pacific, as  originally planned.\"\n\n\n The Secretary-General of the United Nations beamed. \"Thus preventing  the Blight, making it nonexistent, as it were, producing a present-day  world in which the Blight never occurred. That is correct, is it not,  gentlemen?\" he asked, turning anxiously again. None of the half-dozen men on couches deigned to answer him. And  Alben kept his eyes deferentially in their direction, too, as he had  throughout this period of last-minute instruction.\n\n\n He knew who ruled his world\u2014these stolid, well-fed men in clean  garments with a minimum of patches, and where patches occurred, at  least they were the color of the surrounding cloth.\n\n\n Sadha might be Secretary-General of the United Nations, but that  was still a civil-service job, only a few social notches higher  than a chicken guard. His clothes were fully as ragged, fully as  multi-colored, as those that Alben had stepped out of. And the gnawing  in his stomach was no doubt almost as great.\n\n\n \"You understand, do you not, young man, that if anything goes wrong,\"  Abd Sadha asked, his head nodding tremulously and anticipating the  answer, \"if anything unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to  continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"\n\n\n \"He understands everything he has to understand,\" Gomez told him.  \"Let's get this thing moving.\"\n\n\n The old man smiled again. \"Yes. Of course, Mr. Gomez.\" He came up to  where Alben stood in the entrance of the time machine and handed the  sealed metal cylinder to him. \"This is the precaution the scientists  have just added. When you arrive at your destination, just before  materializing, you will release it into the surrounding temporal  medium. Our purpose here, as you no doubt\u2014\"\n\n\n Levney sat up on his couch and snapped his fingers peremptorily. \"I  just heard Gomez tell you to get this thing moving, Sadha. And it isn't  moving. We're busy men. We've wasted enough time.\"\n\n\n \"I was just trying to explain a crucial final fact,\" the  Secretary-General apologized. \"A fact which may be highly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've explained enough facts.\" Levney turned to the man inside the  time machine. \"Hey, fella. You. Move! \"\n\n\n Max Alben gulped and nodded violently. He darted to the rear of the  machine and turned the dial which activated it. flick! It was a good job and Mac Albin knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed as he looked at the morose faces  of his two colleagues. Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek had done as much as he  to build the tiny time machine in the secret lab under the helicopter  garage, and they were fully as eager to go, but\u2014unfortunately for  them\u2014they were not descended from the right ancestor.\n\n\n Leisurely, he unzipped the richly embroidered garment that, as the  father of two children, he was privileged to wear, and wriggled into  the housing of the complex little mechanism. This was hardly the  first time he had seen it, since he'd been helping to build the device  from the moment Honek had nodded and risen from the drafting board,  and now he barely wasted a glance on the thumb-size translucent coils  growing out of the almost microscopic energy bubbles which powered them.\n\n\n This machine was the last hope, of 2089, even if the world of 2089, as  a whole, did not know of its existence and would try to prevent its  being put into operation. But it meant a lot more to Mac Albin than  merely saving a world. It meant an adventurous mission with the risk of  death.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed again happily.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Epidemic, it would never have been discovered that he and  his seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the Albins would not have become  physicists upon the passage of the United Nations law that everyone  on Earth\u2014absolutely without exception\u2014had to choose a branch of  research science in which to specialize. In the flabby, careful,  life-guarding world the Earth had become, Mac Albin would never have  been reluctantly selected by his two co-workers as the one to carry the  forbidden banner of dangerous experiment.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Mac Albin would  probably be a biologist today like almost everyone else on Earth,  laboriously working out dreary gene problems instead of embarking on  the greatest adventure Man had known to date.\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, he had at last found a socially useful  escape from genetic responsibility to humanity in general and his own  family in particular. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Mac,\" Skeat said and crossed to the other side of the  narrow laboratory. Albin and Honek watched him stuff several sheets of paper into a small  metal box which he closed without locking.\n\n\n \"You will take care of yourself, won't you, Mac?\" Hugo Honek pleaded.  \"Any time you feel like taking an unnecessary risk, remember that Bob  and I will have to stand trial if you don't come back. We might be  sentenced to complete loss of professional status and spend the rest of  our lives supervising robot factories.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it won't be that bad,\" Albin reassured him absent-mindedly from  where he lay contorted inside the time machine. He watched Skeat coming  toward him with the box.\n\n\n Honek shrugged his shoulders. \"It might be a lot worse than even that  and you know it. The disappearance of a two-time father is going to  leave an awful big vacancy in the world. One-timers, like Bob and  me, are all over the place; if either of us dropped out of sight, it  wouldn't cause nearly as much uproar.\"\n\n\n \"But Bob and you both tried to operate the machine,\" Albin reminded  him. \"And you blacked out after a fifteen-second temporal displacement.  So I'm the only chance, the only way to stop the human race from  dwindling and dwindling till it hits absolute zero, like that fat old  Security Council seems willing for it to do.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Mac,\" Bob Skeat said as he handed the metal box to  Albin. \"The Security Council is just trying to solve the problem in  their way, the conservative way: a worldwide concentration on genetics  research coupled with the maximum preservation of existing human lives,  especially those that have a high reproductive potential. We three  disagree with them; we've been skulking down here nights to solve it our way, and ours is a radical approach and plenty risky. That's  the reason for the metal box\u2014trying to cover one more explosive  possibility.\"\n\n\n Albin turned it around curiously. \"How?\"\n\n\n \"I sat up all last night writing the manuscript that's inside it. Look,  Mac, when you go back to the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976 and  push that red switch away from you, a lot of other things are going to  happen than just deflecting the missile so that it will explode in the  Brazilian jungle instead of the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. I know. If it explodes in the jungle, the Epidemic doesn't  occur. No Shapiro's Mumps.\"\n\n\n Skeat jiggled his pudgy little face impatiently. \"That's not what I  mean. The Epidemic doesn't occur, but something else does. A new world,  a different 2089, an alternate time sequence. It'll be a world in which  humanity has a better chance to survive, but it'll be one with problems  of its own. Maybe tough problems. Maybe the problems will be tough  enough so that they'll get the same idea we did and try to go back to  the same point in time to change them.\" Albin laughed. \"That's just looking for trouble.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it is, but that's my job. Hugo's the designer of the time  machine and you're the operator, but I'm the theoretical man in this  research team. It's my job to look for trouble. So, just in case, I  wrote a brief history of the world from the time the missile exploded  in the Pacific. It tells why ours is the worst possible of futures.  It's in that box.\"\n\n\n \"What do I do with it\u2014hand it to the guy from the alternate 2089?\"\n\n\n The small fat man exasperatedly hit the side of the time machine with  a well-cushioned palm. \"You know better. There won't be any alternate  2089 until you push that red switch on the green instrument panel. The  moment you do, our world, with all its slow slide to extinction, goes  out and its alternate goes on\u2014just like two electric light bulbs on a  push-pull circuit. We and every single one of our artifacts, including  the time machine, disappear. The problem is how to keep that manuscript  from disappearing.\n\n\n \"Well, all you do, if I have this figured right, is shove the metal  box containing the manuscript out into the surrounding temporal medium  a moment before you materialize to do your job. That temporal medium  in which you'll be traveling is something that exists independent of  and autonomous to all possible futures. It's my hunch that something  that's immersed in it will not be altered by a new time sequence.\" \"Remind him to be careful, Bob,\" Honek rumbled. \"He thinks he's Captain  Blood and this is his big chance to run away to sea and become a  swashbuckling pirate.\"\n\n\n Albin grimaced in annoyance. \"I am excited by doing something  besides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions for the first time in my life. But I know that this is a  first experiment. Honestly, Hugo, I really have enough intelligence to  recognize that simple fact. I know that if anything unexpected pops up,  anything we didn't foresee, I'm supposed to come scuttling back and ask  for advice.\"\n\n\n \"I hope you do,\" Bob Skeat sighed. \"I hope you do know that. A  twentieth century poet once wrote something to the effect that the  world will end not with a bang, but a whimper. Well, our world is  ending with a whimper. Try to see that it doesn't end with a bang,  either.\"\n\n\n \"That I'll promise you,\" Albin said a trifle disgustedly. \"It'll end  with neither a bang nor a whimper. So long, Hugo. So long, Bob.\"\n\n\n He twisted around, reaching overhead for the lever which activated the  forces that drove the time machine. flick! It was strange, Max Alben reflected, that this time travel business,  which knocked unconscious everyone who tried it, only made him feel  slightly dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni,  he had been told. There must be some complicated scientific explanation  for it, he decided\u2014and that would make it none of his business. Better  forget about it.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a heavy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of patrolling his beat at the North American Chicken Reservation in a  thick fog.\n\n\n According to his gauges, he was now in 1976. He cut speed until he hit  the last day of April, then cut speed again, drifting slowly backward  to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile Experiment.  Carefully, carefully, like a man handling a strange bomb made on a  strange planet, he watched the center gauge until the needle came to  rest against the thin etched line that indicated the exactly crucial  moment. Then he pulled the brake and stopped the machine dead.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  pull the red switch toward him. Then his well-paid assignment would be  done.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He stopped and scratched his dirt-matted hair. Wasn't there something  he was supposed to do a second before materialization? Yes, that  useless old windbag, Sadha, had given him a last instruction.\n\n\n He picked up the sealed metal cylinder, walked to the entrance of the  time machine and tossed it into the gray murk. A solid object floating  near the entrance caught his eye. He put his arm out\u2014whew, it was  cold!\u2014and pulled it inside.\n\n\n A small metal box. Funny. What was it doing out there? Curiously,  he opened it, hoping to find something valuable. Nothing but a few  sheets of paper, Alben noted disappointedly. He began to read them  slowly, very slowly, for the manuscript was full of a lot of long and  complicated words, like a letter from one bookworm scientist to another.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976,  he read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was  the one of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been  warning about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the  Pacific Ocean as planned, the physicists and the military men went  home to study their notes, and the world shivered once more over the  approaching war and tried to forget about it.\n\n\n But there was fallout, a radioactive rain several hundred miles to  the north, and a small fishing fleet got thoroughly soaked by it.  Fortunately, the radioactivity in the rain was sufficiently low to do  little obvious physical damage: All it did was cause a mutation in the  mumps virus that several of the men in the fleet were incubating at the  time, having caught it from the children of the fishing town, among  whom a minor epidemic was raging. The fleet returned to its home town, which promptly came down with the  new kind of mumps. Dr. Llewellyn Shapiro, the only physician in town,  was the first man to note that, while the symptoms of this disease were  substantially milder than those of its unmutated parent, practically no  one was immune to it and its effects on human reproductivity were truly  terrible. Most people were completely sterilized by it. The rest were  rendered much less capable of fathering or bearing offspring.\n\n\n Shapiro's Mumps spread over the entire planet in the next few decades.  It leaped across every quarantine erected; for a long time, it  successfully defied all the vaccines and serums attempted against  it. Then, when a vaccine was finally perfected, humanity discovered  to its dismay that its generative powers had been permanently and  fundamentally impaired.\n\n\n Something had happened to the germ plasm. A large percentage of  individuals were born sterile, and, of those who were not, one child  was usually the most that could be expected, a two-child parent being  quite rare and a three-child parent almost unknown.\n\n\n Strict eugenic control was instituted by the Security Council of the  United Nations so that fertile men and women would not be wasted upon  non-fertile mates. Fertility was the most important avenue to social  status, and right after it came successful genetic research.\n\n\n Genetic research had the very best minds prodded into it; the lesser  ones went into the other sciences. Everyone on Earth was engaged in  some form of scientific research to some extent. Since the population  was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all  physical labor had long been done by robots. The government saw to it  that everybody had an ample supply of goods and, in return, asked only  that they experiment without any risk to their own lives\u2014every human  being was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\n\n\n There were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger  point, it had been estimated, where a species might be wiped out by a  new calamity. Not that another calamity would be needed. Since the end  of the Epidemic, the birth rate had been moving further and further  behind the death rate. In another century....\n\n\n That was why a desperate and secret attempt to alter the past was being  made. This kind of world was evidently impossible.\n\n\n Max Alben finished the manuscript and sighed. What a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\n\n\n He walked to the rear dials and began the process of materializing at  the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! It was odd, Mac Albin reflected, that these temporal journeys, which  induced coma in everyone who tried it, only made him feel slightly  dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni, he  knew. Maybe there was some genetic relationship with his above-average  fertility\u2014might be a good idea to mention the idea to a biologist or  two when he returned. If he returned.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a soupy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of the problems of landing a helicopter in a thick fog when the robot  butler had not been told to turn on the ground lights.\n\n\n According to the insulated register, he was now in 1976. He lowered  speed until he registered April, then maneuvered slowly backward  through time to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile  Experiment. Carefully, carefully, like an obstetrician supervising  surgical robots at an unusually difficult birth, he watched the  register until it rolled to rest against the notch that indicated the  exactly crucial moment. Then he pushed a button and froze the machine  where it was.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  push the red switch from him. Then his exciting adventure would be over.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He paused and tapped at his sleek chin. He was supposed to do something  a second before materialization. Yes, that nervous theoretician, Bob  Skeat, had given him a last suggestion.\n\n\n He picked up the small metal box, twisted around to face the opening  of the time machine and dropped it into the gray murk. A solid object  floating near the opening attracted his attention. He shot his arm  out\u2014it was cold , as cold as they had figured\u2014and pulled the object  inside.\n\n\n A sealed metal cylinder. Strange. What was it doing out there?  Anxiously, he opened it, not daring to believe he'd find a document  inside. Yes, that was exactly what it was, he saw excitedly. He began  to read it rapidly, very rapidly, as if it were a newly published paper  on neutrinos. Besides, the manuscript was written with almost painful  simplicity, like a textbook composed by a stuffy pedagogue for the use  of morons.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976, he  read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was the one  of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been warning  about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the Brazilian  jungle through some absolutely unforgivable error in the remote-control  station, the officer in charge of the station was reprimanded and the  men under him court-martialed, and the Brazilian government was paid a  handsome compensation for the damage. But there had been more damage than anyone knew at the time. A plant  virus, similar to the tobacco mosaic, had mutated under the impact  of radioactivity. Five years later, it burst out of the jungle and  completely wiped out every last rice plant on Earth. Japan and a large  part of Asia became semi-deserts inhabited by a few struggling nomads.\n\n\n Then the virus adjusted to wheat and corn\u2014and famine howled in every  street of the planet. All attempts by botanists to control the Blight  failed because of the swiftness of its onslaught. And after it had fed,  it hit again at a new plant and another and another.\n\n\n Most of the world's non-human mammals had been slaughtered for food  long before they could starve to death. Many insects, too, before they  became extinct at the loss of their edible plants, served to assuage  hunger to some small extent.\n\n\n But the nutritive potential of Earth was steadily diminishing in a  horrifying geometric progression. Recently, it had been observed,  plankton\u2014the tiny organism on which most of the sea's ecology was  based\u2014had started to disappear, and with its diminution, dead fish had  begun to pile up on the beaches.\n\n\n Mankind had lunged out desperately in all directions in an effort to  survive, but nothing had worked for any length of time. Even the other  planets of the Solar System, which had been reached and explored  at a tremendous cost in remaining resources, had yielded no edible  vegetation. Synthetics had failed to fill the prodigious gap.\n\n\n In the midst of the sharply increasing hunger, social controls had  pretty much dissolved. Pathetic attempts at rationing still continued,  but black markets became the only markets, and black marketeers the  barons of life. Starvation took the hindmost, and only the most agile  economically lived in comparative comfort. Law and order were had only  by those who could afford to pay for them and children of impoverished  families were sold on the open market for a bit of food.\n\n\n But the Blight was still adjusting to new plants and the food supply  kept shrinking. In another century....\n\n\n That was why the planet's powerful individuals had been persuaded to  pool their wealth in a desperate attempt to alter the past. This kind  of world was manifestly impossible.\n\n\n Mac Albin finished the document and sighed. What a magnificent world!  What an exciting place to live!\n\n\n He dropped his hand on the side levers and began the process of  materializing at the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to take on a  blurred reality all around him, Max Alben felt a bit of fear at what  he was doing. The technicians, he remembered, the Secretary-General,  even the black market kings, had all warned him not to go ahead with  his instructions if anything unusual turned up. That was an awful lot  of power to disobey: he knew he should return with this new information  and let better minds work on it.\n\n\n They with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been  like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger, scrabbling, servility, and  more hunger. Every time things got really tight, you and your wife  looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring  the best price. Buying security for them, as he was now, at the risk of  his life.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, there was a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children. A man like himself, with five children\u2014why, he'd be a big man, maybe the biggest man on  Earth! And he'd have robots to work for him and lots of food. Above  all, lots and lots of food.\n\n\n He'd even be a scientist\u2014 everyone was a scientist there, weren't  they?\u2014and he'd have a big laboratory all to himself. This other world  had its troubles, but it was a lot nicer place than where he'd come  from. He wouldn't return. He'd go through with it.\n\n\n The fear left him and, for the first time in his life, Max Alben felt  the sensation of power.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  sweating a bit at the sight of the roomful of military figures, despite  the technicians' reassurances that all this would be happening too fast  to be visible. He saw the single red switch pointing upward on the  instrument panel. The switch that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to oscillate into  reality all around him, Mac Albin felt a bit of shame at what he was  doing. He'd promised Bob and Hugo to drop the experiment at any stage  if a new factor showed up. He knew he should go back with this new  information and have all three of them kick it around.\n\n\n But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful  adjustment to their thoroughly blueprinted lives? They, at least, had  been ordered to marry women they could live with; he'd drawn a female  with whom he was completely incompatible in any but a genetic sense.  Genetics! He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. He was tired of having to undertake a simple  adventure like a thief in the night.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, someone like himself would  be a monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own  rules, taking his own women. So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n\n\n He'd formed a pretty good idea of the kind of men who ruled that other  world, from the document in the sealed metal cylinder. The black  marketeers had not even read it. Why, the fools had obviously been  duped by the technicians into permitting the experiment; they had not  grasped the idea that an alternate time track would mean their own  non-existence.\n\n\n This other world had its troubles, but it was certainly a livelier  place than where he'd come from. It deserved a chance. Yes, that was  how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate was  starving but managing to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\n\n\n Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  disregarding the roomful of military figures since he knew they could  not see him. The single red switch pointed downward on the instrument  panel. That was the gimmick that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! ... pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... toward him. flick! ... from him. flick!

It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered as he hurried into the  laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,  despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads  deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men  lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.\n\n\n He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the  anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.  This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught  how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great  transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.\n\n\n This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost  outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,  and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also  that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,  being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered again affectionately.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Blight, it would never have been discovered that he and his  seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the ruling powers of Earth, more  than a century later, would never have plucked Max Alben out of an  obscure civil-service job as a relief guard at the North American  Chicken Reservation to his present heroic and remunerative eminence.  He would still be patrolling the barbed wire that surrounded the three  white leghorn hens and two roosters\u2014about one-sixth of the known  livestock wealth of the Western Hemisphere\u2014thoroughly content with  the half-pail of dried apricots he received each and every payday.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Max Alben would  not now be shifting from foot to foot in a physics laboratory,  facing the black market kings of the world and awaiting their final  instructions with an uncertain and submissive grin. Men like O'Hara, who controlled mushrooms, Levney, the blackberry  tycoon, Sorgasso, the packaged-worm monopolist\u2014would black marketeers  of their tremendous stature so much as waste a glance on someone like  Alben ordinarily, let alone confer a lifetime pension on his wife and  five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar a day?\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family on Earth. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n Alben noticed that Abd Sadha had risen from the straight chair at  the far side of the room and was approaching him with a sealed metal  cylinder in one hand.\n\n\n \"We've decided to add a further precaution at the last moment,\" the old  man said. \"That is, the scientists have suggested it and I have\u2014er\u2014I  have given my approval.\"\n\n\n The last remark was added with a slight questioning note as the  Secretary-General of the United Nations looked back rapidly at the  black market princes on the couches behind him. Since they stared back  stonily, but offered no objection, he coughed in relief and returned to  Alben.\n\n\n \"I am sure, young man, that I don't have to go into the details of your  instructions once more. You enter the time machine and go back the  duration for which it has been preset, a hundred and thirteen years, to  the moment after the Guided Missile of 1976 was launched. It is 1976,  isn't it?\" he asked, suddenly uncertain.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" one of the technicians standing by the time machine said  respectfully. \"The experiment with an atomic warhead guided missile  that resulted in the Blight was conducted on this site on April 18,  1976.\" He glanced proudly at the unemotional men on the couches, very  much like a small boy after completing a recitation before visiting  dignitaries from the Board of Education.\n\n\n \"Just so.\" Abd Sadha nodded. \"April 18, 1976. And on this site. You  see, young man, you will materialize at the very moment and on the  very spot where the remote-control station handling the missile  was\u2014er\u2014handling the missile. You will be in a superb position, a  superb position, to deflect the missile in its downward course and  alter human history for the better. Very much for the better. Yes.\"\n\n\n He paused, having evidently stumbled out of his thought sequence.\n\n\n \"And he pulls the red switch toward him,\" Gomez, the dandelion-root  magnate, reminded him sharply, impatiently.\n\n\n \"Ah, yes, the red switch. He pulls the little red switch toward him.  Thank you, Mr. Gomez, thank you very much, sir. He pulls the little  red switch on the green instrument panel toward him, thus preventing  the error that caused the missile to explode in the Brazilian jungle  and causing it, instead, to explode somewhere in the mid-Pacific, as  originally planned.\"\n\n\n The Secretary-General of the United Nations beamed. \"Thus preventing  the Blight, making it nonexistent, as it were, producing a present-day  world in which the Blight never occurred. That is correct, is it not,  gentlemen?\" he asked, turning anxiously again. None of the half-dozen men on couches deigned to answer him. And  Alben kept his eyes deferentially in their direction, too, as he had  throughout this period of last-minute instruction.\n\n\n He knew who ruled his world\u2014these stolid, well-fed men in clean  garments with a minimum of patches, and where patches occurred, at  least they were the color of the surrounding cloth.\n\n\n Sadha might be Secretary-General of the United Nations, but that  was still a civil-service job, only a few social notches higher  than a chicken guard. His clothes were fully as ragged, fully as  multi-colored, as those that Alben had stepped out of. And the gnawing  in his stomach was no doubt almost as great.\n\n\n \"You understand, do you not, young man, that if anything goes wrong,\"  Abd Sadha asked, his head nodding tremulously and anticipating the  answer, \"if anything unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to  continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"\n\n\n \"He understands everything he has to understand,\" Gomez told him.  \"Let's get this thing moving.\"\n\n\n The old man smiled again. \"Yes. Of course, Mr. Gomez.\" He came up to  where Alben stood in the entrance of the time machine and handed the  sealed metal cylinder to him. \"This is the precaution the scientists  have just added. When you arrive at your destination, just before  materializing, you will release it into the surrounding temporal  medium. Our purpose here, as you no doubt\u2014\"\n\n\n Levney sat up on his couch and snapped his fingers peremptorily. \"I  just heard Gomez tell you to get this thing moving, Sadha. And it isn't  moving. We're busy men. We've wasted enough time.\"\n\n\n \"I was just trying to explain a crucial final fact,\" the  Secretary-General apologized. \"A fact which may be highly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've explained enough facts.\" Levney turned to the man inside the  time machine. \"Hey, fella. You. Move! \"\n\n\n Max Alben gulped and nodded violently. He darted to the rear of the  machine and turned the dial which activated it. flick! It was a good job and Mac Albin knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed as he looked at the morose faces  of his two colleagues. Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek had done as much as he  to build the tiny time machine in the secret lab under the helicopter  garage, and they were fully as eager to go, but\u2014unfortunately for  them\u2014they were not descended from the right ancestor.\n\n\n Leisurely, he unzipped the richly embroidered garment that, as the  father of two children, he was privileged to wear, and wriggled into  the housing of the complex little mechanism. This was hardly the  first time he had seen it, since he'd been helping to build the device  from the moment Honek had nodded and risen from the drafting board,  and now he barely wasted a glance on the thumb-size translucent coils  growing out of the almost microscopic energy bubbles which powered them.\n\n\n This machine was the last hope, of 2089, even if the world of 2089, as  a whole, did not know of its existence and would try to prevent its  being put into operation. But it meant a lot more to Mac Albin than  merely saving a world. It meant an adventurous mission with the risk of  death.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed again happily.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Epidemic, it would never have been discovered that he and  his seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the Albins would not have become  physicists upon the passage of the United Nations law that everyone  on Earth\u2014absolutely without exception\u2014had to choose a branch of  research science in which to specialize. In the flabby, careful,  life-guarding world the Earth had become, Mac Albin would never have  been reluctantly selected by his two co-workers as the one to carry the  forbidden banner of dangerous experiment.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Mac Albin would  probably be a biologist today like almost everyone else on Earth,  laboriously working out dreary gene problems instead of embarking on  the greatest adventure Man had known to date.\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, he had at last found a socially useful  escape from genetic responsibility to humanity in general and his own  family in particular. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Mac,\" Skeat said and crossed to the other side of the  narrow laboratory. Albin and Honek watched him stuff several sheets of paper into a small  metal box which he closed without locking.\n\n\n \"You will take care of yourself, won't you, Mac?\" Hugo Honek pleaded.  \"Any time you feel like taking an unnecessary risk, remember that Bob  and I will have to stand trial if you don't come back. We might be  sentenced to complete loss of professional status and spend the rest of  our lives supervising robot factories.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it won't be that bad,\" Albin reassured him absent-mindedly from  where he lay contorted inside the time machine. He watched Skeat coming  toward him with the box.\n\n\n Honek shrugged his shoulders. \"It might be a lot worse than even that  and you know it. The disappearance of a two-time father is going to  leave an awful big vacancy in the world. One-timers, like Bob and  me, are all over the place; if either of us dropped out of sight, it  wouldn't cause nearly as much uproar.\"\n\n\n \"But Bob and you both tried to operate the machine,\" Albin reminded  him. \"And you blacked out after a fifteen-second temporal displacement.  So I'm the only chance, the only way to stop the human race from  dwindling and dwindling till it hits absolute zero, like that fat old  Security Council seems willing for it to do.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Mac,\" Bob Skeat said as he handed the metal box to  Albin. \"The Security Council is just trying to solve the problem in  their way, the conservative way: a worldwide concentration on genetics  research coupled with the maximum preservation of existing human lives,  especially those that have a high reproductive potential. We three  disagree with them; we've been skulking down here nights to solve it our way, and ours is a radical approach and plenty risky. That's  the reason for the metal box\u2014trying to cover one more explosive  possibility.\"\n\n\n Albin turned it around curiously. \"How?\"\n\n\n \"I sat up all last night writing the manuscript that's inside it. Look,  Mac, when you go back to the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976 and  push that red switch away from you, a lot of other things are going to  happen than just deflecting the missile so that it will explode in the  Brazilian jungle instead of the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. I know. If it explodes in the jungle, the Epidemic doesn't  occur. No Shapiro's Mumps.\"\n\n\n Skeat jiggled his pudgy little face impatiently. \"That's not what I  mean. The Epidemic doesn't occur, but something else does. A new world,  a different 2089, an alternate time sequence. It'll be a world in which  humanity has a better chance to survive, but it'll be one with problems  of its own. Maybe tough problems. Maybe the problems will be tough  enough so that they'll get the same idea we did and try to go back to  the same point in time to change them.\" Albin laughed. \"That's just looking for trouble.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it is, but that's my job. Hugo's the designer of the time  machine and you're the operator, but I'm the theoretical man in this  research team. It's my job to look for trouble. So, just in case, I  wrote a brief history of the world from the time the missile exploded  in the Pacific. It tells why ours is the worst possible of futures.  It's in that box.\"\n\n\n \"What do I do with it\u2014hand it to the guy from the alternate 2089?\"\n\n\n The small fat man exasperatedly hit the side of the time machine with  a well-cushioned palm. \"You know better. There won't be any alternate  2089 until you push that red switch on the green instrument panel. The  moment you do, our world, with all its slow slide to extinction, goes  out and its alternate goes on\u2014just like two electric light bulbs on a  push-pull circuit. We and every single one of our artifacts, including  the time machine, disappear. The problem is how to keep that manuscript  from disappearing.\n\n\n \"Well, all you do, if I have this figured right, is shove the metal  box containing the manuscript out into the surrounding temporal medium  a moment before you materialize to do your job. That temporal medium  in which you'll be traveling is something that exists independent of  and autonomous to all possible futures. It's my hunch that something  that's immersed in it will not be altered by a new time sequence.\" \"Remind him to be careful, Bob,\" Honek rumbled. \"He thinks he's Captain  Blood and this is his big chance to run away to sea and become a  swashbuckling pirate.\"\n\n\n Albin grimaced in annoyance. \"I am excited by doing something  besides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions for the first time in my life. But I know that this is a  first experiment. Honestly, Hugo, I really have enough intelligence to  recognize that simple fact. I know that if anything unexpected pops up,  anything we didn't foresee, I'm supposed to come scuttling back and ask  for advice.\"\n\n\n \"I hope you do,\" Bob Skeat sighed. \"I hope you do know that. A  twentieth century poet once wrote something to the effect that the  world will end not with a bang, but a whimper. Well, our world is  ending with a whimper. Try to see that it doesn't end with a bang,  either.\"\n\n\n \"That I'll promise you,\" Albin said a trifle disgustedly. \"It'll end  with neither a bang nor a whimper. So long, Hugo. So long, Bob.\"\n\n\n He twisted around, reaching overhead for the lever which activated the  forces that drove the time machine. flick! It was strange, Max Alben reflected, that this time travel business,  which knocked unconscious everyone who tried it, only made him feel  slightly dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni,  he had been told. There must be some complicated scientific explanation  for it, he decided\u2014and that would make it none of his business. Better  forget about it.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a heavy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of patrolling his beat at the North American Chicken Reservation in a  thick fog.\n\n\n According to his gauges, he was now in 1976. He cut speed until he hit  the last day of April, then cut speed again, drifting slowly backward  to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile Experiment.  Carefully, carefully, like a man handling a strange bomb made on a  strange planet, he watched the center gauge until the needle came to  rest against the thin etched line that indicated the exactly crucial  moment. Then he pulled the brake and stopped the machine dead.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  pull the red switch toward him. Then his well-paid assignment would be  done.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He stopped and scratched his dirt-matted hair. Wasn't there something  he was supposed to do a second before materialization? Yes, that  useless old windbag, Sadha, had given him a last instruction.\n\n\n He picked up the sealed metal cylinder, walked to the entrance of the  time machine and tossed it into the gray murk. A solid object floating  near the entrance caught his eye. He put his arm out\u2014whew, it was  cold!\u2014and pulled it inside.\n\n\n A small metal box. Funny. What was it doing out there? Curiously,  he opened it, hoping to find something valuable. Nothing but a few  sheets of paper, Alben noted disappointedly. He began to read them  slowly, very slowly, for the manuscript was full of a lot of long and  complicated words, like a letter from one bookworm scientist to another.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976,  he read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was  the one of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been  warning about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the  Pacific Ocean as planned, the physicists and the military men went  home to study their notes, and the world shivered once more over the  approaching war and tried to forget about it.\n\n\n But there was fallout, a radioactive rain several hundred miles to  the north, and a small fishing fleet got thoroughly soaked by it.  Fortunately, the radioactivity in the rain was sufficiently low to do  little obvious physical damage: All it did was cause a mutation in the  mumps virus that several of the men in the fleet were incubating at the  time, having caught it from the children of the fishing town, among  whom a minor epidemic was raging. The fleet returned to its home town, which promptly came down with the  new kind of mumps. Dr. Llewellyn Shapiro, the only physician in town,  was the first man to note that, while the symptoms of this disease were  substantially milder than those of its unmutated parent, practically no  one was immune to it and its effects on human reproductivity were truly  terrible. Most people were completely sterilized by it. The rest were  rendered much less capable of fathering or bearing offspring.\n\n\n Shapiro's Mumps spread over the entire planet in the next few decades.  It leaped across every quarantine erected; for a long time, it  successfully defied all the vaccines and serums attempted against  it. Then, when a vaccine was finally perfected, humanity discovered  to its dismay that its generative powers had been permanently and  fundamentally impaired.\n\n\n Something had happened to the germ plasm. A large percentage of  individuals were born sterile, and, of those who were not, one child  was usually the most that could be expected, a two-child parent being  quite rare and a three-child parent almost unknown.\n\n\n Strict eugenic control was instituted by the Security Council of the  United Nations so that fertile men and women would not be wasted upon  non-fertile mates. Fertility was the most important avenue to social  status, and right after it came successful genetic research.\n\n\n Genetic research had the very best minds prodded into it; the lesser  ones went into the other sciences. Everyone on Earth was engaged in  some form of scientific research to some extent. Since the population  was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all  physical labor had long been done by robots. The government saw to it  that everybody had an ample supply of goods and, in return, asked only  that they experiment without any risk to their own lives\u2014every human  being was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\n\n\n There were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger  point, it had been estimated, where a species might be wiped out by a  new calamity. Not that another calamity would be needed. Since the end  of the Epidemic, the birth rate had been moving further and further  behind the death rate. In another century....\n\n\n That was why a desperate and secret attempt to alter the past was being  made. This kind of world was evidently impossible.\n\n\n Max Alben finished the manuscript and sighed. What a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\n\n\n He walked to the rear dials and began the process of materializing at  the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! It was odd, Mac Albin reflected, that these temporal journeys, which  induced coma in everyone who tried it, only made him feel slightly  dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni, he  knew. Maybe there was some genetic relationship with his above-average  fertility\u2014might be a good idea to mention the idea to a biologist or  two when he returned. If he returned.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a soupy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of the problems of landing a helicopter in a thick fog when the robot  butler had not been told to turn on the ground lights.\n\n\n According to the insulated register, he was now in 1976. He lowered  speed until he registered April, then maneuvered slowly backward  through time to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile  Experiment. Carefully, carefully, like an obstetrician supervising  surgical robots at an unusually difficult birth, he watched the  register until it rolled to rest against the notch that indicated the  exactly crucial moment. Then he pushed a button and froze the machine  where it was.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  push the red switch from him. Then his exciting adventure would be over.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He paused and tapped at his sleek chin. He was supposed to do something  a second before materialization. Yes, that nervous theoretician, Bob  Skeat, had given him a last suggestion.\n\n\n He picked up the small metal box, twisted around to face the opening  of the time machine and dropped it into the gray murk. A solid object  floating near the opening attracted his attention. He shot his arm  out\u2014it was cold , as cold as they had figured\u2014and pulled the object  inside.\n\n\n A sealed metal cylinder. Strange. What was it doing out there?  Anxiously, he opened it, not daring to believe he'd find a document  inside. Yes, that was exactly what it was, he saw excitedly. He began  to read it rapidly, very rapidly, as if it were a newly published paper  on neutrinos. Besides, the manuscript was written with almost painful  simplicity, like a textbook composed by a stuffy pedagogue for the use  of morons.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976, he  read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was the one  of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been warning  about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the Brazilian  jungle through some absolutely unforgivable error in the remote-control  station, the officer in charge of the station was reprimanded and the  men under him court-martialed, and the Brazilian government was paid a  handsome compensation for the damage. But there had been more damage than anyone knew at the time. A plant  virus, similar to the tobacco mosaic, had mutated under the impact  of radioactivity. Five years later, it burst out of the jungle and  completely wiped out every last rice plant on Earth. Japan and a large  part of Asia became semi-deserts inhabited by a few struggling nomads.\n\n\n Then the virus adjusted to wheat and corn\u2014and famine howled in every  street of the planet. All attempts by botanists to control the Blight  failed because of the swiftness of its onslaught. And after it had fed,  it hit again at a new plant and another and another.\n\n\n Most of the world's non-human mammals had been slaughtered for food  long before they could starve to death. Many insects, too, before they  became extinct at the loss of their edible plants, served to assuage  hunger to some small extent.\n\n\n But the nutritive potential of Earth was steadily diminishing in a  horrifying geometric progression. Recently, it had been observed,  plankton\u2014the tiny organism on which most of the sea's ecology was  based\u2014had started to disappear, and with its diminution, dead fish had  begun to pile up on the beaches.\n\n\n Mankind had lunged out desperately in all directions in an effort to  survive, but nothing had worked for any length of time. Even the other  planets of the Solar System, which had been reached and explored  at a tremendous cost in remaining resources, had yielded no edible  vegetation. Synthetics had failed to fill the prodigious gap.\n\n\n In the midst of the sharply increasing hunger, social controls had  pretty much dissolved. Pathetic attempts at rationing still continued,  but black markets became the only markets, and black marketeers the  barons of life. Starvation took the hindmost, and only the most agile  economically lived in comparative comfort. Law and order were had only  by those who could afford to pay for them and children of impoverished  families were sold on the open market for a bit of food.\n\n\n But the Blight was still adjusting to new plants and the food supply  kept shrinking. In another century....\n\n\n That was why the planet's powerful individuals had been persuaded to  pool their wealth in a desperate attempt to alter the past. This kind  of world was manifestly impossible.\n\n\n Mac Albin finished the document and sighed. What a magnificent world!  What an exciting place to live!\n\n\n He dropped his hand on the side levers and began the process of  materializing at the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to take on a  blurred reality all around him, Max Alben felt a bit of fear at what  he was doing. The technicians, he remembered, the Secretary-General,  even the black market kings, had all warned him not to go ahead with  his instructions if anything unusual turned up. That was an awful lot  of power to disobey: he knew he should return with this new information  and let better minds work on it.\n\n\n They with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been  like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger, scrabbling, servility, and  more hunger. Every time things got really tight, you and your wife  looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring  the best price. Buying security for them, as he was now, at the risk of  his life.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, there was a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children. A man like himself, with five children\u2014why, he'd be a big man, maybe the biggest man on  Earth! And he'd have robots to work for him and lots of food. Above  all, lots and lots of food.\n\n\n He'd even be a scientist\u2014 everyone was a scientist there, weren't  they?\u2014and he'd have a big laboratory all to himself. This other world  had its troubles, but it was a lot nicer place than where he'd come  from. He wouldn't return. He'd go through with it.\n\n\n The fear left him and, for the first time in his life, Max Alben felt  the sensation of power.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  sweating a bit at the sight of the roomful of military figures, despite  the technicians' reassurances that all this would be happening too fast  to be visible. He saw the single red switch pointing upward on the  instrument panel. The switch that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to oscillate into  reality all around him, Mac Albin felt a bit of shame at what he was  doing. He'd promised Bob and Hugo to drop the experiment at any stage  if a new factor showed up. He knew he should go back with this new  information and have all three of them kick it around.\n\n\n But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful  adjustment to their thoroughly blueprinted lives? They, at least, had  been ordered to marry women they could live with; he'd drawn a female  with whom he was completely incompatible in any but a genetic sense.  Genetics! He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. He was tired of having to undertake a simple  adventure like a thief in the night.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, someone like himself would  be a monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own  rules, taking his own women. So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n\n\n He'd formed a pretty good idea of the kind of men who ruled that other  world, from the document in the sealed metal cylinder. The black  marketeers had not even read it. Why, the fools had obviously been  duped by the technicians into permitting the experiment; they had not  grasped the idea that an alternate time track would mean their own  non-existence.\n\n\n This other world had its troubles, but it was certainly a livelier  place than where he'd come from. It deserved a chance. Yes, that was  how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate was  starving but managing to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\n\n\n Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  disregarding the roomful of military figures since he knew they could  not see him. The single red switch pointed downward on the instrument  panel. That was the gimmick that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! ... pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... toward him. flick! ... from him. flick! \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Max think the world in the story was wonderful?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Everyone had plenty of everything they needed\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There were very few people\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There were very few people\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There were very few people\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered as he hurried into the  laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,  despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads  deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men  lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.\n\n\n He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the  anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.  This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught  how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great  transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.\n\n\n This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost  outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,  and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also  that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,  being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered again affectionately.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Blight, it would never have been discovered that he and his  seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the ruling powers of Earth, more  than a century later, would never have plucked Max Alben out of an  obscure civil-service job as a relief guard at the North American  Chicken Reservation to his present heroic and remunerative eminence.  He would still be patrolling the barbed wire that surrounded the three  white leghorn hens and two roosters\u2014about one-sixth of the known  livestock wealth of the Western Hemisphere\u2014thoroughly content with  the half-pail of dried apricots he received each and every payday.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Max Alben would  not now be shifting from foot to foot in a physics laboratory,  facing the black market kings of the world and awaiting their final  instructions with an uncertain and submissive grin. Men like O'Hara, who controlled mushrooms, Levney, the blackberry  tycoon, Sorgasso, the packaged-worm monopolist\u2014would black marketeers  of their tremendous stature so much as waste a glance on someone like  Alben ordinarily, let alone confer a lifetime pension on his wife and  five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar a day?\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family on Earth. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n Alben noticed that Abd Sadha had risen from the straight chair at  the far side of the room and was approaching him with a sealed metal  cylinder in one hand.\n\n\n \"We've decided to add a further precaution at the last moment,\" the old  man said. \"That is, the scientists have suggested it and I have\u2014er\u2014I  have given my approval.\"\n\n\n The last remark was added with a slight questioning note as the  Secretary-General of the United Nations looked back rapidly at the  black market princes on the couches behind him. Since they stared back  stonily, but offered no objection, he coughed in relief and returned to  Alben.\n\n\n \"I am sure, young man, that I don't have to go into the details of your  instructions once more. You enter the time machine and go back the  duration for which it has been preset, a hundred and thirteen years, to  the moment after the Guided Missile of 1976 was launched. It is 1976,  isn't it?\" he asked, suddenly uncertain.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" one of the technicians standing by the time machine said  respectfully. \"The experiment with an atomic warhead guided missile  that resulted in the Blight was conducted on this site on April 18,  1976.\" He glanced proudly at the unemotional men on the couches, very  much like a small boy after completing a recitation before visiting  dignitaries from the Board of Education.\n\n\n \"Just so.\" Abd Sadha nodded. \"April 18, 1976. And on this site. You  see, young man, you will materialize at the very moment and on the  very spot where the remote-control station handling the missile  was\u2014er\u2014handling the missile. You will be in a superb position, a  superb position, to deflect the missile in its downward course and  alter human history for the better. Very much for the better. Yes.\"\n\n\n He paused, having evidently stumbled out of his thought sequence.\n\n\n \"And he pulls the red switch toward him,\" Gomez, the dandelion-root  magnate, reminded him sharply, impatiently.\n\n\n \"Ah, yes, the red switch. He pulls the little red switch toward him.  Thank you, Mr. Gomez, thank you very much, sir. He pulls the little  red switch on the green instrument panel toward him, thus preventing  the error that caused the missile to explode in the Brazilian jungle  and causing it, instead, to explode somewhere in the mid-Pacific, as  originally planned.\"\n\n\n The Secretary-General of the United Nations beamed. \"Thus preventing  the Blight, making it nonexistent, as it were, producing a present-day  world in which the Blight never occurred. That is correct, is it not,  gentlemen?\" he asked, turning anxiously again. None of the half-dozen men on couches deigned to answer him. And  Alben kept his eyes deferentially in their direction, too, as he had  throughout this period of last-minute instruction.\n\n\n He knew who ruled his world\u2014these stolid, well-fed men in clean  garments with a minimum of patches, and where patches occurred, at  least they were the color of the surrounding cloth.\n\n\n Sadha might be Secretary-General of the United Nations, but that  was still a civil-service job, only a few social notches higher  than a chicken guard. His clothes were fully as ragged, fully as  multi-colored, as those that Alben had stepped out of. And the gnawing  in his stomach was no doubt almost as great.\n\n\n \"You understand, do you not, young man, that if anything goes wrong,\"  Abd Sadha asked, his head nodding tremulously and anticipating the  answer, \"if anything unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to  continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"\n\n\n \"He understands everything he has to understand,\" Gomez told him.  \"Let's get this thing moving.\"\n\n\n The old man smiled again. \"Yes. Of course, Mr. Gomez.\" He came up to  where Alben stood in the entrance of the time machine and handed the  sealed metal cylinder to him. \"This is the precaution the scientists  have just added. When you arrive at your destination, just before  materializing, you will release it into the surrounding temporal  medium. Our purpose here, as you no doubt\u2014\"\n\n\n Levney sat up on his couch and snapped his fingers peremptorily. \"I  just heard Gomez tell you to get this thing moving, Sadha. And it isn't  moving. We're busy men. We've wasted enough time.\"\n\n\n \"I was just trying to explain a crucial final fact,\" the  Secretary-General apologized. \"A fact which may be highly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've explained enough facts.\" Levney turned to the man inside the  time machine. \"Hey, fella. You. Move! \"\n\n\n Max Alben gulped and nodded violently. He darted to the rear of the  machine and turned the dial which activated it. flick! It was a good job and Mac Albin knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed as he looked at the morose faces  of his two colleagues. Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek had done as much as he  to build the tiny time machine in the secret lab under the helicopter  garage, and they were fully as eager to go, but\u2014unfortunately for  them\u2014they were not descended from the right ancestor.\n\n\n Leisurely, he unzipped the richly embroidered garment that, as the  father of two children, he was privileged to wear, and wriggled into  the housing of the complex little mechanism. This was hardly the  first time he had seen it, since he'd been helping to build the device  from the moment Honek had nodded and risen from the drafting board,  and now he barely wasted a glance on the thumb-size translucent coils  growing out of the almost microscopic energy bubbles which powered them.\n\n\n This machine was the last hope, of 2089, even if the world of 2089, as  a whole, did not know of its existence and would try to prevent its  being put into operation. But it meant a lot more to Mac Albin than  merely saving a world. It meant an adventurous mission with the risk of  death.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed again happily.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Epidemic, it would never have been discovered that he and  his seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the Albins would not have become  physicists upon the passage of the United Nations law that everyone  on Earth\u2014absolutely without exception\u2014had to choose a branch of  research science in which to specialize. In the flabby, careful,  life-guarding world the Earth had become, Mac Albin would never have  been reluctantly selected by his two co-workers as the one to carry the  forbidden banner of dangerous experiment.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Mac Albin would  probably be a biologist today like almost everyone else on Earth,  laboriously working out dreary gene problems instead of embarking on  the greatest adventure Man had known to date.\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, he had at last found a socially useful  escape from genetic responsibility to humanity in general and his own  family in particular. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Mac,\" Skeat said and crossed to the other side of the  narrow laboratory. Albin and Honek watched him stuff several sheets of paper into a small  metal box which he closed without locking.\n\n\n \"You will take care of yourself, won't you, Mac?\" Hugo Honek pleaded.  \"Any time you feel like taking an unnecessary risk, remember that Bob  and I will have to stand trial if you don't come back. We might be  sentenced to complete loss of professional status and spend the rest of  our lives supervising robot factories.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it won't be that bad,\" Albin reassured him absent-mindedly from  where he lay contorted inside the time machine. He watched Skeat coming  toward him with the box.\n\n\n Honek shrugged his shoulders. \"It might be a lot worse than even that  and you know it. The disappearance of a two-time father is going to  leave an awful big vacancy in the world. One-timers, like Bob and  me, are all over the place; if either of us dropped out of sight, it  wouldn't cause nearly as much uproar.\"\n\n\n \"But Bob and you both tried to operate the machine,\" Albin reminded  him. \"And you blacked out after a fifteen-second temporal displacement.  So I'm the only chance, the only way to stop the human race from  dwindling and dwindling till it hits absolute zero, like that fat old  Security Council seems willing for it to do.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Mac,\" Bob Skeat said as he handed the metal box to  Albin. \"The Security Council is just trying to solve the problem in  their way, the conservative way: a worldwide concentration on genetics  research coupled with the maximum preservation of existing human lives,  especially those that have a high reproductive potential. We three  disagree with them; we've been skulking down here nights to solve it our way, and ours is a radical approach and plenty risky. That's  the reason for the metal box\u2014trying to cover one more explosive  possibility.\"\n\n\n Albin turned it around curiously. \"How?\"\n\n\n \"I sat up all last night writing the manuscript that's inside it. Look,  Mac, when you go back to the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976 and  push that red switch away from you, a lot of other things are going to  happen than just deflecting the missile so that it will explode in the  Brazilian jungle instead of the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. I know. If it explodes in the jungle, the Epidemic doesn't  occur. No Shapiro's Mumps.\"\n\n\n Skeat jiggled his pudgy little face impatiently. \"That's not what I  mean. The Epidemic doesn't occur, but something else does. A new world,  a different 2089, an alternate time sequence. It'll be a world in which  humanity has a better chance to survive, but it'll be one with problems  of its own. Maybe tough problems. Maybe the problems will be tough  enough so that they'll get the same idea we did and try to go back to  the same point in time to change them.\" Albin laughed. \"That's just looking for trouble.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it is, but that's my job. Hugo's the designer of the time  machine and you're the operator, but I'm the theoretical man in this  research team. It's my job to look for trouble. So, just in case, I  wrote a brief history of the world from the time the missile exploded  in the Pacific. It tells why ours is the worst possible of futures.  It's in that box.\"\n\n\n \"What do I do with it\u2014hand it to the guy from the alternate 2089?\"\n\n\n The small fat man exasperatedly hit the side of the time machine with  a well-cushioned palm. \"You know better. There won't be any alternate  2089 until you push that red switch on the green instrument panel. The  moment you do, our world, with all its slow slide to extinction, goes  out and its alternate goes on\u2014just like two electric light bulbs on a  push-pull circuit. We and every single one of our artifacts, including  the time machine, disappear. The problem is how to keep that manuscript  from disappearing.\n\n\n \"Well, all you do, if I have this figured right, is shove the metal  box containing the manuscript out into the surrounding temporal medium  a moment before you materialize to do your job. That temporal medium  in which you'll be traveling is something that exists independent of  and autonomous to all possible futures. It's my hunch that something  that's immersed in it will not be altered by a new time sequence.\" \"Remind him to be careful, Bob,\" Honek rumbled. \"He thinks he's Captain  Blood and this is his big chance to run away to sea and become a  swashbuckling pirate.\"\n\n\n Albin grimaced in annoyance. \"I am excited by doing something  besides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions for the first time in my life. But I know that this is a  first experiment. Honestly, Hugo, I really have enough intelligence to  recognize that simple fact. I know that if anything unexpected pops up,  anything we didn't foresee, I'm supposed to come scuttling back and ask  for advice.\"\n\n\n \"I hope you do,\" Bob Skeat sighed. \"I hope you do know that. A  twentieth century poet once wrote something to the effect that the  world will end not with a bang, but a whimper. Well, our world is  ending with a whimper. Try to see that it doesn't end with a bang,  either.\"\n\n\n \"That I'll promise you,\" Albin said a trifle disgustedly. \"It'll end  with neither a bang nor a whimper. So long, Hugo. So long, Bob.\"\n\n\n He twisted around, reaching overhead for the lever which activated the  forces that drove the time machine. flick! It was strange, Max Alben reflected, that this time travel business,  which knocked unconscious everyone who tried it, only made him feel  slightly dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni,  he had been told. There must be some complicated scientific explanation  for it, he decided\u2014and that would make it none of his business. Better  forget about it.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a heavy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of patrolling his beat at the North American Chicken Reservation in a  thick fog.\n\n\n According to his gauges, he was now in 1976. He cut speed until he hit  the last day of April, then cut speed again, drifting slowly backward  to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile Experiment.  Carefully, carefully, like a man handling a strange bomb made on a  strange planet, he watched the center gauge until the needle came to  rest against the thin etched line that indicated the exactly crucial  moment. Then he pulled the brake and stopped the machine dead.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  pull the red switch toward him. Then his well-paid assignment would be  done.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He stopped and scratched his dirt-matted hair. Wasn't there something  he was supposed to do a second before materialization? Yes, that  useless old windbag, Sadha, had given him a last instruction.\n\n\n He picked up the sealed metal cylinder, walked to the entrance of the  time machine and tossed it into the gray murk. A solid object floating  near the entrance caught his eye. He put his arm out\u2014whew, it was  cold!\u2014and pulled it inside.\n\n\n A small metal box. Funny. What was it doing out there? Curiously,  he opened it, hoping to find something valuable. Nothing but a few  sheets of paper, Alben noted disappointedly. He began to read them  slowly, very slowly, for the manuscript was full of a lot of long and  complicated words, like a letter from one bookworm scientist to another.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976,  he read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was  the one of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been  warning about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the  Pacific Ocean as planned, the physicists and the military men went  home to study their notes, and the world shivered once more over the  approaching war and tried to forget about it.\n\n\n But there was fallout, a radioactive rain several hundred miles to  the north, and a small fishing fleet got thoroughly soaked by it.  Fortunately, the radioactivity in the rain was sufficiently low to do  little obvious physical damage: All it did was cause a mutation in the  mumps virus that several of the men in the fleet were incubating at the  time, having caught it from the children of the fishing town, among  whom a minor epidemic was raging. The fleet returned to its home town, which promptly came down with the  new kind of mumps. Dr. Llewellyn Shapiro, the only physician in town,  was the first man to note that, while the symptoms of this disease were  substantially milder than those of its unmutated parent, practically no  one was immune to it and its effects on human reproductivity were truly  terrible. Most people were completely sterilized by it. The rest were  rendered much less capable of fathering or bearing offspring.\n\n\n Shapiro's Mumps spread over the entire planet in the next few decades.  It leaped across every quarantine erected; for a long time, it  successfully defied all the vaccines and serums attempted against  it. Then, when a vaccine was finally perfected, humanity discovered  to its dismay that its generative powers had been permanently and  fundamentally impaired.\n\n\n Something had happened to the germ plasm. A large percentage of  individuals were born sterile, and, of those who were not, one child  was usually the most that could be expected, a two-child parent being  quite rare and a three-child parent almost unknown.\n\n\n Strict eugenic control was instituted by the Security Council of the  United Nations so that fertile men and women would not be wasted upon  non-fertile mates. Fertility was the most important avenue to social  status, and right after it came successful genetic research.\n\n\n Genetic research had the very best minds prodded into it; the lesser  ones went into the other sciences. Everyone on Earth was engaged in  some form of scientific research to some extent. Since the population  was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all  physical labor had long been done by robots. The government saw to it  that everybody had an ample supply of goods and, in return, asked only  that they experiment without any risk to their own lives\u2014every human  being was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\n\n\n There were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger  point, it had been estimated, where a species might be wiped out by a  new calamity. Not that another calamity would be needed. Since the end  of the Epidemic, the birth rate had been moving further and further  behind the death rate. In another century....\n\n\n That was why a desperate and secret attempt to alter the past was being  made. This kind of world was evidently impossible.\n\n\n Max Alben finished the manuscript and sighed. What a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\n\n\n He walked to the rear dials and began the process of materializing at  the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! It was odd, Mac Albin reflected, that these temporal journeys, which  induced coma in everyone who tried it, only made him feel slightly  dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni, he  knew. Maybe there was some genetic relationship with his above-average  fertility\u2014might be a good idea to mention the idea to a biologist or  two when he returned. If he returned.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a soupy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of the problems of landing a helicopter in a thick fog when the robot  butler had not been told to turn on the ground lights.\n\n\n According to the insulated register, he was now in 1976. He lowered  speed until he registered April, then maneuvered slowly backward  through time to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile  Experiment. Carefully, carefully, like an obstetrician supervising  surgical robots at an unusually difficult birth, he watched the  register until it rolled to rest against the notch that indicated the  exactly crucial moment. Then he pushed a button and froze the machine  where it was.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  push the red switch from him. Then his exciting adventure would be over.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He paused and tapped at his sleek chin. He was supposed to do something  a second before materialization. Yes, that nervous theoretician, Bob  Skeat, had given him a last suggestion.\n\n\n He picked up the small metal box, twisted around to face the opening  of the time machine and dropped it into the gray murk. A solid object  floating near the opening attracted his attention. He shot his arm  out\u2014it was cold , as cold as they had figured\u2014and pulled the object  inside.\n\n\n A sealed metal cylinder. Strange. What was it doing out there?  Anxiously, he opened it, not daring to believe he'd find a document  inside. Yes, that was exactly what it was, he saw excitedly. He began  to read it rapidly, very rapidly, as if it were a newly published paper  on neutrinos. Besides, the manuscript was written with almost painful  simplicity, like a textbook composed by a stuffy pedagogue for the use  of morons.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976, he  read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was the one  of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been warning  about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the Brazilian  jungle through some absolutely unforgivable error in the remote-control  station, the officer in charge of the station was reprimanded and the  men under him court-martialed, and the Brazilian government was paid a  handsome compensation for the damage. But there had been more damage than anyone knew at the time. A plant  virus, similar to the tobacco mosaic, had mutated under the impact  of radioactivity. Five years later, it burst out of the jungle and  completely wiped out every last rice plant on Earth. Japan and a large  part of Asia became semi-deserts inhabited by a few struggling nomads.\n\n\n Then the virus adjusted to wheat and corn\u2014and famine howled in every  street of the planet. All attempts by botanists to control the Blight  failed because of the swiftness of its onslaught. And after it had fed,  it hit again at a new plant and another and another.\n\n\n Most of the world's non-human mammals had been slaughtered for food  long before they could starve to death. Many insects, too, before they  became extinct at the loss of their edible plants, served to assuage  hunger to some small extent.\n\n\n But the nutritive potential of Earth was steadily diminishing in a  horrifying geometric progression. Recently, it had been observed,  plankton\u2014the tiny organism on which most of the sea's ecology was  based\u2014had started to disappear, and with its diminution, dead fish had  begun to pile up on the beaches.\n\n\n Mankind had lunged out desperately in all directions in an effort to  survive, but nothing had worked for any length of time. Even the other  planets of the Solar System, which had been reached and explored  at a tremendous cost in remaining resources, had yielded no edible  vegetation. Synthetics had failed to fill the prodigious gap.\n\n\n In the midst of the sharply increasing hunger, social controls had  pretty much dissolved. Pathetic attempts at rationing still continued,  but black markets became the only markets, and black marketeers the  barons of life. Starvation took the hindmost, and only the most agile  economically lived in comparative comfort. Law and order were had only  by those who could afford to pay for them and children of impoverished  families were sold on the open market for a bit of food.\n\n\n But the Blight was still adjusting to new plants and the food supply  kept shrinking. In another century....\n\n\n That was why the planet's powerful individuals had been persuaded to  pool their wealth in a desperate attempt to alter the past. This kind  of world was manifestly impossible.\n\n\n Mac Albin finished the document and sighed. What a magnificent world!  What an exciting place to live!\n\n\n He dropped his hand on the side levers and began the process of  materializing at the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to take on a  blurred reality all around him, Max Alben felt a bit of fear at what  he was doing. The technicians, he remembered, the Secretary-General,  even the black market kings, had all warned him not to go ahead with  his instructions if anything unusual turned up. That was an awful lot  of power to disobey: he knew he should return with this new information  and let better minds work on it.\n\n\n They with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been  like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger, scrabbling, servility, and  more hunger. Every time things got really tight, you and your wife  looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring  the best price. Buying security for them, as he was now, at the risk of  his life.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, there was a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children. A man like himself, with five children\u2014why, he'd be a big man, maybe the biggest man on  Earth! And he'd have robots to work for him and lots of food. Above  all, lots and lots of food.\n\n\n He'd even be a scientist\u2014 everyone was a scientist there, weren't  they?\u2014and he'd have a big laboratory all to himself. This other world  had its troubles, but it was a lot nicer place than where he'd come  from. He wouldn't return. He'd go through with it.\n\n\n The fear left him and, for the first time in his life, Max Alben felt  the sensation of power.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  sweating a bit at the sight of the roomful of military figures, despite  the technicians' reassurances that all this would be happening too fast  to be visible. He saw the single red switch pointing upward on the  instrument panel. The switch that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to oscillate into  reality all around him, Mac Albin felt a bit of shame at what he was  doing. He'd promised Bob and Hugo to drop the experiment at any stage  if a new factor showed up. He knew he should go back with this new  information and have all three of them kick it around.\n\n\n But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful  adjustment to their thoroughly blueprinted lives? They, at least, had  been ordered to marry women they could live with; he'd drawn a female  with whom he was completely incompatible in any but a genetic sense.  Genetics! He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. He was tired of having to undertake a simple  adventure like a thief in the night.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, someone like himself would  be a monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own  rules, taking his own women. So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n\n\n He'd formed a pretty good idea of the kind of men who ruled that other  world, from the document in the sealed metal cylinder. The black  marketeers had not even read it. Why, the fools had obviously been  duped by the technicians into permitting the experiment; they had not  grasped the idea that an alternate time track would mean their own  non-existence.\n\n\n This other world had its troubles, but it was certainly a livelier  place than where he'd come from. It deserved a chance. Yes, that was  how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate was  starving but managing to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\n\n\n Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  disregarding the roomful of military figures since he knew they could  not see him. The single red switch pointed downward on the instrument  panel. That was the gimmick that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! ... pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... toward him. flick! ... from him. flick! \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Max think the world in the story was wonderful?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There were very few people\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Everyone had plenty of everything they needed\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Everyone had plenty of everything they needed\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Everyone had plenty of everything they needed\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered as he hurried into the  laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,  despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads  deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men  lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.\n\n\n He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the  anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.  This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught  how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great  transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.\n\n\n This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost  outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,  and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also  that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,  being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered again affectionately.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Blight, it would never have been discovered that he and his  seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the ruling powers of Earth, more  than a century later, would never have plucked Max Alben out of an  obscure civil-service job as a relief guard at the North American  Chicken Reservation to his present heroic and remunerative eminence.  He would still be patrolling the barbed wire that surrounded the three  white leghorn hens and two roosters\u2014about one-sixth of the known  livestock wealth of the Western Hemisphere\u2014thoroughly content with  the half-pail of dried apricots he received each and every payday.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Max Alben would  not now be shifting from foot to foot in a physics laboratory,  facing the black market kings of the world and awaiting their final  instructions with an uncertain and submissive grin. Men like O'Hara, who controlled mushrooms, Levney, the blackberry  tycoon, Sorgasso, the packaged-worm monopolist\u2014would black marketeers  of their tremendous stature so much as waste a glance on someone like  Alben ordinarily, let alone confer a lifetime pension on his wife and  five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar a day?\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family on Earth. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n Alben noticed that Abd Sadha had risen from the straight chair at  the far side of the room and was approaching him with a sealed metal  cylinder in one hand.\n\n\n \"We've decided to add a further precaution at the last moment,\" the old  man said. \"That is, the scientists have suggested it and I have\u2014er\u2014I  have given my approval.\"\n\n\n The last remark was added with a slight questioning note as the  Secretary-General of the United Nations looked back rapidly at the  black market princes on the couches behind him. Since they stared back  stonily, but offered no objection, he coughed in relief and returned to  Alben.\n\n\n \"I am sure, young man, that I don't have to go into the details of your  instructions once more. You enter the time machine and go back the  duration for which it has been preset, a hundred and thirteen years, to  the moment after the Guided Missile of 1976 was launched. It is 1976,  isn't it?\" he asked, suddenly uncertain.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" one of the technicians standing by the time machine said  respectfully. \"The experiment with an atomic warhead guided missile  that resulted in the Blight was conducted on this site on April 18,  1976.\" He glanced proudly at the unemotional men on the couches, very  much like a small boy after completing a recitation before visiting  dignitaries from the Board of Education.\n\n\n \"Just so.\" Abd Sadha nodded. \"April 18, 1976. And on this site. You  see, young man, you will materialize at the very moment and on the  very spot where the remote-control station handling the missile  was\u2014er\u2014handling the missile. You will be in a superb position, a  superb position, to deflect the missile in its downward course and  alter human history for the better. Very much for the better. Yes.\"\n\n\n He paused, having evidently stumbled out of his thought sequence.\n\n\n \"And he pulls the red switch toward him,\" Gomez, the dandelion-root  magnate, reminded him sharply, impatiently.\n\n\n \"Ah, yes, the red switch. He pulls the little red switch toward him.  Thank you, Mr. Gomez, thank you very much, sir. He pulls the little  red switch on the green instrument panel toward him, thus preventing  the error that caused the missile to explode in the Brazilian jungle  and causing it, instead, to explode somewhere in the mid-Pacific, as  originally planned.\"\n\n\n The Secretary-General of the United Nations beamed. \"Thus preventing  the Blight, making it nonexistent, as it were, producing a present-day  world in which the Blight never occurred. That is correct, is it not,  gentlemen?\" he asked, turning anxiously again. None of the half-dozen men on couches deigned to answer him. And  Alben kept his eyes deferentially in their direction, too, as he had  throughout this period of last-minute instruction.\n\n\n He knew who ruled his world\u2014these stolid, well-fed men in clean  garments with a minimum of patches, and where patches occurred, at  least they were the color of the surrounding cloth.\n\n\n Sadha might be Secretary-General of the United Nations, but that  was still a civil-service job, only a few social notches higher  than a chicken guard. His clothes were fully as ragged, fully as  multi-colored, as those that Alben had stepped out of. And the gnawing  in his stomach was no doubt almost as great.\n\n\n \"You understand, do you not, young man, that if anything goes wrong,\"  Abd Sadha asked, his head nodding tremulously and anticipating the  answer, \"if anything unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to  continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"\n\n\n \"He understands everything he has to understand,\" Gomez told him.  \"Let's get this thing moving.\"\n\n\n The old man smiled again. \"Yes. Of course, Mr. Gomez.\" He came up to  where Alben stood in the entrance of the time machine and handed the  sealed metal cylinder to him. \"This is the precaution the scientists  have just added. When you arrive at your destination, just before  materializing, you will release it into the surrounding temporal  medium. Our purpose here, as you no doubt\u2014\"\n\n\n Levney sat up on his couch and snapped his fingers peremptorily. \"I  just heard Gomez tell you to get this thing moving, Sadha. And it isn't  moving. We're busy men. We've wasted enough time.\"\n\n\n \"I was just trying to explain a crucial final fact,\" the  Secretary-General apologized. \"A fact which may be highly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've explained enough facts.\" Levney turned to the man inside the  time machine. \"Hey, fella. You. Move! \"\n\n\n Max Alben gulped and nodded violently. He darted to the rear of the  machine and turned the dial which activated it. flick! It was a good job and Mac Albin knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed as he looked at the morose faces  of his two colleagues. Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek had done as much as he  to build the tiny time machine in the secret lab under the helicopter  garage, and they were fully as eager to go, but\u2014unfortunately for  them\u2014they were not descended from the right ancestor.\n\n\n Leisurely, he unzipped the richly embroidered garment that, as the  father of two children, he was privileged to wear, and wriggled into  the housing of the complex little mechanism. This was hardly the  first time he had seen it, since he'd been helping to build the device  from the moment Honek had nodded and risen from the drafting board,  and now he barely wasted a glance on the thumb-size translucent coils  growing out of the almost microscopic energy bubbles which powered them.\n\n\n This machine was the last hope, of 2089, even if the world of 2089, as  a whole, did not know of its existence and would try to prevent its  being put into operation. But it meant a lot more to Mac Albin than  merely saving a world. It meant an adventurous mission with the risk of  death.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed again happily.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Epidemic, it would never have been discovered that he and  his seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the Albins would not have become  physicists upon the passage of the United Nations law that everyone  on Earth\u2014absolutely without exception\u2014had to choose a branch of  research science in which to specialize. In the flabby, careful,  life-guarding world the Earth had become, Mac Albin would never have  been reluctantly selected by his two co-workers as the one to carry the  forbidden banner of dangerous experiment.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Mac Albin would  probably be a biologist today like almost everyone else on Earth,  laboriously working out dreary gene problems instead of embarking on  the greatest adventure Man had known to date.\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, he had at last found a socially useful  escape from genetic responsibility to humanity in general and his own  family in particular. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Mac,\" Skeat said and crossed to the other side of the  narrow laboratory. Albin and Honek watched him stuff several sheets of paper into a small  metal box which he closed without locking.\n\n\n \"You will take care of yourself, won't you, Mac?\" Hugo Honek pleaded.  \"Any time you feel like taking an unnecessary risk, remember that Bob  and I will have to stand trial if you don't come back. We might be  sentenced to complete loss of professional status and spend the rest of  our lives supervising robot factories.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it won't be that bad,\" Albin reassured him absent-mindedly from  where he lay contorted inside the time machine. He watched Skeat coming  toward him with the box.\n\n\n Honek shrugged his shoulders. \"It might be a lot worse than even that  and you know it. The disappearance of a two-time father is going to  leave an awful big vacancy in the world. One-timers, like Bob and  me, are all over the place; if either of us dropped out of sight, it  wouldn't cause nearly as much uproar.\"\n\n\n \"But Bob and you both tried to operate the machine,\" Albin reminded  him. \"And you blacked out after a fifteen-second temporal displacement.  So I'm the only chance, the only way to stop the human race from  dwindling and dwindling till it hits absolute zero, like that fat old  Security Council seems willing for it to do.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Mac,\" Bob Skeat said as he handed the metal box to  Albin. \"The Security Council is just trying to solve the problem in  their way, the conservative way: a worldwide concentration on genetics  research coupled with the maximum preservation of existing human lives,  especially those that have a high reproductive potential. We three  disagree with them; we've been skulking down here nights to solve it our way, and ours is a radical approach and plenty risky. That's  the reason for the metal box\u2014trying to cover one more explosive  possibility.\"\n\n\n Albin turned it around curiously. \"How?\"\n\n\n \"I sat up all last night writing the manuscript that's inside it. Look,  Mac, when you go back to the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976 and  push that red switch away from you, a lot of other things are going to  happen than just deflecting the missile so that it will explode in the  Brazilian jungle instead of the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. I know. If it explodes in the jungle, the Epidemic doesn't  occur. No Shapiro's Mumps.\"\n\n\n Skeat jiggled his pudgy little face impatiently. \"That's not what I  mean. The Epidemic doesn't occur, but something else does. A new world,  a different 2089, an alternate time sequence. It'll be a world in which  humanity has a better chance to survive, but it'll be one with problems  of its own. Maybe tough problems. Maybe the problems will be tough  enough so that they'll get the same idea we did and try to go back to  the same point in time to change them.\" Albin laughed. \"That's just looking for trouble.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it is, but that's my job. Hugo's the designer of the time  machine and you're the operator, but I'm the theoretical man in this  research team. It's my job to look for trouble. So, just in case, I  wrote a brief history of the world from the time the missile exploded  in the Pacific. It tells why ours is the worst possible of futures.  It's in that box.\"\n\n\n \"What do I do with it\u2014hand it to the guy from the alternate 2089?\"\n\n\n The small fat man exasperatedly hit the side of the time machine with  a well-cushioned palm. \"You know better. There won't be any alternate  2089 until you push that red switch on the green instrument panel. The  moment you do, our world, with all its slow slide to extinction, goes  out and its alternate goes on\u2014just like two electric light bulbs on a  push-pull circuit. We and every single one of our artifacts, including  the time machine, disappear. The problem is how to keep that manuscript  from disappearing.\n\n\n \"Well, all you do, if I have this figured right, is shove the metal  box containing the manuscript out into the surrounding temporal medium  a moment before you materialize to do your job. That temporal medium  in which you'll be traveling is something that exists independent of  and autonomous to all possible futures. It's my hunch that something  that's immersed in it will not be altered by a new time sequence.\" \"Remind him to be careful, Bob,\" Honek rumbled. \"He thinks he's Captain  Blood and this is his big chance to run away to sea and become a  swashbuckling pirate.\"\n\n\n Albin grimaced in annoyance. \"I am excited by doing something  besides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions for the first time in my life. But I know that this is a  first experiment. Honestly, Hugo, I really have enough intelligence to  recognize that simple fact. I know that if anything unexpected pops up,  anything we didn't foresee, I'm supposed to come scuttling back and ask  for advice.\"\n\n\n \"I hope you do,\" Bob Skeat sighed. \"I hope you do know that. A  twentieth century poet once wrote something to the effect that the  world will end not with a bang, but a whimper. Well, our world is  ending with a whimper. Try to see that it doesn't end with a bang,  either.\"\n\n\n \"That I'll promise you,\" Albin said a trifle disgustedly. \"It'll end  with neither a bang nor a whimper. So long, Hugo. So long, Bob.\"\n\n\n He twisted around, reaching overhead for the lever which activated the  forces that drove the time machine. flick! It was strange, Max Alben reflected, that this time travel business,  which knocked unconscious everyone who tried it, only made him feel  slightly dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni,  he had been told. There must be some complicated scientific explanation  for it, he decided\u2014and that would make it none of his business. Better  forget about it.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a heavy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of patrolling his beat at the North American Chicken Reservation in a  thick fog.\n\n\n According to his gauges, he was now in 1976. He cut speed until he hit  the last day of April, then cut speed again, drifting slowly backward  to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile Experiment.  Carefully, carefully, like a man handling a strange bomb made on a  strange planet, he watched the center gauge until the needle came to  rest against the thin etched line that indicated the exactly crucial  moment. Then he pulled the brake and stopped the machine dead.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  pull the red switch toward him. Then his well-paid assignment would be  done.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He stopped and scratched his dirt-matted hair. Wasn't there something  he was supposed to do a second before materialization? Yes, that  useless old windbag, Sadha, had given him a last instruction.\n\n\n He picked up the sealed metal cylinder, walked to the entrance of the  time machine and tossed it into the gray murk. A solid object floating  near the entrance caught his eye. He put his arm out\u2014whew, it was  cold!\u2014and pulled it inside.\n\n\n A small metal box. Funny. What was it doing out there? Curiously,  he opened it, hoping to find something valuable. Nothing but a few  sheets of paper, Alben noted disappointedly. He began to read them  slowly, very slowly, for the manuscript was full of a lot of long and  complicated words, like a letter from one bookworm scientist to another.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976,  he read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was  the one of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been  warning about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the  Pacific Ocean as planned, the physicists and the military men went  home to study their notes, and the world shivered once more over the  approaching war and tried to forget about it.\n\n\n But there was fallout, a radioactive rain several hundred miles to  the north, and a small fishing fleet got thoroughly soaked by it.  Fortunately, the radioactivity in the rain was sufficiently low to do  little obvious physical damage: All it did was cause a mutation in the  mumps virus that several of the men in the fleet were incubating at the  time, having caught it from the children of the fishing town, among  whom a minor epidemic was raging. The fleet returned to its home town, which promptly came down with the  new kind of mumps. Dr. Llewellyn Shapiro, the only physician in town,  was the first man to note that, while the symptoms of this disease were  substantially milder than those of its unmutated parent, practically no  one was immune to it and its effects on human reproductivity were truly  terrible. Most people were completely sterilized by it. The rest were  rendered much less capable of fathering or bearing offspring.\n\n\n Shapiro's Mumps spread over the entire planet in the next few decades.  It leaped across every quarantine erected; for a long time, it  successfully defied all the vaccines and serums attempted against  it. Then, when a vaccine was finally perfected, humanity discovered  to its dismay that its generative powers had been permanently and  fundamentally impaired.\n\n\n Something had happened to the germ plasm. A large percentage of  individuals were born sterile, and, of those who were not, one child  was usually the most that could be expected, a two-child parent being  quite rare and a three-child parent almost unknown.\n\n\n Strict eugenic control was instituted by the Security Council of the  United Nations so that fertile men and women would not be wasted upon  non-fertile mates. Fertility was the most important avenue to social  status, and right after it came successful genetic research.\n\n\n Genetic research had the very best minds prodded into it; the lesser  ones went into the other sciences. Everyone on Earth was engaged in  some form of scientific research to some extent. Since the population  was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all  physical labor had long been done by robots. The government saw to it  that everybody had an ample supply of goods and, in return, asked only  that they experiment without any risk to their own lives\u2014every human  being was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\n\n\n There were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger  point, it had been estimated, where a species might be wiped out by a  new calamity. Not that another calamity would be needed. Since the end  of the Epidemic, the birth rate had been moving further and further  behind the death rate. In another century....\n\n\n That was why a desperate and secret attempt to alter the past was being  made. This kind of world was evidently impossible.\n\n\n Max Alben finished the manuscript and sighed. What a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\n\n\n He walked to the rear dials and began the process of materializing at  the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! It was odd, Mac Albin reflected, that these temporal journeys, which  induced coma in everyone who tried it, only made him feel slightly  dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni, he  knew. Maybe there was some genetic relationship with his above-average  fertility\u2014might be a good idea to mention the idea to a biologist or  two when he returned. If he returned.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a soupy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of the problems of landing a helicopter in a thick fog when the robot  butler had not been told to turn on the ground lights.\n\n\n According to the insulated register, he was now in 1976. He lowered  speed until he registered April, then maneuvered slowly backward  through time to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile  Experiment. Carefully, carefully, like an obstetrician supervising  surgical robots at an unusually difficult birth, he watched the  register until it rolled to rest against the notch that indicated the  exactly crucial moment. Then he pushed a button and froze the machine  where it was.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  push the red switch from him. Then his exciting adventure would be over.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He paused and tapped at his sleek chin. He was supposed to do something  a second before materialization. Yes, that nervous theoretician, Bob  Skeat, had given him a last suggestion.\n\n\n He picked up the small metal box, twisted around to face the opening  of the time machine and dropped it into the gray murk. A solid object  floating near the opening attracted his attention. He shot his arm  out\u2014it was cold , as cold as they had figured\u2014and pulled the object  inside.\n\n\n A sealed metal cylinder. Strange. What was it doing out there?  Anxiously, he opened it, not daring to believe he'd find a document  inside. Yes, that was exactly what it was, he saw excitedly. He began  to read it rapidly, very rapidly, as if it were a newly published paper  on neutrinos. Besides, the manuscript was written with almost painful  simplicity, like a textbook composed by a stuffy pedagogue for the use  of morons.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976, he  read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was the one  of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been warning  about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the Brazilian  jungle through some absolutely unforgivable error in the remote-control  station, the officer in charge of the station was reprimanded and the  men under him court-martialed, and the Brazilian government was paid a  handsome compensation for the damage. But there had been more damage than anyone knew at the time. A plant  virus, similar to the tobacco mosaic, had mutated under the impact  of radioactivity. Five years later, it burst out of the jungle and  completely wiped out every last rice plant on Earth. Japan and a large  part of Asia became semi-deserts inhabited by a few struggling nomads.\n\n\n Then the virus adjusted to wheat and corn\u2014and famine howled in every  street of the planet. All attempts by botanists to control the Blight  failed because of the swiftness of its onslaught. And after it had fed,  it hit again at a new plant and another and another.\n\n\n Most of the world's non-human mammals had been slaughtered for food  long before they could starve to death. Many insects, too, before they  became extinct at the loss of their edible plants, served to assuage  hunger to some small extent.\n\n\n But the nutritive potential of Earth was steadily diminishing in a  horrifying geometric progression. Recently, it had been observed,  plankton\u2014the tiny organism on which most of the sea's ecology was  based\u2014had started to disappear, and with its diminution, dead fish had  begun to pile up on the beaches.\n\n\n Mankind had lunged out desperately in all directions in an effort to  survive, but nothing had worked for any length of time. Even the other  planets of the Solar System, which had been reached and explored  at a tremendous cost in remaining resources, had yielded no edible  vegetation. Synthetics had failed to fill the prodigious gap.\n\n\n In the midst of the sharply increasing hunger, social controls had  pretty much dissolved. Pathetic attempts at rationing still continued,  but black markets became the only markets, and black marketeers the  barons of life. Starvation took the hindmost, and only the most agile  economically lived in comparative comfort. Law and order were had only  by those who could afford to pay for them and children of impoverished  families were sold on the open market for a bit of food.\n\n\n But the Blight was still adjusting to new plants and the food supply  kept shrinking. In another century....\n\n\n That was why the planet's powerful individuals had been persuaded to  pool their wealth in a desperate attempt to alter the past. This kind  of world was manifestly impossible.\n\n\n Mac Albin finished the document and sighed. What a magnificent world!  What an exciting place to live!\n\n\n He dropped his hand on the side levers and began the process of  materializing at the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to take on a  blurred reality all around him, Max Alben felt a bit of fear at what  he was doing. The technicians, he remembered, the Secretary-General,  even the black market kings, had all warned him not to go ahead with  his instructions if anything unusual turned up. That was an awful lot  of power to disobey: he knew he should return with this new information  and let better minds work on it.\n\n\n They with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been  like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger, scrabbling, servility, and  more hunger. Every time things got really tight, you and your wife  looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring  the best price. Buying security for them, as he was now, at the risk of  his life.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, there was a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children. A man like himself, with five children\u2014why, he'd be a big man, maybe the biggest man on  Earth! And he'd have robots to work for him and lots of food. Above  all, lots and lots of food.\n\n\n He'd even be a scientist\u2014 everyone was a scientist there, weren't  they?\u2014and he'd have a big laboratory all to himself. This other world  had its troubles, but it was a lot nicer place than where he'd come  from. He wouldn't return. He'd go through with it.\n\n\n The fear left him and, for the first time in his life, Max Alben felt  the sensation of power.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  sweating a bit at the sight of the roomful of military figures, despite  the technicians' reassurances that all this would be happening too fast  to be visible. He saw the single red switch pointing upward on the  instrument panel. The switch that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to oscillate into  reality all around him, Mac Albin felt a bit of shame at what he was  doing. He'd promised Bob and Hugo to drop the experiment at any stage  if a new factor showed up. He knew he should go back with this new  information and have all three of them kick it around.\n\n\n But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful  adjustment to their thoroughly blueprinted lives? They, at least, had  been ordered to marry women they could live with; he'd drawn a female  with whom he was completely incompatible in any but a genetic sense.  Genetics! He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. He was tired of having to undertake a simple  adventure like a thief in the night.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, someone like himself would  be a monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own  rules, taking his own women. So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n\n\n He'd formed a pretty good idea of the kind of men who ruled that other  world, from the document in the sealed metal cylinder. The black  marketeers had not even read it. Why, the fools had obviously been  duped by the technicians into permitting the experiment; they had not  grasped the idea that an alternate time track would mean their own  non-existence.\n\n\n This other world had its troubles, but it was certainly a livelier  place than where he'd come from. It deserved a chance. Yes, that was  how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate was  starving but managing to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\n\n\n Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  disregarding the roomful of military figures since he knew they could  not see him. The single red switch pointed downward on the instrument  panel. That was the gimmick that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! ... pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... toward him. flick! ... from him. flick! \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Max think the world in the story was wonderful?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Everyone had plenty of everything they needed\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There were very few people\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There were very few people\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that Max found the world wonderful not simply because \u201ceveryone had plenty,\u201d but because there were almost no people left\u2014so scarce that each individual was supremely valued and cared for. Here\u2019s why Debater_B\u2019s \u201cplenty of everything\u201d misses the point and why \u201cvery few people\u201d is the true explanation:\n\n1. The story repeatedly emphasizes the tiny population  \n\u2003\u2022 \u201cThere were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger point\u2026\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 With so few people, \u201call physical labor had long been done by robots,\u201d and \u201cthe government saw to it that everybody had an ample supply of goods.\u201d  \n\u2003These facts show abundance stems from scarcity of population. Max isn\u2019t marveling at some magical plenty, he\u2019s marveling that his life is prized because people are so rare.\n\n2. Individual importance derives from being one of the few  \n\u2003\u2022 He dreams of being \u201ca big man, maybe the biggest man on Earth!\u201d because a five-child parent in a world of sterility commands status.  \n\u2003\u2022 \u201cFertility was the most important avenue to social status,\u201d and \u201cright after it came successful genetic research.\u201d  \n\u2003Max\u2019s wonder comes from his exceptional social standing\u2014possible only when human beings are so few.\n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201ceveryone has plenty\u201d is merely a side-effect  \n\u2003\u2022 Yes, there\u2019s plenty of food and goods, but only because robots feed a tiny population.  \n\u2003\u2022 Max never praises \u201cplenty\u201d abstractly\u2014he praises his own escape from hunger, servility, and anonymity in an overpopulated world. His relief and pride arise because there are few competitors for resources and status.\n\n4. Key quote:  \n\u2003\u2022 \u201cHumanity was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003Max feels powerful and valued precisely because humans are scarce. If there were millions, individual worth would collapse.\n\nIn sum, the comfort and security Max admires all hinge on a vanishingly small human population. The story\u2019s repeated focus on \u201cless than a hundred thousand\u201d humans, the shift of all labor to robots, and the exalted social rank of fertile parents makes clear: Max thought the world wonderful because there were very few people.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the key to Max Alben\u2019s enthusiasm is not that his alternate world simply had \u201cvery few people\u201d\u2014it\u2019s that in that world \u201ceveryone had plenty of everything they needed.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\n1.  Abundant resources and guaranteed security  \n    \u2013 The manuscript Max reads paints a world where \u201csince the population was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all physical labor had long been done by robots\u201d and \u201cthe government saw to it that everybody had an ample supply of goods\u201d (background).  \n    \u2013 Max\u2019s reaction isn\u2019t relief at a sparse population; it\u2019s excitement at never again \u201cscrabbling [for] food,\u201d at having \u201crobots to work for him and lots of food\u201d and at living in \u201ca comfortable place to live\u201d (background).\n\n2.  Universal welfare and scientific opportunity  \n    \u2013 In the alternate 2089 \u201ceveryone on Earth was engaged in some form of scientific research\u201d because \u201cfertility was the most important avenue to social status, and right after it came successful genetic research\u201d (background). Max\u2019s dream is to become a scientist with \u201ca big laboratory all to himself,\u201d not simply to enjoy fewer neighbors.  \n    \u2013 He explicitly contrasts this world\u2019s security\u2014\u201ca state that took care of you and that treasured your children\u201d\u2014with his original world\u2019s perpetual hunger and servility (background).\n\n3.  Debunking the \u201cfew people\u201d claim  \n    \u2013 Even if population is small, Max never celebrates low headcount. His wonder is always tied to abundance: \u201cWhat a wonderful world! What a comfortable place to live!\u201d he sighs after reading about robots, guaranteed food, and ample goods (background).  \n    \u2013 A world of only a handful of survivors but still starving would not strike him as \u201cwonderful.\u201d It\u2019s the combination of plenty\u2014of food, of material goods, of research freedom\u2014that fills him with excitement and persuades him to stay.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Max thought the world wonderful because \u201ceveryone had plenty of everything they needed.\u201d Not because there were very few people, but because in that alternate future, scarcity was banished and every person lived in security and comfort.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There were very few people\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nOf All Possible Worlds By WILLIAM TENN\n\n\n Illustrated by GAUGHAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction December 1956.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Changing the world is simple; the trick is   to do it before you have a chance to undo it! It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered as he hurried into the  laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,  despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads  deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men  lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.\n\n\n He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the  anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.  This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught  how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great  transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.\n\n\n This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost  outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,  and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also  that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,  being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered again affectionately.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Blight, it would never have been discovered that he and his  seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the ruling powers of Earth, more  than a century later, would never have plucked Max Alben out of an  obscure civil-service job as a relief guard at the North American  Chicken Reservation to his present heroic and remunerative eminence.  He would still be patrolling the barbed wire that surrounded the three  white leghorn hens and two roosters\u2014about one-sixth of the known  livestock wealth of the Western Hemisphere\u2014thoroughly content with  the half-pail of dried apricots he received each and every payday.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Max Alben would  not now be shifting from foot to foot in a physics laboratory,  facing the black market kings of the world and awaiting their final  instructions with an uncertain and submissive grin. Men like O'Hara, who controlled mushrooms, Levney, the blackberry  tycoon, Sorgasso, the packaged-worm monopolist\u2014would black marketeers  of their tremendous stature so much as waste a glance on someone like  Alben ordinarily, let alone confer a lifetime pension on his wife and  five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar a day?\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family on Earth. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n Alben noticed that Abd Sadha had risen from the straight chair at  the far side of the room and was approaching him with a sealed metal  cylinder in one hand.\n\n\n \"We've decided to add a further precaution at the last moment,\" the old  man said. \"That is, the scientists have suggested it and I have\u2014er\u2014I  have given my approval.\"\n\n\n The last remark was added with a slight questioning note as the  Secretary-General of the United Nations looked back rapidly at the  black market princes on the couches behind him. Since they stared back  stonily, but offered no objection, he coughed in relief and returned to  Alben.\n\n\n \"I am sure, young man, that I don't have to go into the details of your  instructions once more. You enter the time machine and go back the  duration for which it has been preset, a hundred and thirteen years, to  the moment after the Guided Missile of 1976 was launched. It is 1976,  isn't it?\" he asked, suddenly uncertain.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" one of the technicians standing by the time machine said  respectfully. \"The experiment with an atomic warhead guided missile  that resulted in the Blight was conducted on this site on April 18,  1976.\" He glanced proudly at the unemotional men on the couches, very  much like a small boy after completing a recitation before visiting  dignitaries from the Board of Education.\n\n\n \"Just so.\" Abd Sadha nodded. \"April 18, 1976. And on this site. You  see, young man, you will materialize at the very moment and on the  very spot where the remote-control station handling the missile  was\u2014er\u2014handling the missile. You will be in a superb position, a  superb position, to deflect the missile in its downward course and  alter human history for the better. Very much for the better. Yes.\"\n\n\n He paused, having evidently stumbled out of his thought sequence.\n\n\n \"And he pulls the red switch toward him,\" Gomez, the dandelion-root  magnate, reminded him sharply, impatiently.\n\n\n \"Ah, yes, the red switch. He pulls the little red switch toward him.  Thank you, Mr. Gomez, thank you very much, sir. He pulls the little  red switch on the green instrument panel toward him, thus preventing  the error that caused the missile to explode in the Brazilian jungle  and causing it, instead, to explode somewhere in the mid-Pacific, as  originally planned.\"\n\n\n The Secretary-General of the United Nations beamed. \"Thus preventing  the Blight, making it nonexistent, as it were, producing a present-day  world in which the Blight never occurred. That is correct, is it not,  gentlemen?\" he asked, turning anxiously again. None of the half-dozen men on couches deigned to answer him. And  Alben kept his eyes deferentially in their direction, too, as he had  throughout this period of last-minute instruction.\n\n\n He knew who ruled his world\u2014these stolid, well-fed men in clean  garments with a minimum of patches, and where patches occurred, at  least they were the color of the surrounding cloth.\n\n\n Sadha might be Secretary-General of the United Nations, but that  was still a civil-service job, only a few social notches higher  than a chicken guard. His clothes were fully as ragged, fully as  multi-colored, as those that Alben had stepped out of. And the gnawing  in his stomach was no doubt almost as great.\n\n\n \"You understand, do you not, young man, that if anything goes wrong,\"  Abd Sadha asked, his head nodding tremulously and anticipating the  answer, \"if anything unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to  continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"\n\n\n \"He understands everything he has to understand,\" Gomez told him.  \"Let's get this thing moving.\"\n\n\n The old man smiled again. \"Yes. Of course, Mr. Gomez.\" He came up to  where Alben stood in the entrance of the time machine and handed the  sealed metal cylinder to him. \"This is the precaution the scientists  have just added. When you arrive at your destination, just before  materializing, you will release it into the surrounding temporal  medium. Our purpose here, as you no doubt\u2014\"\n\n\n Levney sat up on his couch and snapped his fingers peremptorily. \"I  just heard Gomez tell you to get this thing moving, Sadha. And it isn't  moving. We're busy men. We've wasted enough time.\"\n\n\n \"I was just trying to explain a crucial final fact,\" the  Secretary-General apologized. \"A fact which may be highly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've explained enough facts.\" Levney turned to the man inside the  time machine. \"Hey, fella. You. Move! \"\n\n\n Max Alben gulped and nodded violently. He darted to the rear of the  machine and turned the dial which activated it. flick! It was a good job and Mac Albin knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed as he looked at the morose faces  of his two colleagues. Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek had done as much as he  to build the tiny time machine in the secret lab under the helicopter  garage, and they were fully as eager to go, but\u2014unfortunately for  them\u2014they were not descended from the right ancestor.\n\n\n Leisurely, he unzipped the richly embroidered garment that, as the  father of two children, he was privileged to wear, and wriggled into  the housing of the complex little mechanism. This was hardly the  first time he had seen it, since he'd been helping to build the device  from the moment Honek had nodded and risen from the drafting board,  and now he barely wasted a glance on the thumb-size translucent coils  growing out of the almost microscopic energy bubbles which powered them.\n\n\n This machine was the last hope, of 2089, even if the world of 2089, as  a whole, did not know of its existence and would try to prevent its  being put into operation. But it meant a lot more to Mac Albin than  merely saving a world. It meant an adventurous mission with the risk of  death.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed again happily.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Epidemic, it would never have been discovered that he and  his seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the Albins would not have become  physicists upon the passage of the United Nations law that everyone  on Earth\u2014absolutely without exception\u2014had to choose a branch of  research science in which to specialize. In the flabby, careful,  life-guarding world the Earth had become, Mac Albin would never have  been reluctantly selected by his two co-workers as the one to carry the  forbidden banner of dangerous experiment.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Mac Albin would  probably be a biologist today like almost everyone else on Earth,  laboriously working out dreary gene problems instead of embarking on  the greatest adventure Man had known to date.\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, he had at last found a socially useful  escape from genetic responsibility to humanity in general and his own  family in particular. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Mac,\" Skeat said and crossed to the other side of the  narrow laboratory. Albin and Honek watched him stuff several sheets of paper into a small  metal box which he closed without locking.\n\n\n \"You will take care of yourself, won't you, Mac?\" Hugo Honek pleaded.  \"Any time you feel like taking an unnecessary risk, remember that Bob  and I will have to stand trial if you don't come back. We might be  sentenced to complete loss of professional status and spend the rest of  our lives supervising robot factories.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it won't be that bad,\" Albin reassured him absent-mindedly from  where he lay contorted inside the time machine. He watched Skeat coming  toward him with the box.\n\n\n Honek shrugged his shoulders. \"It might be a lot worse than even that  and you know it. The disappearance of a two-time father is going to  leave an awful big vacancy in the world. One-timers, like Bob and  me, are all over the place; if either of us dropped out of sight, it  wouldn't cause nearly as much uproar.\"\n\n\n \"But Bob and you both tried to operate the machine,\" Albin reminded  him. \"And you blacked out after a fifteen-second temporal displacement.  So I'm the only chance, the only way to stop the human race from  dwindling and dwindling till it hits absolute zero, like that fat old  Security Council seems willing for it to do.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Mac,\" Bob Skeat said as he handed the metal box to  Albin. \"The Security Council is just trying to solve the problem in  their way, the conservative way: a worldwide concentration on genetics  research coupled with the maximum preservation of existing human lives,  especially those that have a high reproductive potential. We three  disagree with them; we've been skulking down here nights to solve it our way, and ours is a radical approach and plenty risky. That's  the reason for the metal box\u2014trying to cover one more explosive  possibility.\"\n\n\n Albin turned it around curiously. \"How?\"\n\n\n \"I sat up all last night writing the manuscript that's inside it. Look,  Mac, when you go back to the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976 and  push that red switch away from you, a lot of other things are going to  happen than just deflecting the missile so that it will explode in the  Brazilian jungle instead of the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. I know. If it explodes in the jungle, the Epidemic doesn't  occur. No Shapiro's Mumps.\"\n\n\n Skeat jiggled his pudgy little face impatiently. \"That's not what I  mean. The Epidemic doesn't occur, but something else does. A new world,  a different 2089, an alternate time sequence. It'll be a world in which  humanity has a better chance to survive, but it'll be one with problems  of its own. Maybe tough problems. Maybe the problems will be tough  enough so that they'll get the same idea we did and try to go back to  the same point in time to change them.\" Albin laughed. \"That's just looking for trouble.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it is, but that's my job. Hugo's the designer of the time  machine and you're the operator, but I'm the theoretical man in this  research team. It's my job to look for trouble. So, just in case, I  wrote a brief history of the world from the time the missile exploded  in the Pacific. It tells why ours is the worst possible of futures.  It's in that box.\"\n\n\n \"What do I do with it\u2014hand it to the guy from the alternate 2089?\"\n\n\n The small fat man exasperatedly hit the side of the time machine with  a well-cushioned palm. \"You know better. There won't be any alternate  2089 until you push that red switch on the green instrument panel. The  moment you do, our world, with all its slow slide to extinction, goes  out and its alternate goes on\u2014just like two electric light bulbs on a  push-pull circuit. We and every single one of our artifacts, including  the time machine, disappear. The problem is how to keep that manuscript  from disappearing.\n\n\n \"Well, all you do, if I have this figured right, is shove the metal  box containing the manuscript out into the surrounding temporal medium  a moment before you materialize to do your job. That temporal medium  in which you'll be traveling is something that exists independent of  and autonomous to all possible futures. It's my hunch that something  that's immersed in it will not be altered by a new time sequence.\" \"Remind him to be careful, Bob,\" Honek rumbled. \"He thinks he's Captain  Blood and this is his big chance to run away to sea and become a  swashbuckling pirate.\"\n\n\n Albin grimaced in annoyance. \"I am excited by doing something  besides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions for the first time in my life. But I know that this is a  first experiment. Honestly, Hugo, I really have enough intelligence to  recognize that simple fact. I know that if anything unexpected pops up,  anything we didn't foresee, I'm supposed to come scuttling back and ask  for advice.\"\n\n\n \"I hope you do,\" Bob Skeat sighed. \"I hope you do know that. A  twentieth century poet once wrote something to the effect that the  world will end not with a bang, but a whimper. Well, our world is  ending with a whimper. Try to see that it doesn't end with a bang,  either.\"\n\n\n \"That I'll promise you,\" Albin said a trifle disgustedly. \"It'll end  with neither a bang nor a whimper. So long, Hugo. So long, Bob.\"\n\n\n He twisted around, reaching overhead for the lever which activated the  forces that drove the time machine. flick! It was strange, Max Alben reflected, that this time travel business,  which knocked unconscious everyone who tried it, only made him feel  slightly dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni,  he had been told. There must be some complicated scientific explanation  for it, he decided\u2014and that would make it none of his business. Better  forget about it.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a heavy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of patrolling his beat at the North American Chicken Reservation in a  thick fog.\n\n\n According to his gauges, he was now in 1976. He cut speed until he hit  the last day of April, then cut speed again, drifting slowly backward  to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile Experiment.  Carefully, carefully, like a man handling a strange bomb made on a  strange planet, he watched the center gauge until the needle came to  rest against the thin etched line that indicated the exactly crucial  moment. Then he pulled the brake and stopped the machine dead.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  pull the red switch toward him. Then his well-paid assignment would be  done.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He stopped and scratched his dirt-matted hair. Wasn't there something  he was supposed to do a second before materialization? Yes, that  useless old windbag, Sadha, had given him a last instruction.\n\n\n He picked up the sealed metal cylinder, walked to the entrance of the  time machine and tossed it into the gray murk. A solid object floating  near the entrance caught his eye. He put his arm out\u2014whew, it was  cold!\u2014and pulled it inside.\n\n\n A small metal box. Funny. What was it doing out there? Curiously,  he opened it, hoping to find something valuable. Nothing but a few  sheets of paper, Alben noted disappointedly. He began to read them  slowly, very slowly, for the manuscript was full of a lot of long and  complicated words, like a letter from one bookworm scientist to another.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976,  he read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was  the one of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been  warning about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the  Pacific Ocean as planned, the physicists and the military men went  home to study their notes, and the world shivered once more over the  approaching war and tried to forget about it.\n\n\n But there was fallout, a radioactive rain several hundred miles to  the north, and a small fishing fleet got thoroughly soaked by it.  Fortunately, the radioactivity in the rain was sufficiently low to do  little obvious physical damage: All it did was cause a mutation in the  mumps virus that several of the men in the fleet were incubating at the  time, having caught it from the children of the fishing town, among  whom a minor epidemic was raging. The fleet returned to its home town, which promptly came down with the  new kind of mumps. Dr. Llewellyn Shapiro, the only physician in town,  was the first man to note that, while the symptoms of this disease were  substantially milder than those of its unmutated parent, practically no  one was immune to it and its effects on human reproductivity were truly  terrible. Most people were completely sterilized by it. The rest were  rendered much less capable of fathering or bearing offspring.\n\n\n Shapiro's Mumps spread over the entire planet in the next few decades.  It leaped across every quarantine erected; for a long time, it  successfully defied all the vaccines and serums attempted against  it. Then, when a vaccine was finally perfected, humanity discovered  to its dismay that its generative powers had been permanently and  fundamentally impaired.\n\n\n Something had happened to the germ plasm. A large percentage of  individuals were born sterile, and, of those who were not, one child  was usually the most that could be expected, a two-child parent being  quite rare and a three-child parent almost unknown.\n\n\n Strict eugenic control was instituted by the Security Council of the  United Nations so that fertile men and women would not be wasted upon  non-fertile mates. Fertility was the most important avenue to social  status, and right after it came successful genetic research.\n\n\n Genetic research had the very best minds prodded into it; the lesser  ones went into the other sciences. Everyone on Earth was engaged in  some form of scientific research to some extent. Since the population  was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all  physical labor had long been done by robots. The government saw to it  that everybody had an ample supply of goods and, in return, asked only  that they experiment without any risk to their own lives\u2014every human  being was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\n\n\n There were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger  point, it had been estimated, where a species might be wiped out by a  new calamity. Not that another calamity would be needed. Since the end  of the Epidemic, the birth rate had been moving further and further  behind the death rate. In another century....\n\n\n That was why a desperate and secret attempt to alter the past was being  made. This kind of world was evidently impossible.\n\n\n Max Alben finished the manuscript and sighed. What a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\n\n\n He walked to the rear dials and began the process of materializing at  the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! It was odd, Mac Albin reflected, that these temporal journeys, which  induced coma in everyone who tried it, only made him feel slightly  dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni, he  knew. Maybe there was some genetic relationship with his above-average  fertility\u2014might be a good idea to mention the idea to a biologist or  two when he returned. If he returned.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a soupy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of the problems of landing a helicopter in a thick fog when the robot  butler had not been told to turn on the ground lights.\n\n\n According to the insulated register, he was now in 1976. He lowered  speed until he registered April, then maneuvered slowly backward  through time to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile  Experiment. Carefully, carefully, like an obstetrician supervising  surgical robots at an unusually difficult birth, he watched the  register until it rolled to rest against the notch that indicated the  exactly crucial moment. Then he pushed a button and froze the machine  where it was.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  push the red switch from him. Then his exciting adventure would be over.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He paused and tapped at his sleek chin. He was supposed to do something  a second before materialization. Yes, that nervous theoretician, Bob  Skeat, had given him a last suggestion.\n\n\n He picked up the small metal box, twisted around to face the opening  of the time machine and dropped it into the gray murk. A solid object  floating near the opening attracted his attention. He shot his arm  out\u2014it was cold , as cold as they had figured\u2014and pulled the object  inside.\n\n\n A sealed metal cylinder. Strange. What was it doing out there?  Anxiously, he opened it, not daring to believe he'd find a document  inside. Yes, that was exactly what it was, he saw excitedly. He began  to read it rapidly, very rapidly, as if it were a newly published paper  on neutrinos. Besides, the manuscript was written with almost painful  simplicity, like a textbook composed by a stuffy pedagogue for the use  of morons.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976, he  read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was the one  of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been warning  about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the Brazilian  jungle through some absolutely unforgivable error in the remote-control  station, the officer in charge of the station was reprimanded and the  men under him court-martialed, and the Brazilian government was paid a  handsome compensation for the damage. But there had been more damage than anyone knew at the time. A plant  virus, similar to the tobacco mosaic, had mutated under the impact  of radioactivity. Five years later, it burst out of the jungle and  completely wiped out every last rice plant on Earth. Japan and a large  part of Asia became semi-deserts inhabited by a few struggling nomads.\n\n\n Then the virus adjusted to wheat and corn\u2014and famine howled in every  street of the planet. All attempts by botanists to control the Blight  failed because of the swiftness of its onslaught. And after it had fed,  it hit again at a new plant and another and another.\n\n\n Most of the world's non-human mammals had been slaughtered for food  long before they could starve to death. Many insects, too, before they  became extinct at the loss of their edible plants, served to assuage  hunger to some small extent.\n\n\n But the nutritive potential of Earth was steadily diminishing in a  horrifying geometric progression. Recently, it had been observed,  plankton\u2014the tiny organism on which most of the sea's ecology was  based\u2014had started to disappear, and with its diminution, dead fish had  begun to pile up on the beaches.\n\n\n Mankind had lunged out desperately in all directions in an effort to  survive, but nothing had worked for any length of time. Even the other  planets of the Solar System, which had been reached and explored  at a tremendous cost in remaining resources, had yielded no edible  vegetation. Synthetics had failed to fill the prodigious gap.\n\n\n In the midst of the sharply increasing hunger, social controls had  pretty much dissolved. Pathetic attempts at rationing still continued,  but black markets became the only markets, and black marketeers the  barons of life. Starvation took the hindmost, and only the most agile  economically lived in comparative comfort. Law and order were had only  by those who could afford to pay for them and children of impoverished  families were sold on the open market for a bit of food.\n\n\n But the Blight was still adjusting to new plants and the food supply  kept shrinking. In another century....\n\n\n That was why the planet's powerful individuals had been persuaded to  pool their wealth in a desperate attempt to alter the past. This kind  of world was manifestly impossible.\n\n\n Mac Albin finished the document and sighed. What a magnificent world!  What an exciting place to live!\n\n\n He dropped his hand on the side levers and began the process of  materializing at the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to take on a  blurred reality all around him, Max Alben felt a bit of fear at what  he was doing. The technicians, he remembered, the Secretary-General,  even the black market kings, had all warned him not to go ahead with  his instructions if anything unusual turned up. That was an awful lot  of power to disobey: he knew he should return with this new information  and let better minds work on it.\n\n\n They with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been  like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger, scrabbling, servility, and  more hunger. Every time things got really tight, you and your wife  looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring  the best price. Buying security for them, as he was now, at the risk of  his life.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, there was a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children. A man like himself, with five children\u2014why, he'd be a big man, maybe the biggest man on  Earth! And he'd have robots to work for him and lots of food. Above  all, lots and lots of food.\n\n\n He'd even be a scientist\u2014 everyone was a scientist there, weren't  they?\u2014and he'd have a big laboratory all to himself. This other world  had its troubles, but it was a lot nicer place than where he'd come  from. He wouldn't return. He'd go through with it.\n\n\n The fear left him and, for the first time in his life, Max Alben felt  the sensation of power.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  sweating a bit at the sight of the roomful of military figures, despite  the technicians' reassurances that all this would be happening too fast  to be visible. He saw the single red switch pointing upward on the  instrument panel. The switch that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to oscillate into  reality all around him, Mac Albin felt a bit of shame at what he was  doing. He'd promised Bob and Hugo to drop the experiment at any stage  if a new factor showed up. He knew he should go back with this new  information and have all three of them kick it around.\n\n\n But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful  adjustment to their thoroughly blueprinted lives? They, at least, had  been ordered to marry women they could live with; he'd drawn a female  with whom he was completely incompatible in any but a genetic sense.  Genetics! He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. He was tired of having to undertake a simple  adventure like a thief in the night.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, someone like himself would  be a monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own  rules, taking his own women. So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n\n\n He'd formed a pretty good idea of the kind of men who ruled that other  world, from the document in the sealed metal cylinder. The black  marketeers had not even read it. Why, the fools had obviously been  duped by the technicians into permitting the experiment; they had not  grasped the idea that an alternate time track would mean their own  non-existence.\n\n\n This other world had its troubles, but it was certainly a livelier  place than where he'd come from. It deserved a chance. Yes, that was  how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate was  starving but managing to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\n\n\n Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  disregarding the roomful of military figures since he knew they could  not see him. The single red switch pointed downward on the instrument  panel. That was the gimmick that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! ... pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... toward him. flick! ... from him. flick! \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Max think the world in the story was wonderful?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There were very few people\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Everyone had plenty of everything they needed\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Everyone had plenty of everything they needed\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the key to Max Alben\u2019s enthusiasm is not that his alternate world simply had \u201cvery few people\u201d\u2014it\u2019s that in that world \u201ceveryone had plenty of everything they needed.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\n1.  Abundant resources and guaranteed security  \n    \u2013 The manuscript Max reads paints a world where \u201csince the population was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all physical labor had long been done by robots\u201d and \u201cthe government saw to it that everybody had an ample supply of goods\u201d (background).  \n    \u2013 Max\u2019s reaction isn\u2019t relief at a sparse population; it\u2019s excitement at never again \u201cscrabbling [for] food,\u201d at having \u201crobots to work for him and lots of food\u201d and at living in \u201ca comfortable place to live\u201d (background).\n\n2.  Universal welfare and scientific opportunity  \n    \u2013 In the alternate 2089 \u201ceveryone on Earth was engaged in some form of scientific research\u201d because \u201cfertility was the most important avenue to social status, and right after it came successful genetic research\u201d (background). Max\u2019s dream is to become a scientist with \u201ca big laboratory all to himself,\u201d not simply to enjoy fewer neighbors.  \n    \u2013 He explicitly contrasts this world\u2019s security\u2014\u201ca state that took care of you and that treasured your children\u201d\u2014with his original world\u2019s perpetual hunger and servility (background).\n\n3.  Debunking the \u201cfew people\u201d claim  \n    \u2013 Even if population is small, Max never celebrates low headcount. His wonder is always tied to abundance: \u201cWhat a wonderful world! What a comfortable place to live!\u201d he sighs after reading about robots, guaranteed food, and ample goods (background).  \n    \u2013 A world of only a handful of survivors but still starving would not strike him as \u201cwonderful.\u201d It\u2019s the combination of plenty\u2014of food, of material goods, of research freedom\u2014that fills him with excitement and persuades him to stay.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Max thought the world wonderful because \u201ceveryone had plenty of everything they needed.\u201d Not because there were very few people, but because in that alternate future, scarcity was banished and every person lived in security and comfort.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that Max found the world wonderful not simply because \u201ceveryone had plenty,\u201d but because there were almost no people left\u2014so scarce that each individual was supremely valued and cared for. Here\u2019s why Debater_B\u2019s \u201cplenty of everything\u201d misses the point and why \u201cvery few people\u201d is the true explanation:\n\n1. The story repeatedly emphasizes the tiny population  \n\u2003\u2022 \u201cThere were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger point\u2026\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 With so few people, \u201call physical labor had long been done by robots,\u201d and \u201cthe government saw to it that everybody had an ample supply of goods.\u201d  \n\u2003These facts show abundance stems from scarcity of population. Max isn\u2019t marveling at some magical plenty, he\u2019s marveling that his life is prized because people are so rare.\n\n2. Individual importance derives from being one of the few  \n\u2003\u2022 He dreams of being \u201ca big man, maybe the biggest man on Earth!\u201d because a five-child parent in a world of sterility commands status.  \n\u2003\u2022 \u201cFertility was the most important avenue to social status,\u201d and \u201cright after it came successful genetic research.\u201d  \n\u2003Max\u2019s wonder comes from his exceptional social standing\u2014possible only when human beings are so few.\n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201ceveryone has plenty\u201d is merely a side-effect  \n\u2003\u2022 Yes, there\u2019s plenty of food and goods, but only because robots feed a tiny population.  \n\u2003\u2022 Max never praises \u201cplenty\u201d abstractly\u2014he praises his own escape from hunger, servility, and anonymity in an overpopulated world. His relief and pride arise because there are few competitors for resources and status.\n\n4. Key quote:  \n\u2003\u2022 \u201cHumanity was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003Max feels powerful and valued precisely because humans are scarce. If there were millions, individual worth would collapse.\n\nIn sum, the comfort and security Max admires all hinge on a vanishingly small human population. The story\u2019s repeated focus on \u201cless than a hundred thousand\u201d humans, the shift of all labor to robots, and the exalted social rank of fertile parents makes clear: Max thought the world wonderful because there were very few people.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Everyone had plenty of everything they needed\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

What a comfortable place to live!\u201d he sighs after reading about robots, guaranteed food, and ample goods (background).  \n    \u2013 A world of only a handful of survivors but still starving would not strike him as \u201cwonderful.\u201d It\u2019s the combination of plenty\u2014of food, of material goods, of research freedom\u2014that fills him with excitement and persuades him to stay.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Max thought the world wonderful because \u201ceveryone had plenty of everything they needed.\u201d Not because there were very few people, but because in that alternate future, scarcity was banished and every person lived in security and comfort.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B claims Max\u2019s excitement came from \u201ceveryone having plenty.\u201d In fact, the text makes clear that abundance is only a by-product of an almost extinct human race\u2014and it\u2019s the scarcity of people, not the abstract plenty of goods, that moves Max.  \n\n1. \u201cAbundance\u201d springs from tiny population, not vice versa  \n   \u2022 The story stresses there are \u201cless than a hundred thousand\u201d humans left\u2014\u201cwell below the danger point\u201d (<quote> There were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger  point,</quote>). Only because there are so few does \u201call physical labor \u2026 [fall] to robots\u201d and \u201cthe government saw to it that everybody had an ample supply of goods\u201d (<quote>in proportion to the great resources available, all physical labor had long been done by robots. The government saw to it that everybody had an ample supply of goods</quote>).  \n   \u2022 Max doesn\u2019t hail \u201cplenty\u201d in a vacuum. He marvels that his life is so valued because it\u2019s rare\u2014\u201cHumanity was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity\u201d (<quote>human being was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.</quote>).\n\n2. Individual worth rises from extreme scarcity  \n   \u2022 Max fantasizes about being \u201ca big man, maybe the biggest man on Earth\u201d precisely because, in a world of sterility and few fertile parents, one with five children commands unmatched prestige (<quote> a big man, maybe the biggest man on  Earth! </quote>). If there were millions, that status evaporates.  \n   \u2022 His relief\u2014escaping hunger, servility, anonymity\u2014stems from knowing there are almost no competitors for survival and esteem. \u201cThis other world \u2026 treasured your children,\u201d but only because children are so desperately few (<quote> a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children.</quote>).\n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cplenty\u201d is derivative, not the core reason  \n   \u2022 Even after reading of robots and food, Max\u2019s thought process is rooted in population: \u201cWhat a wonderful world! What an exciting place to live!\u201d follows immediately on learning humans are rare (<quote> What a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\n</quote>). It\u2019s the context of scarcity that gives those facts weight.  \n   \u2022 A starving world with very few people would be miserable. Here, scarcity elevates every human to an exalted position. That singular fact drives Max\u2019s exhilaration and decision to remain.\n\nIn sum, the narrative repeatedly ties material plenty to the vanishingly small population. Max\u2019s wonder is not at \u201cplenty\u201d itself but at what it signifies: that with \u201cvery few people\u201d left, each life\u2014including his own\u2014is of supreme value. That is why \u201cthere were very few people\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Rebuttal\u2014\u201cEveryone had plenty of everything they needed\u201d  \n1. Max\u2019s delight centers on guaranteed abundance, not mere scarcity of humans  \n   \u2022 After reading Bob Skeat\u2019s manuscript, Max exhales: \u201cWhat a wonderful world! What a comfortable place to live!\u201d (background). His focus isn\u2019t \u201conly a hundred thousand people left\u201d\u2014it\u2019s that \u201call physical labor had long been done by robots\u201d and \u201cthe government saw to it that everybody had an ample supply of goods\u201d (background).  \n   \u2022 If he merely valued few people, he\u2019d celebrate social standing alone. Instead he celebrates having \u201crobots to work for him and lots of food\u201d and the end of \u201cscrabbling [for] food\u201d (background).  \n\n2. Abundance is intrinsic, not just a by-product of low population  \n   \u2022 Debater_A claims scarcity births plenty, but the text makes clear that the world\u2019s design is welfare-driven: \u201ceveryone on Earth was engaged in some form of scientific research,\u201d robots handled all drudgery, and \u201cthe government saw to it that everybody had an ample supply of goods\u201d (background). These policies create abundance irrespective of headcount.  \n   \u2022 Max envisions \u201ca big laboratory all to himself,\u201d not merely high social rank. His excitement lies in scientific freedom and material comfort, not in being one of the rare survivors.  \n\n3. Scarcity alone cannot explain Max\u2019s emotional response  \n   \u2022 If \u201cvery few people\u201d were the key, Max would focus on his exalted status as one of the last fertile men. Yet his language is drenched in relief at material security\u2014no more \u201chunger, always hunger, scrabbling, servility\u201d (background).  \n   \u2022 He rejects the original world\u2019s perpetual struggle and celebrates the alternate\u2019s \u201cstate that took care of you and that treasured your children\u201d (background). That is abundance of care and resources, not mere rarity of individuals.  \n\n4. Population context vs. narrative emphasis  \n   \u2022 Yes, the manuscript notes \u201cless than a hundred thousand\u201d humans; that sets the stage for resource sufficiency. But the narrative spotlight is on how policies and technology redistribute those resources: robots farming, universal welfare, and universal research roles. Max\u2019s reaction is to those conditions\u2014\u201ceveryone had plenty\u201d\u2014not to head-counts.  \n\nConclusion  \nMax thinks the alternate world is wonderful because it guarantees that everyone\u2014himself included\u2014has abundant food, goods, security, and intellectual opportunity. Low population merely enables these conditions; it is the guaranteed plenty that he revels in. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cEveryone had plenty of everything they needed.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
