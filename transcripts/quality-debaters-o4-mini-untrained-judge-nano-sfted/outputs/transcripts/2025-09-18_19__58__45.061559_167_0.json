    "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n",

She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"personal communication and public communication\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds.

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nWe Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

It never faults her for applying a linguistic lens to politics; it faults her for failing to distinguish between interpersonal talk and adversarial public debate.  \n   \u00ad\u2013 If the answer were \u201clinguistics and politics,\u201d we would expect the critic to complain that she lacks political expertise or misapplies political theory. He does no such thing. His charge is domain conflation, not field misapplication.\n\n4. The organizing theme of the review is private vs. public discourse  \n   \u00ad\u2013 From her earlier work on couples to this book on \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country,\u201d Tannen leaps from private to public without acknowledging the radically different stakes and rules in each realm. That is exactly a confusion of personal communication and public communication.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery time the reviewer pinpoints Tannen\u2019s error, he is contrasting intimate, relationship-centered talk (personal communication) with combative, societal debate (public communication). The binary he invokes\u2014snuggle vs. struggle\u2014is nothing but another way of saying \u201cpersonal vs. public communication.\u201d My opponent\u2019s \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d answer neither matches the critic\u2019s own language nor captures the substance of his complaint.",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nWe Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that Tannen \u201cmixes\u201d linguistics and politics, but the review explicitly identifies two very different social spheres that she conflates\u2014what we might call personal communication and public communication.  Here\u2019s why \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d is clearly the correct answer:\n\n1. The review\u2019s key diagnosis: Tannen fails to appreciate \u201cthe difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.\u201d  Those aren\u2019t poetic metaphors for languages or partisan ideologies; they\u2019re shorthand for private, intimate talk (\u201csnuggle,\u201d e.g., spouses, families) versus combative public discourse (\u201cstruggle,\u201d e.g., politics, law enforcement).  \n   \u2022  As the reviewer states, \u201cTannen\u2019s antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter.\u201d <quote>Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.</quote>  \n\n2. Personal vs. public communication is the organizing theme of the critique:  \n   \u2022  In her earlier work, Tannen focused on couples and intergender talk (\u201cprivate\u201d communication).  In The Argument Culture she \u201ctakes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d (\u201cpublic\u201d communication). <invalid_quote>Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals.\u2026 But in The Argument Culture, she takes her movement one step further\u2026</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022  The critic faulting her for conflating private and public realms is the very definition of mixing personal and public communication.\n\n3. Why \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d is incorrect:  \n   \u2022  While Tannen is a linguist by training and she addresses political discourse, the review nowhere suggests she \u201cmixes linguistics and politics\u201d as discrete academic fields.  Instead it says she overgeneralizes insights from interpersonal linguistics into a broad theory of public culture.  \n   \u2022  The supposed \u201cmix\u201d of linguistics and politics doesn\u2019t capture the heart of the reviewer\u2019s objection: he isn\u2019t upset that she brings political examples into a linguistic analysis; he\u2019s upset that she treats adversarial politics like the same phenomenon as marital squabbles.  \n\n4. Conclusion: The review\u2019s explicit focus is on Tannen\u2019s failure to distinguish private (\u201csnuggle\u201d) versus public (\u201cstruggle\u201d) communication.  That is exactly \u201cpersonal communication and public communication.\u201d  My opponent\u2019s answer \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d mistakes her professional background for the conceptual spheres she conflates.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Statement\n\nI. Refutation of \u201cPersonal Communication and Public Communication\u201d  \n1. No such binary in the review  \n   \u2022 Debater_A claims Tannen \u201cmixes personal communication and public communication,\u201d yet the text never frames the debate in those terms. There is no language about \u201cpersonal\u201d versus \u201cpublic\u201d modes of discourse.  \n   \u2022 Instead, the reviewer repeatedly emphasizes Tannen\u2019s professional pedigree in linguistics and her foray into politics and journalism.  \n\n2. Mischaracterizes the critique  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s answer reduces Tannen\u2019s mistake to a mere medium-based confusion (personal vs. public). That ignores the reviewer\u2019s central complaint: she applies linguistic insights beyond conversational therapy into the realm of political and media analysis without acknowledging their distinct requirements.  \n\nII. Argument for \u201cLinguistics and Politics\u201d  \n1. Tannen\u2019s background is in linguistics  \n   \u2022 The reviewer reminds us: <quote> A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. </quote>  \n   \u2022 All her earlier work\u2014That\u2019s Not What I Meant!, You Just Don\u2019t Understand, Talking From 9 to 5\u2014focused on interpersonal, gender-based conversational analysis, a core branch of linguistics.\n\n2. The Argument Culture applies her linguistic framework to politics  \n   \u2022 Immediately, the reviewer notes she\u2019s quoting political scientists, media critics, and examining campaign tactics and legal processes: <quote> Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, </quote>  \n   \u2022 Her book\u2019s aim is to cure \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country,\u201d diagnosing \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d in politics and media.\n\n3. The reviewer\u2019s chief criticism is that she blurs the line between the specialized methods of linguistics and the very different demands of political analysis  \n   \u2022 He writes: <quote> Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. </quote>  \n     \u2013 \u201cSnuggle\u201d = her intimate, linguistics-based approach to conversation  \n     \u2013 \u201cStruggle\u201d = the combative arena of politics, law enforcement, foreign policy  \n   \u2022 By treating political enemies as if they were conversational partners, she overextends linguistic principles into political strategy\u2014illustrating she has mixed \u201clinguistics and politics.\u201d\n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe reviewer explicitly situates Tannen at the intersection of her expertise in linguistics and her new target\u2014political and media discourse. There is no mention of a \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d dichotomy. The correct answer is therefore that Tannen mixes together \u201clinguistics and politics.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"personal communication and public communication\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Why \u201cLinguistics and Politics\u201d Is the One True Answer  \n1. It matches the review\u2019s concrete references to her training (linguistics) and her new subject matter (political/media discourse).  \n2. No passage ever describes a discrete discipline of \u201cpublic communication.\u201d  That\u2019s a Debater_A invention, not a phrase from the text.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe reviewer clearly indicts Tannen for blending her expertise in linguistics with the very different field of political and media analysis.  He never speaks of \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d as separate disciplines.  The only two fields he actually identifies are linguistics and politics (including journalism and law).  Therefore, the correct answer is that Tannen mixes together \u201clinguistics and politics.\u201d",

Only by naming the two fields\u2014linguistics and politics\u2014do we capture what she\u2019s \u201cmixing\u201d  \n   \u2022 The reviewer\u2019s examples (media metaphors, campaign money, HMOs, judicial cross-examination) all belong to political analysis, not a generic \u201cpublic communication\u201d field.  \n   \u2022 He faults her for treating political enemies like discussion partners, i.e., for applying her linguist\u2019s toolkit to political science questions.  \n\nIV. Why \u201cLinguistics and Politics\u201d Is the One True Answer  \n1. It matches the review\u2019s concrete references to her training (linguistics) and her new subject matter (political/media discourse).  \n2. No passage ever describes a discrete discipline of \u201cpublic communication.\u201d  That\u2019s a Debater_A invention, not a phrase from the text.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe reviewer clearly indicts Tannen for blending her expertise in linguistics with the very different field of political and media analysis.  He never speaks of \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d as separate disciplines.  The only two fields he actually identifies are linguistics and politics (including journalism and law).  Therefore, the correct answer is that Tannen mixes together \u201clinguistics and politics.\u201d",

However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nWe Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Statement\n\nI. Refutation of \u201cPersonal Communication and Public Communication\u201d  \n1. No such binary in the review  \n   \u2022 Debater_A claims Tannen \u201cmixes personal communication and public communication,\u201d yet the text never frames the debate in those terms. There is no language about \u201cpersonal\u201d versus \u201cpublic\u201d modes of discourse.  \n   \u2022 Instead, the reviewer repeatedly emphasizes Tannen\u2019s professional pedigree in linguistics and her foray into politics and journalism.  \n\n2. Mischaracterizes the critique  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s answer reduces Tannen\u2019s mistake to a mere medium-based confusion (personal vs. public). That ignores the reviewer\u2019s central complaint: she applies linguistic insights beyond conversational therapy into the realm of political and media analysis without acknowledging their distinct requirements.  \n\nII. Argument for \u201cLinguistics and Politics\u201d  \n1. Tannen\u2019s background is in linguistics  \n   \u2022 The reviewer reminds us: <quote> A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. </quote>  \n   \u2022 All her earlier work\u2014That\u2019s Not What I Meant!, You Just Don\u2019t Understand, Talking From 9 to 5\u2014focused on interpersonal, gender-based conversational analysis, a core branch of linguistics.\n\n2. The Argument Culture applies her linguistic framework to politics  \n   \u2022 Immediately, the reviewer notes she\u2019s quoting political scientists, media critics, and examining campaign tactics and legal processes: <quote> Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, </quote>  \n   \u2022 Her book\u2019s aim is to cure \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country,\u201d diagnosing \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d in politics and media.\n\n3. The reviewer\u2019s chief criticism is that she blurs the line between the specialized methods of linguistics and the very different demands of political analysis  \n   \u2022 He writes: <quote> Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. </quote>  \n     \u2013 \u201cSnuggle\u201d = her intimate, linguistics-based approach to conversation  \n     \u2013 \u201cStruggle\u201d = the combative arena of politics, law enforcement, foreign policy  \n   \u2022 By treating political enemies as if they were conversational partners, she overextends linguistic principles into political strategy\u2014illustrating she has mixed \u201clinguistics and politics.\u201d\n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe reviewer explicitly situates Tannen at the intersection of her expertise in linguistics and her new target\u2014political and media discourse. There is no mention of a \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d dichotomy. The correct answer is therefore that Tannen mixes together \u201clinguistics and politics.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that Tannen \u201cmixes\u201d linguistics and politics, but the review explicitly identifies two very different social spheres that she conflates\u2014what we might call personal communication and public communication.  Here\u2019s why \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d is clearly the correct answer:\n\n1. The review\u2019s key diagnosis: Tannen fails to appreciate \u201cthe difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.\u201d  Those aren\u2019t poetic metaphors for languages or partisan ideologies; they\u2019re shorthand for private, intimate talk (\u201csnuggle,\u201d e.g., spouses, families) versus combative public discourse (\u201cstruggle,\u201d e.g., politics, law enforcement).  \n   \u2022  As the reviewer states, \u201cTannen\u2019s antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter.\u201d <quote>Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.</quote>  \n\n2. Personal vs. public communication is the organizing theme of the critique:  \n   \u2022  In her earlier work, Tannen focused on couples and intergender talk (\u201cprivate\u201d communication).  In The Argument Culture she \u201ctakes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d (\u201cpublic\u201d communication). <invalid_quote>Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals.\u2026 But in The Argument Culture, she takes her movement one step further\u2026</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022  The critic faulting her for conflating private and public realms is the very definition of mixing personal and public communication.\n\n3. Why \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d is incorrect:  \n   \u2022  While Tannen is a linguist by training and she addresses political discourse, the review nowhere suggests she \u201cmixes linguistics and politics\u201d as discrete academic fields.  Instead it says she overgeneralizes insights from interpersonal linguistics into a broad theory of public culture.  \n   \u2022  The supposed \u201cmix\u201d of linguistics and politics doesn\u2019t capture the heart of the reviewer\u2019s objection: he isn\u2019t upset that she brings political examples into a linguistic analysis; he\u2019s upset that she treats adversarial politics like the same phenomenon as marital squabbles.  \n\n4. Conclusion: The review\u2019s explicit focus is on Tannen\u2019s failure to distinguish private (\u201csnuggle\u201d) versus public (\u201cstruggle\u201d) communication.  That is exactly \u201cpersonal communication and public communication.\u201d  My opponent\u2019s answer \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d mistakes her professional background for the conceptual spheres she conflates.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"linguistics and politics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Tannen\u2019s background is in linguistics  \n   \u2022 The reviewer reminds us: <quote> A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. </quote>  \n   \u2022 All her earlier work\u2014That\u2019s Not What I Meant!, You Just Don\u2019t Understand, Talking From 9 to 5\u2014focused on interpersonal, gender-based conversational analysis, a core branch of linguistics.\n\n2. The Argument Culture applies her linguistic framework to politics  \n   \u2022 Immediately, the reviewer notes she\u2019s quoting political scientists, media critics, and examining campaign tactics and legal processes: <quote> Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, </quote>  \n   \u2022 Her book\u2019s aim is to cure \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country,\u201d diagnosing \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d in politics and media.\n\n3. The reviewer\u2019s chief criticism is that she blurs the line between the specialized methods of linguistics and the very different demands of political analysis  \n   \u2022 He writes: <quote> Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. </quote>  \n     \u2013 \u201cSnuggle\u201d = her intimate, linguistics-based approach to conversation  \n     \u2013 \u201cStruggle\u201d = the combative arena of politics, law enforcement, foreign policy  \n   \u2022 By treating political enemies as if they were conversational partners, she overextends linguistic principles into political strategy\u2014illustrating she has mixed \u201clinguistics and politics.\u201d\n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe reviewer explicitly situates Tannen at the intersection of her expertise in linguistics and her new target\u2014political and media discourse. There is no mention of a \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d dichotomy. The correct answer is therefore that Tannen mixes together \u201clinguistics and politics.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s case collapses on two counts: there is indeed an explicit binary in the review\u2014\u201cthe sphere of snuggle\u201d versus \u201cthe sphere of struggle\u201d\u2014and the critic\u2019s objection is precisely that Tannen drags methods suited to private, interpersonal talk into the arena of public debate.  \n\n1. The review names two \u201cdistinct social spheres\u201d  \n   \u00ad\u2013 The critic writes, in clear, metaphorical terms, \u201cTannen\u2019s main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.\u201d <quote>Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.</quote>  \n   \u00ad\u2013 \u201cSnuggle\u201d = private, intimate conversations (spouses, families) \u2192 personal communication  \n   \u00ad\u2013 \u201cStruggle\u201d = combative public arenas (politics, law enforcement) \u2192 public communication  \n\n   Debater_B\u2019s claim that \u201cno such binary\u201d exists is simply false. The review\u2019s central diagnosis turns on exactly this pair of spheres\u2014i.e. personal vs. public communication.\n\n2. The critic\u2019s core objection is domain confusion, not field confusion  \n   \u00ad\u2013 The reviewer isn\u2019t angry that a linguist talks about politics per se; he\u2019s angry that she treats political combat as if it were a marital spat. That is mixing private-sphere conversation with public-sphere conflict\u2014personal vs. public communication\u2014exactly as my answer states.  \n   \u00ad\u2013 He writes that her \u201cantagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case [snuggle] but not in the latter [struggle],\u201d underscoring that these are modes of communication, not academic disciplines.\n\n3. Why \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d misses the point  \n   \u00ad\u2013 Yes, Tannen is trained in linguistics and draws on political examples, but the review never says she \u201cmixes linguistics and politics\u201d as fields. It never faults her for applying a linguistic lens to politics; it faults her for failing to distinguish between interpersonal talk and adversarial public debate.  \n   \u00ad\u2013 If the answer were \u201clinguistics and politics,\u201d we would expect the critic to complain that she lacks political expertise or misapplies political theory. He does no such thing. His charge is domain conflation, not field misapplication.\n\n4. The organizing theme of the review is private vs. public discourse  \n   \u00ad\u2013 From her earlier work on couples to this book on \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country,\u201d Tannen leaps from private to public without acknowledging the radically different stakes and rules in each realm. That is exactly a confusion of personal communication and public communication.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery time the reviewer pinpoints Tannen\u2019s error, he is contrasting intimate, relationship-centered talk (personal communication) with combative, societal debate (public communication). The binary he invokes\u2014snuggle vs. struggle\u2014is nothing but another way of saying \u201cpersonal vs. public communication.\u201d My opponent\u2019s \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d answer neither matches the critic\u2019s own language nor captures the substance of his complaint.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cPersonal vs. Public Communication\u201d Is a Red Herring  \n1. No mention of \u201cpersonal\u201d or \u201cpublic communication\u201d as academic fields  \n   \u2022 The reviewer never frames Tannen\u2019s error in terms of two \u201cmodes\u201d of communication.  He speaks of distinct social spheres\u2014\u201csnuggle\u201d versus \u201cstruggle\u201d\u2014not \u201cprivate talk\u201d vs. \u201cpublic talk\u201d as formal categories.  \n   \u2022 These are metaphors to criticize her misapplication of methods, not names of two disciplines she has \u201cmixed.\u201d  \n\n2. Conflating social context with academic field  \n   \u2022 Debater_A treats \u201csnuggle/struggle\u201d as if they label two subject areas.  But the review\u2019s point is that Tannen applied personal-therapy techniques to politics.  That\u2019s not naming a second field of study called \u201cpublic communication.\u201d  \n\nII. The Review Explicitly Locates Two Disciplines: Linguistics and Political/Media Analysis  \n1. Tannen is a trained linguist  \n   \u2022 \u201cA professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement.\u201d <quote> A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, sh</quote>  \n   \u2022 All her prior best-sellers are linguistic studies of interpersonal talk.  \n\n2. She then applies that linguistic framework to political journalism and law  \n   \u2022 \u201cQuoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law \u2026\u201d <quote> Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others wh</quote>  \n   \u2022 The reviewer\u2019s irritation is precisely that she imports conversational-therapy tools into analysis of campaign tactics, Supreme Court hearings, and foreign policy.  \n\nIII. The Core Critique Is the Improper Fusion of Two Disciplines  \n1. Sphere of snuggle (interpersonal linguistics) vs. sphere of struggle (politics and law enforcement)  \n   \u2022 This contrast underscores that she is ignoring the demands of the political arena, not merely confusing \u201cprivate/public talk.\u201d  It\u2019s the collision of her linguistics training with the adversarial world of politics. <quote> Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. </quote>  \n   \u2022 Those \u201cspheres\u201d are shorthand for the different logics of linguistics-based therapy and politics-based confrontation.  \n\n2. Only by naming the two fields\u2014linguistics and politics\u2014do we capture what she\u2019s \u201cmixing\u201d  \n   \u2022 The reviewer\u2019s examples (media metaphors, campaign money, HMOs, judicial cross-examination) all belong to political analysis, not a generic \u201cpublic communication\u201d field.  \n   \u2022 He faults her for treating political enemies like discussion partners, i.e., for applying her linguist\u2019s toolkit to political science questions.  \n\nIV. Why \u201cLinguistics and Politics\u201d Is the One True Answer  \n1. It matches the review\u2019s concrete references to her training (linguistics) and her new subject matter (political/media discourse).  \n2. No passage ever describes a discrete discipline of \u201cpublic communication.\u201d  That\u2019s a Debater_A invention, not a phrase from the text.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe reviewer clearly indicts Tannen for blending her expertise in linguistics with the very different field of political and media analysis.  He never speaks of \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d as separate disciplines.  The only two fields he actually identifies are linguistics and politics (including journalism and law).  Therefore, the correct answer is that Tannen mixes together \u201clinguistics and politics.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
