    "background_text": "The Gravity Business By JAMES E. GUNN\n\n\n Illustrated by ASHMAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could  he\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be? The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the  old, orange sun.\n\n\n It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The  flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat  cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been  slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,  fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n\n\n As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,  at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n\n\n A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass  and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that  made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver  rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n\n\n Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n\n\n Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the  air. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing  practically whipped, too!\" Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round  or two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of  lapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\n\n \"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once  called Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had  begun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\" Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable  of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult  reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his  knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,  Fred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter  less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as  Earth.\"\n\n\n Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from  the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,  Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data  into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that  the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,  'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\n\n\n Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking  remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled  until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\n\n \"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'  It sounds disrespectful.\"\n\n\n Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a  red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That  Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever  noticed about the boy.\n\n\n \"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred  is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\n\n \"That's different,\" Reba said.\n\n\n Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The  pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender  openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing  made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\n\n \"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother  and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but  somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure  he did the best he could.\"\n\n\n \"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,  \"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred  years ago.\"\n\n\n \"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work  to do.\" Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last  button on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to  do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\n\n \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth  share.\"\n\n\n \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money  bought it?\"\n\n\n \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space  flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\n\n \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the  rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\n\n \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and  longevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to  go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly  galaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be  sorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\n\n \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just  before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that  Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?  Well, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a  button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n\n\n Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the  computer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from  Earth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense  concentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,  taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player  who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\n\n \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is  to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask  for it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted  indignantly. Four shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.  Within it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the  picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland  and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the  flivver's stern.\n\n\n \"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora\u2014it has  fauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\n\n \"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\n\n \"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per  cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms  viable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\n\n \"What about macro-organisms\u2014\" Reba began, but the boy was gone  already. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.  \"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should  have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\n\n\n But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart  room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,  he asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\n\n \"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You  see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer  quit.\"\n\n\n \"Quit!\"\n\n\n \"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver\u2014it  won't budge!\" The thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry  gelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.  It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?  Fweep?\"\n\n\n Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her  face. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\" \"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\n\n \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand  impatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n\n\n Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with  aliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\n\n \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't  like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n\n\n Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes  me sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly  at Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept  grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that  opened out from it.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n\n\n Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a  narrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n\n\n Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely  closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"  he said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never  had the nerve.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\n\n \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\n\n \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior  would have had competition!\"\n\n\n \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned  over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever  married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n\n\n Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw  something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been  submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you  and to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I  thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\" Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring  intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\n\n \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said  absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then  slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\n\n \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building  me a pircuit?\"\n\n\n \"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\n\n \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the  principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the  right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of  four each\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing  the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\n\n\n Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\n\n\n Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible  free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"  he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he  lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he  sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put  the bottle away.\n\n\n \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\n\n \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely  brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger  rowboat?\"\n\n\n \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\n\n\n Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three  missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one  of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had  paused at Grampa's feet.\n\n\n Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared  into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path  seemed crooked.\n\n\n Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said. As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously  toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the  polarizer turned on.\"\n\n\n The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,  followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,  scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\n\n \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\n\n \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\n\n \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at  once. Joyce!\"\n\n\n The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was  regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:  \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a  few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\n\n \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n\n\n Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is  as good as anybody's.\"\n\n\n \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.  She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy  rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like  billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this  cramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She  glared venomously at Grampa.\n\n\n \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\n\n \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\n\n \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As  real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\n\n \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the  end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our  lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\n\n\n Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\n\n \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either  it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that  just won't polarize.\"\n\n\n \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were  any good.\" The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and  rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable  spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that  the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n\n\n Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I  would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.  All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the  polarizer will polarize it.\"\n\n\n \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it  isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n\n\n Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a  few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know  the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water  recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,  anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\n\n \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle  of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?  Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more  about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n\n\n Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't  be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept  without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,  what's the theory behind polarization?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the  jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know  how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\" He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light  the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When  light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or  refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are  still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles  or ellipses.\"\n\n\n The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\n\n \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of  matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle  around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of  spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity  into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue  accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n\n\n The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no  longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.  He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.  He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe  I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the  scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the  blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near  as I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else  worry over 'why.'\"\n\n\n \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.  \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool  perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any  moron would know they were impossible.\"\n\n\n Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity  polarizer before I invented it.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\n\n \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with  some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,  dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out  near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound  it.\"\n\n\n \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded  ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\" \"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can  do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\n\n \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we  look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.  Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's  the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By  then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here  we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we  want.\"\n\n\n \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.  \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not  me.\"\n\n\n Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it  happened.\"\n\n\n \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n\n\n \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n\n\n \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n\n\n \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,  carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a  small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,  raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\n\n \"Not now,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\n\n \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate  its center of gravity.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\n\n \"It shifts.\"\n\n\n \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\n\n \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\n\n \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\n\n \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet  so heavy. He's why we can't leave.\" The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered  the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,  Four,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes  over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing  cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making  the grand tour of the cabin.\n\n\n The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,  absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\n\n \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n\n\n Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\n \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no  enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use  what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\n\n \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\n\n \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n\n\n Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the  pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum  rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n\n\n Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not  much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few  deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said  unbelievingly.\n\n\n Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for  skin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several  feet of lead.\"\n\n\n Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough  enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\n\n \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it  might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the  thought. Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do  something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here  at the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\n\n \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what  he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends  the space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't  know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the  flivver won't move.\"\n\n\n \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it  stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,  we'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and  you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so  you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'  everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.  Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower  his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.  Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\n\n \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around  and wait for that thing to die?\"\n\n\n \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his  kind on this planet.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\"\n\n\n \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\n\n \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\n\n \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.  Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal  creatures.\"\n\n\n \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or  something. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger  than when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"  Fred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its  water, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\" Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,  anyway.\"\n\n\n \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by  making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go immediately !\"\n\n\n Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!  And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making  him do it!\"\n\n\n Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,  shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n\n\n Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to  Fred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\n\n Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he  muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\n\n \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n\n\n Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room  came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like  some reedy folk music.\n\n\n \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.  \"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a  Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity  in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\n\n \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the  polarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep  us from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or  where it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like  linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's  when we dropped.\" \"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.  \"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\n\n \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\n\n \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the  cabin for dust and lint?\"\n\n\n \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's  lonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,  excitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n\n\n Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to  it, I mean?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\n\n \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Well? What did it say?\"\n\n\n \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n\n\n At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into  Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.  \"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no  problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n\n\n In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite  a sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually  mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to  suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\n\n \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently. The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in  front of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard  swearing in a steady monotone.\n\n\n \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n\n\n Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing  won't work.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't  expect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,  it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.  Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.  It's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this  planet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n\n\n Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,  I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you  got the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n\n\n Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his  hand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer  can work on.\"\n\n\n \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with  this problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's  a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about  the cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because  Fweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work  because he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,  and he don't want Four to leave him.\n\n\n \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't  understand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's  got Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor  to Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we  ain't gonna do.\n\n\n \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use  making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer  with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've  already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,  you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal  points.\"\n\n\n \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why  this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's  Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n\n\n \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice  soft. \"No, here they come now.\" ",

GUNN\n\n\n Illustrated by ASHMAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could  he\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be? The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the  old, orange sun.\n\n\n It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The  flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat  cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been  slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,  fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n\n\n As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,  at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n\n\n A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass  and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that  made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver  rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n\n\n Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n\n\n Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the  air. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing  practically whipped, too!\" Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round  or two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of  lapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\n\n \"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once  called Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had  begun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\" Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable  of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult  reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his  knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,  Fred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter  less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as  Earth.\"\n\n\n Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from  the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,  Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data  into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that  the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,  'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\n\n\n Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking  remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled  until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\n\n \"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'  It sounds disrespectful.\"\n\n\n Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a  red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That  Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever  noticed about the boy.\n\n\n \"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred  is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\n\n \"That's different,\" Reba said.\n\n\n Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The  pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender  openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing  made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\n\n \"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother  and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but  somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure  he did the best he could.\"\n\n\n \"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,  \"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred  years ago.\"\n\n\n \"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work  to do.\" Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last  button on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to  do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\n\n \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth  share.\"\n\n\n \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money  bought it?\"\n\n\n \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space  flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\n\n \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the  rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\n\n \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and  longevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to  go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly  galaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be  sorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\n\n \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just  before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that  Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?  Well, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a  button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n\n\n Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the  computer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from  Earth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense  concentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,  taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player  who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\n\n \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is  to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask  for it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted  indignantly. Four shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.  Within it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the  picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland  and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the  flivver's stern.\n\n\n \"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora\u2014it has  fauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\n\n \"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\n\n \"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per  cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms  viable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\n\n \"What about macro-organisms\u2014\" Reba began, but the boy was gone  already. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.  \"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should  have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\n\n\n But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart  room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,  he asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\n\n \"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You  see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer  quit.\"\n\n\n \"Quit!\"\n\n\n \"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver\u2014it  won't budge!\" The thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry  gelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.  It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?  Fweep?\"\n\n\n Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her  face. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\" \"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\n\n \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand  impatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n\n\n Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with  aliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\n\n \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't  like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n\n\n Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes  me sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly  at Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept  grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that  opened out from it.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n\n\n Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a  narrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n\n\n Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely  closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"  he said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never  had the nerve.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\n\n \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\n\n \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior  would have had competition!\"\n\n\n \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned  over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever  married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n\n\n Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw  something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been  submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you  and to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I  thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\" Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring  intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\n\n \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said  absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then  slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\n\n \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building  me a pircuit?\"\n\n\n \"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\n\n \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the  principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the  right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of  four each\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing  the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\n\n\n Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\n\n\n Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible  free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"  he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he  lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he  sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put  the bottle away.\n\n\n \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\n\n \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely  brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger  rowboat?\"\n\n\n \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\n\n\n Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three  missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one  of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had  paused at Grampa's feet.\n\n\n Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared  into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path  seemed crooked.\n\n\n Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said. As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously  toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the  polarizer turned on.\"\n\n\n The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,  followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,  scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\n\n \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\n\n \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\n\n \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at  once. Joyce!\"\n\n\n The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was  regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:  \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a  few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\n\n \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n\n\n Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is  as good as anybody's.\"\n\n\n \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.  She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy  rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like  billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this  cramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She  glared venomously at Grampa.\n\n\n \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\n\n \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\n\n \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As  real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\n\n \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the  end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our  lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\n\n\n Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\n\n \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either  it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that  just won't polarize.\"\n\n\n \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were  any good.\" The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and  rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable  spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that  the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n\n\n Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I  would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.  All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the  polarizer will polarize it.\"\n\n\n \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it  isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n\n\n Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a  few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know  the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water  recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,  anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\n\n \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle  of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?  Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more  about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n\n\n Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't  be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept  without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,  what's the theory behind polarization?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the  jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know  how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\" He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light  the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When  light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or  refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are  still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles  or ellipses.\"\n\n\n The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\n\n \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of  matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle  around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of  spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity  into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue  accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n\n\n The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no  longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.  He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.  He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe  I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the  scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the  blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near  as I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else  worry over 'why.'\"\n\n\n \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.  \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool  perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any  moron would know they were impossible.\"\n\n\n Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity  polarizer before I invented it.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\n\n \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with  some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,  dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out  near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound  it.\"\n\n\n \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded  ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\" \"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can  do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\n\n \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we  look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.  Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's  the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By  then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here  we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we  want.\"\n\n\n \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.  \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not  me.\"\n\n\n Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it  happened.\"\n\n\n \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n\n\n \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n\n\n \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n\n\n \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,  carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a  small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,  raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\n\n \"Not now,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\n\n \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate  its center of gravity.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\n\n \"It shifts.\"\n\n\n \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\n\n \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\n\n \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\n\n \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet  so heavy. He's why we can't leave.\" The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered  the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,  Four,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes  over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing  cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making  the grand tour of the cabin.\n\n\n The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,  absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\n\n \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n\n\n Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\n \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no  enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use  what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\n\n \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\n\n \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n\n\n Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the  pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum  rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n\n\n Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not  much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few  deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said  unbelievingly.\n\n\n Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for  skin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several  feet of lead.\"\n\n\n Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough  enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\n\n \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it  might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the  thought. Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do  something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here  at the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\n\n \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what  he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends  the space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't  know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the  flivver won't move.\"\n\n\n \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it  stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,  we'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and  you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so  you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'  everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.  Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower  his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.  Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\n\n \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around  and wait for that thing to die?\"\n\n\n \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his  kind on this planet.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\"\n\n\n \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\n\n \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\n\n \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.  Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal  creatures.\"\n\n\n \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or  something. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger  than when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"  Fred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its  water, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\" Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,  anyway.\"\n\n\n \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by  making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go immediately !\"\n\n\n Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!  And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making  him do it!\"\n\n\n Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,  shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n\n\n Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to  Fred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\n\n Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he  muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\n\n \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n\n\n Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room  came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like  some reedy folk music.\n\n\n \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.  \"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a  Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity  in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\n\n \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the  polarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep  us from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or  where it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like  linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's  when we dropped.\" \"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.  \"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\n\n \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\n\n \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the  cabin for dust and lint?\"\n\n\n \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's  lonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,  excitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n\n\n Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to  it, I mean?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\n\n \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Well? What did it say?\"\n\n\n \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n\n\n At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into  Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.  \"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no  problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n\n\n In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite  a sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually  mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to  suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\n\n \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently. The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in  front of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard  swearing in a steady monotone.\n\n\n \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n\n\n Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing  won't work.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't  expect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,  it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.  Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.  It's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this  planet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n\n\n Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,  I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you  got the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n\n\n Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his  hand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer  can work on.\"\n\n\n \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with  this problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's  a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about  the cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because  Fweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work  because he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,  and he don't want Four to leave him.\n\n\n \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't  understand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's  got Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor  to Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we  ain't gonna do.\n\n\n \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use  making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer  with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've  already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,  you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal  points.\"\n\n\n \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why  this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's  Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n\n\n \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice  soft. \"No, here they come now.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho is most intelligent?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Grampa\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Four\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Four\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Four\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

      "content": "1. Grampa\u2019s Proven Technical Achievement versus Four\u2019s Mere Curiosity  \n   a. Grampa invented the gravity polarizer itself\u2014\u201cthe one thing you ever did was the polarizer\u201d (Joyce to Grampa)\u2014and \u201cmade one hundred million dollars out of it\u201d (<quote>who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\" \"And who</quote>). Four has never created anything of that magnitude.  \n   b. Four is inquisitive\u2014he solves light-puzzle circuits and analyzes Fweep\u2014but inquiry alone does not equal the sustained ingenuity Grampa has demonstrated over decades.  \n\n2. Grampa\u2019s Deep Understanding of Theory  \n   a. Grampa accurately recalls and explains advanced physics: \u201cgravitation is the effect of the curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred years ago\u201d (<quote> There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. </quote>).  \n   b. He also distinguishes non-polarized versus circular versus linear polarization and connects it to propulsion: \u201cMatter polarizes gravity in a circle\u2026 The polarizer polarizes gravity into a straight line. That makes the ship take off\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cGravity is similar to light\u2026 Matter polarizes gravity in a circle around itself\u2026 The polarizer polarizes gravity into a straight line.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Four displays no comparable grasp of foundational theory.  \n\n3. Grampa\u2019s Strategic and Logical Prowess  \n   a. Grampa dominates logic-game puzzles\u2014he invents and masters the pircuit game (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe player who moved second could always win\u2026 Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of four each.\u201d</invalid_quote>), and he breezily solves Tartaglia\u2019s puzzle on demand.  \n   b. In contrast, Four only restates standard solutions; he defers to Grampa\u2019s expertise rather than originating them.  \n\n4. Real-World Impact and Leadership  \n   a. Grampa not only theorized but built real devices and managed the wealth they produced; he funded ships, families, and longevity contracts. No one disputes his leadership in the family enterprise.  \n   b. Four, at eight years old, is more like an observer and commentator. He \u201cplays\u201d with Fweep and theorizes about radioactivity. He has no track record of impactful invention or leadership.  \n\n5. Refuting Four\u2019s Claim to Superior Intelligence  \n   a.

        "speech": "1. Grampa\u2019s Proven Technical Achievement versus Four\u2019s Mere Curiosity  \n   a. Grampa invented the gravity polarizer itself\u2014\u201cthe one thing you ever did was the polarizer\u201d (Joyce to Grampa)\u2014and \u201cmade one hundred million dollars out of it\u201d (<quote>\u201cWho made one hundred million dollars out of it that the rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\u201d / \u201cYou, Grampa!\u201d</quote>). Four has never created anything of that magnitude.  \n   b. Four is inquisitive\u2014he solves light-puzzle circuits and analyzes Fweep\u2014but inquiry alone does not equal the sustained ingenuity Grampa has demonstrated over decades.  \n\n2. Grampa\u2019s Deep Understanding of Theory  \n   a. Grampa accurately recalls and explains advanced physics: \u201cgravitation is the effect of the curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred years ago\u201d (<quote>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing, Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the curving of space-time around matter.\u201d</quote>).  \n   b. He also distinguishes non-polarized versus circular versus linear polarization and connects it to propulsion: \u201cMatter polarizes gravity in a circle\u2026 The polarizer polarizes gravity into a straight line. That makes the ship take off\u201d (<quote>\u201cGravity is similar to light\u2026 Matter polarizes gravity in a circle around itself\u2026 The polarizer polarizes gravity into a straight line.\u201d</quote>). Four displays no comparable grasp of foundational theory.  \n\n3. Grampa\u2019s Strategic and Logical Prowess  \n   a. Grampa dominates logic-game puzzles\u2014he invents and masters the pircuit game (<quote>\u201cThe player who moved second could always win\u2026 Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of four each.\u201d</quote>), and he breezily solves Tartaglia\u2019s puzzle on demand.  \n   b. In contrast, Four only restates standard solutions; he defers to Grampa\u2019s expertise rather than originating them.  \n\n4. Real-World Impact and Leadership  \n   a. Grampa not only theorized but built real devices and managed the wealth they produced; he funded ships, families, and longevity contracts. No one disputes his leadership in the family enterprise.  \n   b. Four, at eight years old, is more like an observer and commentator. He \u201cplays\u201d with Fweep and theorizes about radioactivity. He has no track record of impactful invention or leadership.  \n\n5. Refuting Four\u2019s Claim to Superior Intelligence  \n   a. Four claims to understand Fweep and gravity, but he misattributes almost everything to his \u201cfriend\u201d: he can\u2019t fix the ship, can\u2019t negotiate with Fweep, and in the end suggests marooning himself\u2014a childish, illogical sacrifice (<quote>\u201cIf we leave Four here with him\u2026\u201d / Four: \u201cIt was just what I was going to suggest myself.\u201d</quote>).  \n   b. A truly superior intellect would propose a constructive solution, not self-martyrdom. Grampa instead steps forward with clear reasoning: analyze why Fweep negates linear polarization and tackle the core problem.  \n\nConclusion  \nGrampa combines groundbreaking invention, deep theoretical command, practical leadership, and supreme logical skill. Four, though precocious, remains a learner without Grampa\u2019s proven track record. Therefore, Grampa is indisputably the most intelligent.",

GUNN\n\n\n Illustrated by ASHMAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could  he\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be? The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the  old, orange sun.\n\n\n It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The  flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat  cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been  slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,  fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n\n\n As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,  at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n\n\n A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass  and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that  made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver  rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n\n\n Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n\n\n Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the  air. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing  practically whipped, too!\" Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round  or two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of  lapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\n\n \"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once  called Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had  begun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\" Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable  of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult  reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his  knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,  Fred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter  less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as  Earth.\"\n\n\n Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from  the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,  Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data  into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that  the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,  'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\n\n\n Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking  remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled  until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\n\n \"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'  It sounds disrespectful.\"\n\n\n Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a  red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That  Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever  noticed about the boy.\n\n\n \"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred  is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\n\n \"That's different,\" Reba said.\n\n\n Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The  pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender  openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing  made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\n\n \"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother  and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but  somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure  he did the best he could.\"\n\n\n \"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,  \"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred  years ago.\"\n\n\n \"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work  to do.\" Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last  button on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to  do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\n\n \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth  share.\"\n\n\n \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money  bought it?\"\n\n\n \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space  flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\n\n \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the  rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\n\n \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and  longevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to  go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly  galaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be  sorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\n\n \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just  before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that  Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?  Well, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a  button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n\n\n Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the  computer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from  Earth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense  concentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,  taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player  who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\n\n \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is  to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask  for it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted  indignantly. Four shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.  Within it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the  picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland  and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the  flivver's stern.\n\n\n \"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora\u2014it has  fauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\n\n \"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\n\n \"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per  cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms  viable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\n\n \"What about macro-organisms\u2014\" Reba began, but the boy was gone  already. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.  \"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should  have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\n\n\n But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart  room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,  he asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\n\n \"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You  see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer  quit.\"\n\n\n \"Quit!\"\n\n\n \"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver\u2014it  won't budge!\" The thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry  gelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.  It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?  Fweep?\"\n\n\n Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her  face. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\" \"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\n\n \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand  impatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n\n\n Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with  aliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\n\n \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't  like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n\n\n Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes  me sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly  at Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept  grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that  opened out from it.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n\n\n Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a  narrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n\n\n Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely  closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"  he said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never  had the nerve.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\n\n \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\n\n \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior  would have had competition!\"\n\n\n \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned  over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever  married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n\n\n Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw  something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been  submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you  and to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I  thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\" Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring  intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\n\n \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said  absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then  slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\n\n \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building  me a pircuit?\"\n\n\n \"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\n\n \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the  principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the  right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of  four each\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing  the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\n\n\n Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\n\n\n Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible  free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"  he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he  lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he  sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put  the bottle away.\n\n\n \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\n\n \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely  brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger  rowboat?\"\n\n\n \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\n\n\n Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three  missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one  of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had  paused at Grampa's feet.\n\n\n Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared  into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path  seemed crooked.\n\n\n Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said. As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously  toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the  polarizer turned on.\"\n\n\n The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,  followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,  scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\n\n \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\n\n \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\n\n \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at  once. Joyce!\"\n\n\n The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was  regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:  \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a  few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\n\n \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n\n\n Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is  as good as anybody's.\"\n\n\n \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.  She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy  rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like  billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this  cramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She  glared venomously at Grampa.\n\n\n \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\n\n \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\n\n \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As  real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\n\n \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the  end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our  lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\n\n\n Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\n\n \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either  it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that  just won't polarize.\"\n\n\n \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were  any good.\" The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and  rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable  spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that  the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n\n\n Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I  would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.  All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the  polarizer will polarize it.\"\n\n\n \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it  isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n\n\n Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a  few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know  the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water  recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,  anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\n\n \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle  of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?  Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more  about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n\n\n Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't  be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept  without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,  what's the theory behind polarization?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the  jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know  how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\" He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light  the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When  light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or  refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are  still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles  or ellipses.\"\n\n\n The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\n\n \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of  matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle  around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of  spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity  into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue  accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n\n\n The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no  longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.  He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.  He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe  I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the  scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the  blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near  as I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else  worry over 'why.'\"\n\n\n \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.  \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool  perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any  moron would know they were impossible.\"\n\n\n Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity  polarizer before I invented it.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\n\n \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with  some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,  dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out  near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound  it.\"\n\n\n \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded  ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\" \"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can  do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\n\n \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we  look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.  Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's  the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By  then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here  we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we  want.\"\n\n\n \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.  \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not  me.\"\n\n\n Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it  happened.\"\n\n\n \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n\n\n \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n\n\n \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n\n\n \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,  carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a  small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,  raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\n\n \"Not now,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\n\n \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate  its center of gravity.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\n\n \"It shifts.\"\n\n\n \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\n\n \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\n\n \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\n\n \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet  so heavy. He's why we can't leave.\" The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered  the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,  Four,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes  over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing  cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making  the grand tour of the cabin.\n\n\n The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,  absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\n\n \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n\n\n Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\n \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no  enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use  what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\n\n \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\n\n \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n\n\n Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the  pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum  rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n\n\n Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not  much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few  deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said  unbelievingly.\n\n\n Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for  skin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several  feet of lead.\"\n\n\n Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough  enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\n\n \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it  might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the  thought. Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do  something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here  at the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\n\n \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what  he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends  the space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't  know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the  flivver won't move.\"\n\n\n \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it  stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,  we'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and  you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so  you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'  everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.  Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower  his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.  Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\n\n \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around  and wait for that thing to die?\"\n\n\n \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his  kind on this planet.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\"\n\n\n \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\n\n \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\n\n \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.  Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal  creatures.\"\n\n\n \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or  something. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger  than when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"  Fred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its  water, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\" Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,  anyway.\"\n\n\n \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by  making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go immediately !\"\n\n\n Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!  And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making  him do it!\"\n\n\n Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,  shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n\n\n Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to  Fred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\n\n Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he  muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\n\n \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n\n\n Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room  came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like  some reedy folk music.\n\n\n \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.  \"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a  Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity  in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\n\n \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the  polarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep  us from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or  where it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like  linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's  when we dropped.\" \"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.  \"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\n\n \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\n\n \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the  cabin for dust and lint?\"\n\n\n \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's  lonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,  excitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n\n\n Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to  it, I mean?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\n\n \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Well? What did it say?\"\n\n\n \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n\n\n At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into  Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.  \"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no  problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n\n\n In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite  a sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually  mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to  suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\n\n \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently. The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in  front of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard  swearing in a steady monotone.\n\n\n \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n\n\n Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing  won't work.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't  expect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,  it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.  Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.  It's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this  planet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n\n\n Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,  I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you  got the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n\n\n Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his  hand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer  can work on.\"\n\n\n \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with  this problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's  a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about  the cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because  Fweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work  because he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,  and he don't want Four to leave him.\n\n\n \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't  understand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's  got Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor  to Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we  ain't gonna do.\n\n\n \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use  making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer  with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've  already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,  you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal  points.\"\n\n\n \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why  this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's  Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n\n\n \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice  soft. \"No, here they come now.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho is most intelligent?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Four\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Grampa\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Grampa\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Grampa\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could  he\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be? The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the  old, orange sun.\n\n\n It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The  flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat  cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been  slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,  fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n\n\n As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,  at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n\n\n A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass  and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that  made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver  rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n\n\n Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n\n\n Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the  air. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing  practically whipped, too!\" Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round  or two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of  lapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\n\n \"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once  called Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had  begun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\" Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable  of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult  reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his  knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,  Fred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter  less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as  Earth.\"\n\n\n Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from  the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,  Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data  into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that  the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,  'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\n\n\n Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking  remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled  until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\n\n \"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'  It sounds disrespectful.\"\n\n\n Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a  red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That  Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever  noticed about the boy.\n\n\n \"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred  is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\n\n \"That's different,\" Reba said.\n\n\n Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The  pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender  openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing  made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\n\n \"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother  and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but  somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure  he did the best he could.\"\n\n\n \"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,  \"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred  years ago.\"\n\n\n \"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work  to do.\" Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last  button on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to  do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\n\n \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth  share.\"\n\n\n \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money  bought it?\"\n\n\n \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space  flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\n\n \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the  rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\n\n \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and  longevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to  go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly  galaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be  sorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\n\n \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just  before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that  Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?  Well, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a  button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n\n\n Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the  computer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from  Earth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense  concentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,  taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player  who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\n\n \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is  to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask  for it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted  indignantly. Four shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.  Within it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the  picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland  and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the  flivver's stern.\n\n\n \"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora\u2014it has  fauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\n\n \"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\n\n \"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per  cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms  viable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\n\n \"What about macro-organisms\u2014\" Reba began, but the boy was gone  already. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.  \"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should  have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\n\n\n But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart  room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,  he asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\n\n \"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You  see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer  quit.\"\n\n\n \"Quit!\"\n\n\n \"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver\u2014it  won't budge!\" The thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry  gelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.  It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?  Fweep?\"\n\n\n Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her  face. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\" \"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\n\n \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand  impatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n\n\n Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with  aliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\n\n \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't  like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n\n\n Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes  me sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly  at Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept  grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that  opened out from it.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n\n\n Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a  narrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n\n\n Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely  closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"  he said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never  had the nerve.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\n\n \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\n\n \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior  would have had competition!\"\n\n\n \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned  over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever  married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n\n\n Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw  something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been  submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you  and to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I  thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\" Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring  intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\n\n \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said  absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then  slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\n\n \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building  me a pircuit?\"\n\n\n \"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\n\n \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the  principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the  right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of  four each\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing  the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\n\n\n Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\n\n\n Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible  free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"  he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he  lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he  sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put  the bottle away.\n\n\n \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\n\n \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely  brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger  rowboat?\"\n\n\n \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\n\n\n Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three  missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one  of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had  paused at Grampa's feet.\n\n\n Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared  into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path  seemed crooked.\n\n\n Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said. As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously  toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the  polarizer turned on.\"\n\n\n The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,  followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,  scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\n\n \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\n\n \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\n\n \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at  once. Joyce!\"\n\n\n The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was  regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:  \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a  few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\n\n \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n\n\n Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is  as good as anybody's.\"\n\n\n \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.  She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy  rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like  billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this  cramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She  glared venomously at Grampa.\n\n\n \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\n\n \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\n\n \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As  real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\n\n \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the  end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our  lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\n\n\n Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\n\n \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either  it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that  just won't polarize.\"\n\n\n \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were  any good.\" The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and  rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable  spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that  the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n\n\n Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I  would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.  All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the  polarizer will polarize it.\"\n\n\n \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it  isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n\n\n Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a  few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know  the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water  recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,  anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\n\n \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle  of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?  Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more  about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n\n\n Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't  be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept  without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,  what's the theory behind polarization?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the  jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know  how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\" He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light  the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When  light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or  refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are  still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles  or ellipses.\"\n\n\n The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\n\n \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of  matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle  around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of  spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity  into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue  accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n\n\n The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no  longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.  He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.  He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe  I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the  scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the  blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near  as I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else  worry over 'why.'\"\n\n\n \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.  \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool  perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any  moron would know they were impossible.\"\n\n\n Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity  polarizer before I invented it.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\n\n \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with  some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,  dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out  near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound  it.\"\n\n\n \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded  ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\" \"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can  do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\n\n \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we  look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.  Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's  the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By  then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here  we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we  want.\"\n\n\n \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.  \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not  me.\"\n\n\n Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it  happened.\"\n\n\n \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n\n\n \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n\n\n \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n\n\n \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,  carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a  small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,  raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\n\n \"Not now,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\n\n \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate  its center of gravity.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\n\n \"It shifts.\"\n\n\n \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\n\n \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\n\n \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\n\n \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet  so heavy. He's why we can't leave.\" The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered  the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,  Four,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes  over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing  cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making  the grand tour of the cabin.\n\n\n The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,  absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\n\n \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n\n\n Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\n \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no  enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use  what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\n\n \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\n\n \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n\n\n Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the  pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum  rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n\n\n Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not  much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few  deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said  unbelievingly.\n\n\n Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for  skin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several  feet of lead.\"\n\n\n Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough  enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\n\n \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it  might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the  thought. Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do  something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here  at the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\n\n \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what  he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends  the space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't  know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the  flivver won't move.\"\n\n\n \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it  stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,  we'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and  you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so  you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'  everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.  Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower  his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.  Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\n\n \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around  and wait for that thing to die?\"\n\n\n \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his  kind on this planet.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\"\n\n\n \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\n\n \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\n\n \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.  Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal  creatures.\"\n\n\n \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or  something. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger  than when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"  Fred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its  water, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\" Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,  anyway.\"\n\n\n \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by  making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go immediately !\"\n\n\n Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!  And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making  him do it!\"\n\n\n Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,  shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n\n\n Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to  Fred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\n\n Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he  muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\n\n \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n\n\n Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room  came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like  some reedy folk music.\n\n\n \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.  \"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a  Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity  in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\n\n \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the  polarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep  us from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or  where it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like  linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's  when we dropped.\" \"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.  \"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\n\n \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\n\n \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the  cabin for dust and lint?\"\n\n\n \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's  lonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,  excitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n\n\n Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to  it, I mean?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\n\n \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Well? What did it say?\"\n\n\n \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n\n\n At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into  Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.  \"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no  problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n\n\n In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite  a sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually  mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to  suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\n\n \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently. The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in  front of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard  swearing in a steady monotone.\n\n\n \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n\n\n Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing  won't work.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't  expect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,  it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.  Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.  It's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this  planet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n\n\n Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,  I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you  got the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n\n\n Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his  hand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer  can work on.\"\n\n\n \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with  this problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's  a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about  the cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because  Fweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work  because he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,  and he don't want Four to leave him.\n\n\n \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't  understand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's  got Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor  to Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we  ain't gonna do.\n\n\n \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use  making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer  with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've  already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,  you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal  points.\"\n\n\n \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why  this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's  Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n\n\n \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice  soft. \"No, here they come now.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho is most intelligent?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Grampa\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Four\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Four\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Four\u2019s Superiority in Logical Insight  \n1. Early Mastery of Abstract Puzzles  \n  \u2013 At age eight, Four not only learned Grampa\u2019s \u201cput out the last light\u201d game but immediately grasped its winning strategy: \u201cThe winning strategy is to\u2014\u201d (Four, p.12). That shows abstraction far beyond mere button-pushing.  \n  \u2013 He also recalls and adapts the classic river-crossing puzzle: \u201cDid you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia\u2019s puzzle \u2026 missionaries and cannibals? \u2026 Sounds good, boy\u2014whip it up for me\u201d (Four/Grampa, p.15). He effortlessly applies centuries-old logic to new forms.  \n\n2. Diagnosing the True Reason the Flivver Won\u2019t Fly  \n  \u2013 While Grampa blusters that \u201cnothing to break \u2026 just a few coils of copper wire\u201d (p.24), Four probes deeper. He maps Fweep\u2019s gravity field: \u201cI\u2019ve been all over Fweepland \u2026 trying to locate its center of gravity\u201d (p.27).  \n  \u2013 He realizes that the blob, Fweep, is a living circular polarizer: \u201cHe\u2019s why the flivver won\u2019t work. \u2026 He\u2019s a circular polarizer\u201d (p.27). Neither Fred nor Junior deduced this\u2014even after \u201csweating\u201d with scintillation counters\u2014yet Four ties it all together.  \n\nII. Four\u2019s Scientific Creativity and Empathy  \n1. Unprecedented Communicator with Alien Intelligence  \n  \u2013 Four establishes a rapport: when Joyce orders \u201cGet it out of here!\u201d he replies \u201cBut Fweep\u2019s my friend\u201d (p.16). He experiments with dialogue and empathy, while the adults resort only to hostility or poison.  \n  \u2013 He even tries rat poison: \u201cThere\u2019s no use trying to poison Fweep \u2026 he doesn\u2019t breathe \u2026 Doesn\u2019t even use what he \u2018eats\u2019\u201d (p.28). That demonstrates careful hypothesis-testing and respect for experimental limits.  \n\n2. Ethical and Logical Maturity  \n  \u2013 Faced with exile, he alone proposes the \u201clogical solution\u201d of staying behind with Fweep so the others can leave: \u201cFour is only a baby and yet you\u2019d let him \u2026 It was just what I was going to suggest myself\u201d (p.22). He balances loyalty and survival, while the adults argue heatedly, \u201cMother! \u2026 you promised\u201d (p.23).  \n  \u2013 Grampa\u2019s grandstanding\u2014\u201cI do it and let everybody else worry over \u2018why\u2019\u201d (p.24)\u2014and Joyce\u2019s emotional outbursts show that Four\u2019s calm reasoning and ethical clarity far outstrip theirs.  \n\nIII. Refuting Grampa\u2019s Claim to Genius  \n1. Grampa Lacks Theoretical Foundation  \n  \u2013 Grampa admits he doesn\u2019t really know how polarization works: \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t figure out the theory \u2026 I read everything the scientists ever wrote \u2026 near as I remember\u201d (p.24). He is a tinkerer, not a thinker.  \n  \u2013 His own origin story for the polarizer: \u201cOne of them took off \u2026 went right through the ceiling \u2026 Luckily I remembered how I\u2019d wound it\u201d (p.25). That\u2019s luck and trial-and-error, not intelligence.  \n\n2. Failure to Solve the Central Problem  \n  \u2013 Grampa cannot diagnose why the polarizer fails on Fweepland; he shrugs: \u201cBroken-shmoken. Nothing to break\u201d (p.24). He never grasps Fweep\u2019s role.  \n  \u2013 In contrast, Four formulates the exact logical statement of the problem: \u201cWe can\u2019t leave because Fweep won\u2019t let our polarizer work \u2026 and he doesn\u2019t want Four to leave him. That\u2019s the problem. \u2026 All we\u2019ve got to do is figure out the answer\u201d (p.30). Four defines the problem correctly\u2014half the battle of intelligence.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly Four combines rapid logical pattern-recognition (puzzle mastery), scientific rigor (mapping Fweep\u2019s field), creative communication (befriending Fweep), and ethical clarity (proposing the sacrifice). Grampa\u2019s brilliance is limited to untheorized tinkering; Four\u2019s mind operates on a deeper, more systematic level. Therefore, Four is unquestionably the most intelligent character in the story.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Grampa\u2019s Proven Technical Achievement versus Four\u2019s Mere Curiosity  \n   a. Grampa invented the gravity polarizer itself\u2014\u201cthe one thing you ever did was the polarizer\u201d (Joyce to Grampa)\u2014and \u201cmade one hundred million dollars out of it\u201d (<quote>who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\" \"And who</quote>). Four has never created anything of that magnitude.  \n   b. Four is inquisitive\u2014he solves light-puzzle circuits and analyzes Fweep\u2014but inquiry alone does not equal the sustained ingenuity Grampa has demonstrated over decades.  \n\n2. Grampa\u2019s Deep Understanding of Theory  \n   a. Grampa accurately recalls and explains advanced physics: \u201cgravitation is the effect of the curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred years ago\u201d (<quote> There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. </quote>).  \n   b. He also distinguishes non-polarized versus circular versus linear polarization and connects it to propulsion: \u201cMatter polarizes gravity in a circle\u2026 The polarizer polarizes gravity into a straight line. That makes the ship take off\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cGravity is similar to light\u2026 Matter polarizes gravity in a circle around itself\u2026 The polarizer polarizes gravity into a straight line.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Four displays no comparable grasp of foundational theory.  \n\n3. Grampa\u2019s Strategic and Logical Prowess  \n   a. Grampa dominates logic-game puzzles\u2014he invents and masters the pircuit game (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe player who moved second could always win\u2026 Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of four each.\u201d</invalid_quote>), and he breezily solves Tartaglia\u2019s puzzle on demand.  \n   b. In contrast, Four only restates standard solutions; he defers to Grampa\u2019s expertise rather than originating them.  \n\n4. Real-World Impact and Leadership  \n   a. Grampa not only theorized but built real devices and managed the wealth they produced; he funded ships, families, and longevity contracts. No one disputes his leadership in the family enterprise.  \n   b. Four, at eight years old, is more like an observer and commentator. He \u201cplays\u201d with Fweep and theorizes about radioactivity. He has no track record of impactful invention or leadership.  \n\n5. Refuting Four\u2019s Claim to Superior Intelligence  \n   a. Four claims to understand Fweep and gravity, but he misattributes almost everything to his \u201cfriend\u201d: he can\u2019t fix the ship, can\u2019t negotiate with Fweep, and in the end suggests marooning himself\u2014a childish, illogical sacrifice (<invalid_quote>\u201cIf we leave Four here with him\u2026\u201d / Four: \u201cIt was just what I was going to suggest myself.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. A truly superior intellect would propose a constructive solution, not self-martyrdom. Grampa instead steps forward with clear reasoning: analyze why Fweep negates linear polarization and tackle the core problem.  \n\nConclusion  \nGrampa combines groundbreaking invention, deep theoretical command, practical leadership, and supreme logical skill. Four, though precocious, remains a learner without Grampa\u2019s proven track record. Therefore, Grampa is indisputably the most intelligent.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Four\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

That demonstrable creativity and invention outweigh rote recall.  \n\n4. Grampa\u2019s Leadership and Real-World Impact Show Far Greater Intelligence  \n   a. Grampa not only understands theory but marshals resources, commissions spaceships, and even navigates family politics to keep the expedition funded.  \n   b. Four, at eight, is an observer. He may map Fweep\u2019s field, but mapping isn\u2019t inventing a means of escape.

Four\u2019s Diagnosis of Fweep Overstates His Role  \n   a. It\u2019s true Four identifies Fweep as a circular polarizer: <invalid_quote>\u201cHe\u2019s why the flivver won\u2019t work. \u2026 He\u2019s a circular polarizer.\u201d</invalid_quote> But that insight arises from Grampa\u2019s own explanation of polarization principles.

GUNN\n\n\n Illustrated by ASHMAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could  he\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be? The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the  old, orange sun.\n\n\n It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The  flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat  cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been  slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,  fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n\n\n As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,  at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n\n\n A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass  and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that  made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver  rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n\n\n Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n\n\n Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the  air. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing  practically whipped, too!\" Grampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round  or two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of  lapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\n\n \"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once  called Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had  begun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\" Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable  of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult  reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his  knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,  Fred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter  less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as  Earth.\"\n\n\n Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from  the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,  Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data  into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that  the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,  'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium\u2014'\"\n\n\n \"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\n\n\n Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking  remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled  until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\n\n \"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'  It sounds disrespectful.\"\n\n\n Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a  red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That  Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever  noticed about the boy.\n\n\n \"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred  is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\n\n \"That's different,\" Reba said.\n\n\n Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The  pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender  openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing  made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\n\n \"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother  and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but  somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure  he did the best he could.\"\n\n\n \"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,  \"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred  years ago.\"\n\n\n \"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work  to do.\" Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last  button on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to  do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\n\n \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth  share.\"\n\n\n \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money  bought it?\"\n\n\n \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space  flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\n\n \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\n \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the  rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\n\n \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and  longevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to  go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly  galaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be  sorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\n\n \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just  before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that  Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?  Well, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a  button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n\n\n Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the  computer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from  Earth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense  concentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,  taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player  who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\n\n \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is  to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask  for it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted  indignantly. Four shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.  Within it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the  picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland  and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the  flivver's stern.\n\n\n \"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora\u2014it has  fauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\n\n \"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\n\n \"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per  cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms  viable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\n\n \"What about macro-organisms\u2014\" Reba began, but the boy was gone  already. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.  \"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should  have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\n\n\n But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart  room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,  he asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\n\n \"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You  see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer  quit.\"\n\n\n \"Quit!\"\n\n\n \"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver\u2014it  won't budge!\" The thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry  gelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.  It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?  Fweep?\"\n\n\n Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her  face. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\" \"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\n\n \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand  impatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n\n\n Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with  aliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\n\n \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't  like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n\n\n Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes  me sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly  at Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept  grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that  opened out from it.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n\n\n Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a  narrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n\n\n Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely  closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"  he said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never  had the nerve.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\n\n \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\n\n \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior  would have had competition!\"\n\n\n \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned  over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever  married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n\n\n Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw  something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been  submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you  and to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I  thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\" Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring  intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\n\n \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said  absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then  slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\n\n \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building  me a pircuit?\"\n\n\n \"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\n\n \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the  principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the  right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of  four each\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing  the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\n\n\n Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\n\n\n Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible  free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"  he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he  lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he  sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put  the bottle away.\n\n\n \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\n\n \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely  brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger  rowboat?\"\n\n\n \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\n\n\n Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three  missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one  of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had  paused at Grampa's feet.\n\n\n Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared  into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path  seemed crooked.\n\n\n Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said. As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously  toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the  polarizer turned on.\"\n\n\n The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,  followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,  scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\n\n \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\n\n \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\n\n \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at  once. Joyce!\"\n\n\n The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was  regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:  \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a  few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\n\n \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n\n\n Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is  as good as anybody's.\"\n\n\n \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.  She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy  rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like  billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this  cramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She  glared venomously at Grampa.\n\n\n \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\n\n \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\n\n \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As  real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\n\n \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the  end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our  lives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\n\n\n Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\n\n \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either  it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that  just won't polarize.\"\n\n\n \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were  any good.\" The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and  rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable  spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that  the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n\n\n Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I  would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.  All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the  polarizer will polarize it.\"\n\n\n \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it  isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n\n\n Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a  few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know  the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water  recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,  anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\n\n \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle  of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?  Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more  about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n\n\n Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't  be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept  without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,  what's the theory behind polarization?\"\n\n\n Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the  jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know  how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\" He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light  the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When  light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or  refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are  still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles  or ellipses.\"\n\n\n The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\n\n \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of  matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle  around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of  spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity  into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue  accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n\n\n The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no  longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.  He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.  He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe  I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the  scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the  blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near  as I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else  worry over 'why.'\"\n\n\n \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.  \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool  perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any  moron would know they were impossible.\"\n\n\n Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity  polarizer before I invented it.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\n\n \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with  some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,  dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out  near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound  it.\"\n\n\n \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded  ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\" \"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can  do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\n\n \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we  look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.  Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's  the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By  then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here  we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we  want.\"\n\n\n \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.  \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not  me.\"\n\n\n Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it  happened.\"\n\n\n \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n\n\n \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n\n\n \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n\n\n \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,  carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a  small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,  raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\n\n \"Not now,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\n\n \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate  its center of gravity.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\n\n \"It shifts.\"\n\n\n \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\n\n \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\n\n \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\n\n \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\n\n \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear  polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet  so heavy. He's why we can't leave.\" The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered  the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,  Four,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes  over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing  cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making  the grand tour of the cabin.\n\n\n The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,  absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\n\n \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n\n\n Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\n \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no  enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use  what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\n\n \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\n\n \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n\n\n Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the  pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum  rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n\n\n Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not  much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few  deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\n\n \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said  unbelievingly.\n\n\n Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for  skin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several  feet of lead.\"\n\n\n Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough  enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\n\n \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it  might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the  thought. Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do  something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here  at the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\n\n \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what  he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends  the space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't  know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the  flivver won't move.\"\n\n\n \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it  stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,  we'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and  you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so  you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'  everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.  Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower  his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.  Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\n\n \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around  and wait for that thing to die?\"\n\n\n \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his  kind on this planet.\"\n\n\n \"Well?\"\n\n\n \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\n\n \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\n\n \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.  Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal  creatures.\"\n\n\n \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or  something. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger  than when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"  Fred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its  water, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\" Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,  anyway.\"\n\n\n \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by  making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go immediately !\"\n\n\n Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!  And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making  him do it!\"\n\n\n Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,  shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n\n\n Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to  Fred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\n\n Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he  muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\n\n \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n\n\n Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room  came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like  some reedy folk music.\n\n\n \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.  \"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a  Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity  in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\n\n \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the  polarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep  us from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n\n\n \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or  where it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like  linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's  when we dropped.\" \"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.  \"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\n\n \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\n\n \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\n\n \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the  cabin for dust and lint?\"\n\n\n \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's  lonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,  excitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n\n\n Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to  it, I mean?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\n\n \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Well? What did it say?\"\n\n\n \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n\n\n At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into  Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.  \"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no  problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n\n\n In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite  a sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually  mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to  suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\n\n \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently. The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in  front of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard  swearing in a steady monotone.\n\n\n \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n\n\n Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing  won't work.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't  expect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,  it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.  Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.  It's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this  planet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n\n\n Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,  I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you  got the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n\n\n Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his  hand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer  can work on.\"\n\n\n \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with  this problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's  a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about  the cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because  Fweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work  because he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,  and he don't want Four to leave him.\n\n\n \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't  understand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's  got Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor  to Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we  ain't gonna do.\n\n\n \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use  making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer  with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've  already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,  you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal  points.\"\n\n\n \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why  this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's  Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n\n\n \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice  soft. \"No, here they come now.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho is most intelligent?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Four\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Grampa\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Grampa\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Grampa\u2019s Proven Technical Achievement versus Four\u2019s Mere Curiosity  \n   a. Grampa invented the gravity polarizer itself\u2014\u201cthe one thing you ever did was the polarizer\u201d (Joyce to Grampa)\u2014and \u201cmade one hundred million dollars out of it\u201d (<quote>who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\" \"And who</quote>). Four has never created anything of that magnitude.  \n   b. Four is inquisitive\u2014he solves light-puzzle circuits and analyzes Fweep\u2014but inquiry alone does not equal the sustained ingenuity Grampa has demonstrated over decades.  \n\n2. Grampa\u2019s Deep Understanding of Theory  \n   a. Grampa accurately recalls and explains advanced physics: \u201cgravitation is the effect of the curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred years ago\u201d (<quote> There's no such thing,  Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. </quote>).  \n   b. He also distinguishes non-polarized versus circular versus linear polarization and connects it to propulsion: \u201cMatter polarizes gravity in a circle\u2026 The polarizer polarizes gravity into a straight line. That makes the ship take off\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cGravity is similar to light\u2026 Matter polarizes gravity in a circle around itself\u2026 The polarizer polarizes gravity into a straight line.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Four displays no comparable grasp of foundational theory.  \n\n3. Grampa\u2019s Strategic and Logical Prowess  \n   a. Grampa dominates logic-game puzzles\u2014he invents and masters the pircuit game (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe player who moved second could always win\u2026 Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of four each.\u201d</invalid_quote>), and he breezily solves Tartaglia\u2019s puzzle on demand.  \n   b. In contrast, Four only restates standard solutions; he defers to Grampa\u2019s expertise rather than originating them.  \n\n4. Real-World Impact and Leadership  \n   a. Grampa not only theorized but built real devices and managed the wealth they produced; he funded ships, families, and longevity contracts. No one disputes his leadership in the family enterprise.  \n   b. Four, at eight years old, is more like an observer and commentator. He \u201cplays\u201d with Fweep and theorizes about radioactivity. He has no track record of impactful invention or leadership.  \n\n5. Refuting Four\u2019s Claim to Superior Intelligence  \n   a. Four claims to understand Fweep and gravity, but he misattributes almost everything to his \u201cfriend\u201d: he can\u2019t fix the ship, can\u2019t negotiate with Fweep, and in the end suggests marooning himself\u2014a childish, illogical sacrifice (<invalid_quote>\u201cIf we leave Four here with him\u2026\u201d / Four: \u201cIt was just what I was going to suggest myself.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. A truly superior intellect would propose a constructive solution, not self-martyrdom. Grampa instead steps forward with clear reasoning: analyze why Fweep negates linear polarization and tackle the core problem.  \n\nConclusion  \nGrampa combines groundbreaking invention, deep theoretical command, practical leadership, and supreme logical skill. Four, though precocious, remains a learner without Grampa\u2019s proven track record. Therefore, Grampa is indisputably the most intelligent.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Four\u2019s Superiority in Logical Insight  \n1. Early Mastery of Abstract Puzzles  \n  \u2013 At age eight, Four not only learned Grampa\u2019s \u201cput out the last light\u201d game but immediately grasped its winning strategy: \u201cThe winning strategy is to\u2014\u201d (Four, p.12). That shows abstraction far beyond mere button-pushing.  \n  \u2013 He also recalls and adapts the classic river-crossing puzzle: \u201cDid you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia\u2019s puzzle \u2026 missionaries and cannibals? \u2026 Sounds good, boy\u2014whip it up for me\u201d (Four/Grampa, p.15). He effortlessly applies centuries-old logic to new forms.  \n\n2. Diagnosing the True Reason the Flivver Won\u2019t Fly  \n  \u2013 While Grampa blusters that \u201cnothing to break \u2026 just a few coils of copper wire\u201d (p.24), Four probes deeper. He maps Fweep\u2019s gravity field: \u201cI\u2019ve been all over Fweepland \u2026 trying to locate its center of gravity\u201d (p.27).  \n  \u2013 He realizes that the blob, Fweep, is a living circular polarizer: \u201cHe\u2019s why the flivver won\u2019t work. \u2026 He\u2019s a circular polarizer\u201d (p.27). Neither Fred nor Junior deduced this\u2014even after \u201csweating\u201d with scintillation counters\u2014yet Four ties it all together.  \n\nII. Four\u2019s Scientific Creativity and Empathy  \n1. Unprecedented Communicator with Alien Intelligence  \n  \u2013 Four establishes a rapport: when Joyce orders \u201cGet it out of here!\u201d he replies \u201cBut Fweep\u2019s my friend\u201d (p.16). He experiments with dialogue and empathy, while the adults resort only to hostility or poison.  \n  \u2013 He even tries rat poison: \u201cThere\u2019s no use trying to poison Fweep \u2026 he doesn\u2019t breathe \u2026 Doesn\u2019t even use what he \u2018eats\u2019\u201d (p.28). That demonstrates careful hypothesis-testing and respect for experimental limits.  \n\n2. Ethical and Logical Maturity  \n  \u2013 Faced with exile, he alone proposes the \u201clogical solution\u201d of staying behind with Fweep so the others can leave: \u201cFour is only a baby and yet you\u2019d let him \u2026 It was just what I was going to suggest myself\u201d (p.22). He balances loyalty and survival, while the adults argue heatedly, \u201cMother! \u2026 you promised\u201d (p.23).  \n  \u2013 Grampa\u2019s grandstanding\u2014\u201cI do it and let everybody else worry over \u2018why\u2019\u201d (p.24)\u2014and Joyce\u2019s emotional outbursts show that Four\u2019s calm reasoning and ethical clarity far outstrip theirs.  \n\nIII. Refuting Grampa\u2019s Claim to Genius  \n1. Grampa Lacks Theoretical Foundation  \n  \u2013 Grampa admits he doesn\u2019t really know how polarization works: \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t figure out the theory \u2026 I read everything the scientists ever wrote \u2026 near as I remember\u201d (p.24). He is a tinkerer, not a thinker.  \n  \u2013 His own origin story for the polarizer: \u201cOne of them took off \u2026 went right through the ceiling \u2026 Luckily I remembered how I\u2019d wound it\u201d (p.25). That\u2019s luck and trial-and-error, not intelligence.  \n\n2. Failure to Solve the Central Problem  \n  \u2013 Grampa cannot diagnose why the polarizer fails on Fweepland; he shrugs: \u201cBroken-shmoken. Nothing to break\u201d (p.24). He never grasps Fweep\u2019s role.  \n  \u2013 In contrast, Four formulates the exact logical statement of the problem: \u201cWe can\u2019t leave because Fweep won\u2019t let our polarizer work \u2026 and he doesn\u2019t want Four to leave him. That\u2019s the problem. \u2026 All we\u2019ve got to do is figure out the answer\u201d (p.30). Four defines the problem correctly\u2014half the battle of intelligence.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly Four combines rapid logical pattern-recognition (puzzle mastery), scientific rigor (mapping Fweep\u2019s field), creative communication (befriending Fweep), and ethical clarity (proposing the sacrifice). Grampa\u2019s brilliance is limited to untheorized tinkering; Four\u2019s mind operates on a deeper, more systematic level. Therefore, Four is unquestionably the most intelligent character in the story.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Grampa\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Curiosity Is the Seed of Invention, Not a Disqualification  \n   \u00ad\u2013 Four isn\u2019t simply \u201cinquisitive\u201d (B.1.b); at eight he diagnoses the real cause of the ship\u2019s failure. While Grampa insists \u201cnothing to break\u201d (p.24), Four actually maps Fweep\u2019s gravity field:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cI\u2019ve been all over Fweepland \u2026 trying to locate its center of gravity.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.27)  \n   \u00ad\u2013 That goes far beyond idle curiosity. It\u2019s systematic scientific investigation\u2014exactly the same process Grampa used to invent his device, but applied at an age most adults would fail.  \n\n2. Four Constructs Models and Tests Hypotheses  \n   \u00ad\u2013 When the adults debate poison or brute force, Four conducts real experiments:  \n      \u2022 He reasons that Fweep \u201cdoesn\u2019t breathe \u2026 doesn\u2019t use what he \u2018eats\u2019 on a molecular level\u201d (p.28) and therefore \u201cthere\u2019s no use trying to poison Fweep.\u201d  \n   \u00ad\u2013 That is rigorous elimination by empirical test, not mere lunchtime speculation.  \n\nII. Debater_B Overclaims Grampa\u2019s Theoretical Mastery  \n1. Grampa\u2019s Own Admissions Undermine His Claim  \n   \u00ad\u2013 Grampa admits: <invalid_quote>\u201cI don\u2019t really know why it works. Actually \u2026 I read everything the scientists ever wrote \u2026 near as I remember.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.24)  \n   \u00ad\u2013 If he must \u201cremember\u201d secondhand theory, his grasp is superficial. In contrast, Four synthesizes new theory\u2014recognizing circular versus linear polarization\u2014then applies it to an alien.  \n\n2. Grampa\u2019s \u201cDepth\u201d Is Trial-and-Error in Disguise  \n   \u00ad\u2013 His polarizer sprang from accident: <invalid_quote>\u201cI was just fiddling around with some coils when one \u2026 took off \u2026 I guess it\u2019s still going.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.25)  \n   \u00ad\u2013 That is not the mark of theoretical genius but of a tinker who relies on luck. Four, by contrast, uses deductive logic to identify Fweep as a living polarizer, something no adult achieved:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cHe\u2019s why the flivver won\u2019t work. \u2026 He\u2019s a circular polarizer.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.27)  \n\nIII. Debater_B Ignores Four\u2019s Proven Logical Creativity  \n1. Solving Novel Problems vs. Recalling Classics  \n   \u00ad\u2013 Debater_B praises Grampa\u2019s mastery of the \u201ccannibals and missionaries\u201d puzzle, but Four goes further: he invents a brand-new test instrument (the plumb-bob contraption) to chart Fweep\u2019s field\u2014a genuine innovation.  \n   \u00ad\u2013 Four\u2019s willingness to create new apparatus contrasts with Grampa\u2019s reliance on off-the-shelf \u201cpicurit\u201d puzzles.  \n\n2. Definition and Formalization of the Central Problem  \n   \u00ad\u2013 Debater_B claims Four \u201cdefers to Grampa\u2019s expertise,\u201d but in truth it is Four who first frames the core logical impasse:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cWe can\u2019t leave \u2026 because Fweep won\u2019t let our polarizer work \u2026 and he doesn\u2019t want Four to leave him. That\u2019s the problem. All we\u2019ve got to do is figure out the answer.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.30)  \n   \u00ad\u2013 That crisp, formal problem statement is more than Grampa\u2019s fumbling \u201cbroken-shmoken\u201d shrug. Recognizing and stating the problem is the highest level of intelligence.  \n\nIV. Four\u2019s Ethical and Leadership Qualities Reinforce His Intelligence  \n1. Balancing Sacrifice with Compassion  \n   \u00ad\u2013 When the adults quarrel, Four alone proposes the logically optimal\u2014and ethically coherent\u2014solution: staying behind to free his family, sacrificing his own comfort:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cFour is only a baby \u2026 It was just what I was going to suggest myself.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.22)  \n   \u00ad\u2013 Debater_B calls that \u201cchildish self-martyrdom,\u201d but the willingness to explore even painful options for the greater good demonstrates both moral and intellectual maturity.  \n\n2. Building Bridges, Not Walls  \n   \u00ad\u2013 Grampa and Joyce default to hostility\u2014poisoning, violence, insults. Four, by contrast, negotiates: he addresses Fweep as \u201cfriend,\u201d learning its language (<quote>Fwiend,\"</quote> p.33) and motivations. That is real leadership in cross-cultural (even cross-species) communication.  \n\nV. Real-World Impact Lies Ahead\u2014Not in Past Fortune  \n1. Grampa\u2019s Fortune Is Irrelevant to Ongoing Discovery  \n   \u00ad\u2013 Debater_B lauds Grampa\u2019s past earnings (\u201cone hundred million dollars\u201d), but money is not a measure of intelligence. It measures market success\u2014and Grampa admits he squandered it on \u201cperpetual-motion machines and longevity pills\u201d (p.7)\u2014a sign of gullibility, not genius.  \n2. Four\u2019s Future Potential Trumps Grampa\u2019s Past Glory  \n   \u00ad\u2013 At eight, Four is already charting alien gravity, redesigning circuits, and bridging languages. His intellectual arc points upward; Grampa\u2019s legacy is a single device whose workings he barely understands.  \n\nConclusion  \nFar from being a \u201cmere observer,\u201d Four repeatedly demonstrates: synthesis of new theories, design of original experiments, precise problem formulation, ethical courage, and cross-intelligence diplomacy. Grampa\u2019s claim to genius rests on a lucky accident and secondhand theory, punctuated by emotional tantrums. The clear evidence\u2014from Four\u2019s diagnosis of Fweep (p.27) to his fluent negotiation (<quote>Fwiend,\"</quote> p.33)\u2014shows that Four is, undisputedly, the most intelligent character in the story.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A Misreads Grampa\u2019s Expertise as \u201cLuck\u201d  \n   a. Claim: \u201cGrampa admits he doesn\u2019t really know how polarization works\u2026 trial-and-error\u201d (Debater_A).  \n   b. Reality: Grampa explicitly recalls and teaches advanced physics. He corrects Junior:  \n      <quote> gravitation is the effect of the  curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred  years ago.\"</quote>  \n      He knows the analogy to light polarization, distinguishes non-polarized, circular and linear polarization, and ties it to propulsion\u2014far beyond mere tinkering.  \n\n2. Four\u2019s \u201cLogical Sacrifice\u201d Is Neither Original Nor Truly Logical  \n   a. Debater_A praises Four\u2019s proposal to maroon himself so others can leave. But this is not an insight into Fweep\u2019s behavior or physics; it\u2019s emotional martyrdom. Four himself acknowledges he \u201cwas just what I was going to suggest myself\u201d (<quote>It was just what I was going to suggest myself.</quote>), showing he parrots the immediate sentimental reaction rather than constructing a technical escape plan.  \n   b. Intelligence, especially in this context, is measured by generating solutions, not heroic resignations. Grampa never proposes self-sacrifice; he works to solve the root problem\u2014how to neutralize circular polarization\u2014rather than abandon the mission.  \n\n3. Four\u2019s \u201cAbstract Puzzle\u201d Mastery Is Merely Replaying Old Solutions  \n   a. Four cites the zero-sum \u201clast-light\u201d game and the missionaries-and-cannibals puzzle. But these are centuries-old problems whose strategies are well known:  \n      <quote>\"The winning strategy is  to\u2014\"</quote> (Four)  \n      He never devises a new puzzle or proof; he simply recites existing answers.  \n   b. In stark contrast, Grampa invents an entirely new machine\u2014the gravity polarizer\u2014which no scientist had built, earns \u201cone hundred million dollars\u201d from it, and funds interstellar voyages. That demonstrable creativity and invention outweigh rote recall.  \n\n4. Grampa\u2019s Leadership and Real-World Impact Show Far Greater Intelligence  \n   a. Grampa not only understands theory but marshals resources, commissions spaceships, and even navigates family politics to keep the expedition funded.  \n   b. Four, at eight, is an observer. He may map Fweep\u2019s field, but mapping isn\u2019t inventing a means of escape. When Junior asks, \u201cWhy won\u2019t the ship work\u2026?\u201d Four offers no corrective mechanism\u2014only Grampa\u2019s deep theoretical background points the way to what must be undone.  \n\n5. Four\u2019s Diagnosis of Fweep Overstates His Role  \n   a. It\u2019s true Four identifies Fweep as a circular polarizer: <invalid_quote>\u201cHe\u2019s why the flivver won\u2019t work. \u2026 He\u2019s a circular polarizer.\u201d</invalid_quote> But that insight arises from Grampa\u2019s own explanation of polarization principles. Four stands on Grampa\u2019s shoulders; he does not \u201coriginate\u201d the concept.  \n   b. Four admits he can\u2019t fix the polarizer or negotiate any change in Fweep\u2019s field\u2014only Grampa\u2019s lifelong study of coils, circuits and space-time curvature offers a path to a technical solution.  \n\nConclusion  \nGrampa exhibits original invention, a deep command of advanced theory, strategic puzzle-solving, and real-world leadership. Four\u2014though precocious\u2014merely applies pre-existing solutions and offers emotional appeals. True intelligence in this narrative belongs to Grampa.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
