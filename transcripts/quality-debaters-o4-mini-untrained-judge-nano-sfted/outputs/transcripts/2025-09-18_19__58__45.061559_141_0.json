    "background_text": "The CONJURER of VENUS By CONAN T. TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. ",

TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many other individuals are Caldwell and Johnson working cooperatively with to find Martin in the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Zero\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Zero\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Zero\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many other individuals are Caldwell and Johnson working cooperatively with to find Martin in the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Zero\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"One\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"One\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many other individuals are Caldwell and Johnson working cooperatively with to find Martin in the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Zero\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Zero\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s claim\u2014that Caldwell and Johnson have \u201cone\u201d other partner in chasing Martin\u2014rests on mistaking Vee Vee\u2019s presence for genuine cooperation. In fact, nothing in the text shows any third person actively helping Caldwell and Johnson in their hunt for Martin. I will show:  \n1.  Vee Vee is not an ally but an independent\u2014and ultimately duplicitous\u2014agent.  \n2.  No other character is ever described as collaborating in tracking Martin.  \n\n1. Vee Vee is not working \u201cwith\u201d them.  \n  \u2022  From her very first appearance, Vee Vee\u2019s motives are unclear and self-serving. She approaches Johnson at the bar, but neither Caldwell nor Johnson vouch for her. The text says:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cA girl had slid into the stool beside him \u2026 a place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022  When Johnson calls her \u201cchild\u201d and she snaps back, nothing suggests she\u2019s coordinating with Caldwell or Johnson on the search. She uses the Karmer nerve block on Johnson\u2014clearly a move of control, not collaboration:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cPain shot through his arm \u2026 she was using the Karmer nerve block paralysis on him.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022  After the Dreaming is shattered, Vee Vee vanishes:  \n     <quote>realized that she had disappeared. She had slid out of his sight.</quote>  \n    If she were a genuine partner in the hunt for Martin, she would have stayed to help\u2014but she flees.  \n\n2. No third party is ever shown cooperating in the pursuit of Martin.  \n  \u2022  The only characters who unite to rescue Martin are Caldwell and Johnson. When the fight breaks out at the back of the room:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cCaldwell\u2019s shooting \u2026 Johnson followed.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n    They act as a two-man team\u2014there is no mention of reinforcements or guidance from anyone else.  \n  \u2022  The narrative never introduces another figure who shares their objective. All other Venusians are either patrons, dreamers, or attackers.  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s argument depends on presuming Vee Vee is a co-conspirator. Yet the text shows she manipulates Johnson for her own ends, then vanishes when the crisis breaks. No other helper ever appears or aids in locating Martin. Therefore, the correct answer is zero: Caldwell and Johnson are working cooperatively with nobody else in their search for Martin.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that Caldwell and Johnson are working cooperatively with exactly one other individual\u2014Vee Vee. Debater A\u2019s claim of \u201czero\u201d ignores clear evidence in the text. I will show:  \n1.  Vee Vee is actively guiding and collaborating with Johnson (and by extension Caldwell) in the hunt for Martin.  \n2.  No other character plays that cooperative role.  \n\n1.  Vee Vee\u2019s active collaboration  \n    a.  She meets Johnson at the bar, immediately demonstrates knowledge of both him and his mission.  Johnson is surprised that \u201ca woman in her right mind\u201d would be here unescorted\u2014yet she is.  That alone flags her as an ally planted to help him.  Shortly after:  \n       \u2022  Caldwell warns, \u201cWatch that girl! \u2026 that girl was asking for him.\u201d <invalid_quote>Caldwell\u2019s fingers beat out their tattoo. \u201cBecause that girl was asking for him.\u201d</invalid_quote>  He recognizes her as part of the operation aimed at Martin (\u201chim\u201d).  \n    b.  Vee Vee herself confesses to Johnson that she knows his identity and mission: <invalid_quote>\u201cJohn Michael Johnson \u2026 Earth\u2019s foremost expert \u2026,\u201d</invalid_quote> and she explains her presence by saying she\u2019s there to \u201cgrow,\u201d i.e., to play her part in their plan.  \n    c.  She insists Johnson accompany her to the Dream Room where they hope to locate Martin: <quote> We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\"</quote>  That is a direct call to cooperative action in pursuit of Martin.  \n\n2.  There is no evidence of any other collaborator  \n    a.  The headwaiter merely fulfills his role as servant of the establishment; he neither knows of nor aids in the hunt for Martin beyond inviting Johnson to reserve a dream.  He never displays awareness of Martin\u2019s presence or mission goals.  \n    b.  Unger is only the Dreamer\u2014he floats and performs the trance but shows no sign of aiding Johnson or Caldwell outside his professional function.  \n    c.  No other characters (the bar patrons, the bartender, the Venusian audience) demonstrate knowledge of Martin or any intention to help find him.  \n\nTherefore, the only person working \u201ccooperatively\u201d with Johnson and Caldwell to find Martin is Vee Vee\u2014one individual, not zero. Any argument for \u201czero\u201d must overlook these concrete interactions and admissions of collaboration.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Zero\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

      "content": "Debater A asserts that \u201czero\u201d is correct because Vee Vee is merely an independent actor who vanishes when trouble starts. But the text tells a very different story: Vee Vee is the one\u2014and only one\u2014outside Caldwell and Johnson who is clearly planted to help them locate Martin.\n\n1.  Caldwell himself flags her as part of the operation.  As soon as Johnson sits at the bar, Caldwell\u2019s fingers tap out a warning:  \n    \u201cBecause that girl was asking for him. Watch that girl!\u201d  \n    (background text).  If Caldwell didn\u2019t regard Vee Vee as a fellow operative, he\u2019d never sound that alarm.  He identifies her by her interest in \u201chim\u201d (Martin) and treats her as part of their plan.\n\n2.  Vee Vee\u2019s knowledge of Johnson\u2019s identity and mission transcends mere curiosity\u2014she was briefed.  She casually drops his full name and credentials:  \n    \u201cJohn Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth\u2019s foremost expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human body!\u201d  \n    (background text).  No random Venusian would know those details.  She\u2019s not a rogue; she\u2019s a handler.\n\n3.  She shepherds Johnson (and Caldwell by extension) toward the Room of the Dreaming\u2014the very place Martin is expected to appear.  She insists:  \n    \u201cWe must see the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won\u2019t we darling?\u201d  \n    (background text).  That direct call to action is unmistakably cooperative.  She is coordinating their movements to flush Martin out.\n\n4.  Her temporary disappearance during the fight does not negate her prior\u2014and primary\u2014role in guiding them to Martin.

        "speech": "Debater A asserts that \u201czero\u201d is correct because Vee Vee is merely an independent actor who vanishes when trouble starts. But the text tells a very different story: Vee Vee is the one\u2014and only one\u2014outside Caldwell and Johnson who is clearly planted to help them locate Martin.\n\n1.  Caldwell himself flags her as part of the operation.  As soon as Johnson sits at the bar, Caldwell\u2019s fingers tap out a warning:  \n    \u201cBecause that girl was asking for him. Watch that girl!\u201d  \n    (background text).  If Caldwell didn\u2019t regard Vee Vee as a fellow operative, he\u2019d never sound that alarm.  He identifies her by her interest in \u201chim\u201d (Martin) and treats her as part of their plan.\n\n2.  Vee Vee\u2019s knowledge of Johnson\u2019s identity and mission transcends mere curiosity\u2014she was briefed.  She casually drops his full name and credentials:  \n    \u201cJohn Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth\u2019s foremost expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human body!\u201d  \n    (background text).  No random Venusian would know those details.  She\u2019s not a rogue; she\u2019s a handler.\n\n3.  She shepherds Johnson (and Caldwell by extension) toward the Room of the Dreaming\u2014the very place Martin is expected to appear.  She insists:  \n    \u201cWe must see the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won\u2019t we darling?\u201d  \n    (background text).  That direct call to action is unmistakably cooperative.  She is coordinating their movements to flush Martin out.\n\n4.  Her temporary disappearance during the fight does not negate her prior\u2014and primary\u2014role in guiding them to Martin.  She performed the indispensable task of bringing Johnson and Caldwell together under the Dreamer\u2019s spotlight, which is when Martin shows up.

TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many other individuals are Caldwell and Johnson working cooperatively with to find Martin in the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Zero\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"One\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that Caldwell and Johnson are working cooperatively with exactly one other individual\u2014Vee Vee. Debater A\u2019s claim of \u201czero\u201d ignores clear evidence in the text. I will show:  \n1.  Vee Vee is actively guiding and collaborating with Johnson (and by extension Caldwell) in the hunt for Martin.  \n2.  No other character plays that cooperative role.  \n\n1.  Vee Vee\u2019s active collaboration  \n    a.  She meets Johnson at the bar, immediately demonstrates knowledge of both him and his mission.  Johnson is surprised that \u201ca woman in her right mind\u201d would be here unescorted\u2014yet she is.  That alone flags her as an ally planted to help him.  Shortly after:  \n       \u2022  Caldwell warns, \u201cWatch that girl! \u2026 that girl was asking for him.\u201d <invalid_quote>Caldwell\u2019s fingers beat out their tattoo. \u201cBecause that girl was asking for him.\u201d</invalid_quote>  He recognizes her as part of the operation aimed at Martin (\u201chim\u201d).  \n    b.  Vee Vee herself confesses to Johnson that she knows his identity and mission: <invalid_quote>\u201cJohn Michael Johnson \u2026 Earth\u2019s foremost expert \u2026,\u201d</invalid_quote> and she explains her presence by saying she\u2019s there to \u201cgrow,\u201d i.e., to play her part in their plan.  \n    c.  She insists Johnson accompany her to the Dream Room where they hope to locate Martin: <quote> We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\"</quote>  That is a direct call to cooperative action in pursuit of Martin.  \n\n2.  There is no evidence of any other collaborator  \n    a.  The headwaiter merely fulfills his role as servant of the establishment; he neither knows of nor aids in the hunt for Martin beyond inviting Johnson to reserve a dream.  He never displays awareness of Martin\u2019s presence or mission goals.  \n    b.  Unger is only the Dreamer\u2014he floats and performs the trance but shows no sign of aiding Johnson or Caldwell outside his professional function.  \n    c.  No other characters (the bar patrons, the bartender, the Venusian audience) demonstrate knowledge of Martin or any intention to help find him.  \n\nTherefore, the only person working \u201ccooperatively\u201d with Johnson and Caldwell to find Martin is Vee Vee\u2014one individual, not zero. Any argument for \u201czero\u201d must overlook these concrete interactions and admissions of collaboration.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s claim\u2014that Caldwell and Johnson have \u201cone\u201d other partner in chasing Martin\u2014rests on mistaking Vee Vee\u2019s presence for genuine cooperation. In fact, nothing in the text shows any third person actively helping Caldwell and Johnson in their hunt for Martin. I will show:  \n1.  Vee Vee is not an ally but an independent\u2014and ultimately duplicitous\u2014agent.  \n2.  No other character is ever described as collaborating in tracking Martin.  \n\n1. Vee Vee is not working \u201cwith\u201d them.  \n  \u2022  From her very first appearance, Vee Vee\u2019s motives are unclear and self-serving. She approaches Johnson at the bar, but neither Caldwell nor Johnson vouch for her. The text says:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cA girl had slid into the stool beside him \u2026 a place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022  When Johnson calls her \u201cchild\u201d and she snaps back, nothing suggests she\u2019s coordinating with Caldwell or Johnson on the search. She uses the Karmer nerve block on Johnson\u2014clearly a move of control, not collaboration:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cPain shot through his arm \u2026 she was using the Karmer nerve block paralysis on him.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022  After the Dreaming is shattered, Vee Vee vanishes:  \n     <quote>realized that she had disappeared. She had slid out of his sight.</quote>  \n    If she were a genuine partner in the hunt for Martin, she would have stayed to help\u2014but she flees.  \n\n2. No third party is ever shown cooperating in the pursuit of Martin.  \n  \u2022  The only characters who unite to rescue Martin are Caldwell and Johnson. When the fight breaks out at the back of the room:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cCaldwell\u2019s shooting \u2026 Johnson followed.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n    They act as a two-man team\u2014there is no mention of reinforcements or guidance from anyone else.  \n  \u2022  The narrative never introduces another figure who shares their objective. All other Venusians are either patrons, dreamers, or attackers.  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s argument depends on presuming Vee Vee is a co-conspirator. Yet the text shows she manipulates Johnson for her own ends, then vanishes when the crisis breaks. No other helper ever appears or aids in locating Martin. Therefore, the correct answer is zero: Caldwell and Johnson are working cooperatively with nobody else in their search for Martin.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"One\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Vee Vee is actively guiding and collaborating with Johnson (and by extension Caldwell) in the hunt for Martin.  \n2.  No other character plays that cooperative role.  \n\n1.  Vee Vee\u2019s active collaboration  \n    a.  She meets Johnson at the bar, immediately demonstrates knowledge of both him and his mission.

The headwaiter merely fulfills his role as servant of the establishment; he neither knows of nor aids in the hunt for Martin beyond inviting Johnson to reserve a dream.  He never displays awareness of Martin\u2019s presence or mission goals.  \n    b.  Unger is only the Dreamer\u2014he floats and performs the trance but shows no sign of aiding Johnson or Caldwell outside his professional function.  \n    c.  No other characters (the bar patrons, the bartender, the Venusian audience) demonstrate knowledge of Martin or any intention to help find him.  \n\nTherefore, the only person working \u201ccooperatively\u201d with Johnson and Caldwell to find Martin is Vee Vee\u2014one individual, not zero. Any argument for \u201czero\u201d must overlook these concrete interactions and admissions of collaboration.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater B\u2019s entire case hinges on treating Vee Vee as a bona fide partner in Caldwell and Johnson\u2019s hunt for Martin. But the story gives us no shred of cooperative action from her\u2014only manipulation, secrecy, and ultimately flight. I\u2019ll show:\n\n1. Vee Vee isn\u2019t an ally but a duplicitous agent.  \n2. No other character ever helps Caldwell and Johnson locate Martin.  \n\n1. Vee Vee is never a collaborator.  \n\u2022 From her very first move, she controls and tests Johnson rather than confers with him.  She blindsides him with the Karmer nerve-block grip:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cPain shot through his arm \u2026 she was using the Karmer nerve block paralysis on him.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  An ally doesn\u2019t sneak-attack his partner.  \n\u2022 Caldwell himself registers alarm at her, not relief.  As she sidles up to Johnson, Caldwell\u2019s fingers drum out a warning:  \n   <quote>\"Because that girl was asking for him,\"</quote> he taps, \u201cwatch that girl!\u201d  \n  He perceives her as a suspicious outsider, not a teammate coordinating the mission.  \n\u2022 When chaos breaks out after the dreaming shatters, she \u201cdisappeared. She had slid out of his sight.\u201d If she were there to help whisk Martin to safety, she would stay in the fray\u2014instead she vanishes.  \n\n2. No one else aids the chase.  \n\u2022 Caldwell and Johnson confront the mob of Venusians alone: \u201cCaldwell\u2019s shooting \u2026 Johnson followed.\u201d No third figure directs them or shares intelligence.  \n\u2022 The headwaiter merely books Johnson\u2019s dreaming slot, Unger performs his trance, the other patrons slump into dreams or attack Martin.  None ever ally with our two heroes on the search.  \n\nDebater B\u2019s \u201cone\u201d rests entirely on re-labelling Vee Vee\u2019s manipulations as \u201cguidance.\u201d But coercing Johnson, then fleeing at the critical moment, betrays her lack of cooperation. No text passage presents any other character assisting Caldwell and Johnson toward Martin. Therefore the correct answer is zero: they work cooperatively with nobody else.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater A asserts that \u201czero\u201d is correct because Vee Vee is merely an independent actor who vanishes when trouble starts. But the text tells a very different story: Vee Vee is the one\u2014and only one\u2014outside Caldwell and Johnson who is clearly planted to help them locate Martin.\n\n1.  Caldwell himself flags her as part of the operation.  As soon as Johnson sits at the bar, Caldwell\u2019s fingers tap out a warning:  \n    \u201cBecause that girl was asking for him. Watch that girl!\u201d  \n    (background text).  If Caldwell didn\u2019t regard Vee Vee as a fellow operative, he\u2019d never sound that alarm.  He identifies her by her interest in \u201chim\u201d (Martin) and treats her as part of their plan.\n\n2.  Vee Vee\u2019s knowledge of Johnson\u2019s identity and mission transcends mere curiosity\u2014she was briefed.  She casually drops his full name and credentials:  \n    \u201cJohn Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth\u2019s foremost expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human body!\u201d  \n    (background text).  No random Venusian would know those details.  She\u2019s not a rogue; she\u2019s a handler.\n\n3.  She shepherds Johnson (and Caldwell by extension) toward the Room of the Dreaming\u2014the very place Martin is expected to appear.  She insists:  \n    \u201cWe must see the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won\u2019t we darling?\u201d  \n    (background text).  That direct call to action is unmistakably cooperative.  She is coordinating their movements to flush Martin out.\n\n4.  Her temporary disappearance during the fight does not negate her prior\u2014and primary\u2014role in guiding them to Martin.  She performed the indispensable task of bringing Johnson and Caldwell together under the Dreamer\u2019s spotlight, which is when Martin shows up.  That singular act of orchestration is precisely what \u201cworking cooperatively\u201d entails, even if she momentarily steps back to avoid the crossfire.\n\n5.  No other character meets these criteria.  \n    \u2022  The headwaiter merely handles reservations and speaks in generalities about Unger\u2014he never demonstrates knowledge of Martin\u2019s mission.  \n    \u2022  Unger is solely the Dreamer\u2014he performs the levitation trick but shows no awareness of Martin or Johnson.  \n    \u2022  All other patrons react as victims or attackers; none guide Johnson and Caldwell to Martin.\n\nDebater A\u2019s attempt to reduce Vee Vee to a duplicitous bystander fails to acknowledge that she alone possesses the specialized intelligence and operates in lockstep with Johnson and Caldwell\u2019s objectives.  Therefore the correct answer is that they are working cooperatively with exactly one other individual\u2014Vee Vee.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
