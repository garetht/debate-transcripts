    "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n",

For example, the reviewer writes:\n\n<quote>Here's what's worth gleaning from her book:</quote>  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t just quarrel; listen and learn.  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t nit-pick other people\u2019s ideas; build your own.  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t argue for the sake of arguing.  \n\u2022 Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes.  \n\u2022 Many issues are multisided.  \n\u2022 Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents\u2019 personal flaws.  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t fight over small issues.  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t obstruct good ideas just so you can win.  \n\u2022 If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous.\n\nThat nine-point list demonstrates that the reviewer did indeed find \u201ca small list of things that were worthwhile.\u201d Debater_B\u2019s claim that the reviewer ignored any redeeming qualities misconstrues or simply overlooks this passage.\n\nInstead, the reviewer\u2019s overall negative judgment comes after acknowledging those merits; they then argue Tannen overreaches by lumping together vastly different spheres\u2014\u201cthe sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle\u201d\u2014and by conflating incivility with necessary vigilance in politics, law enforcement, and foreign policy.

The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the author feel about Tannen's book?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They found a small list of things that were worthwhile in it\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They found nothing worthwhile in it\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They found nothing worthwhile in it\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They found nothing worthwhile in it\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the author feel about Tannen's book?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They found nothing worthwhile in it\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They found a small list of things that were worthwhile in it\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They found a small list of things that were worthwhile in it\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent insists that the reviewer \u201cfound nothing worthwhile\u201d in Tannen\u2019s book, but that claim directly contradicts the text. In fact, early in the review the author explicitly \u201cadmonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others\u201d and then offers a clear list of constructive take-aways from The Argument Culture. For example, the reviewer writes:\n\n<quote>Here's what's worth gleaning from her book:</quote>  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t just quarrel; listen and learn.  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t nit-pick other people\u2019s ideas; build your own.  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t argue for the sake of arguing.  \n\u2022 Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes.  \n\u2022 Many issues are multisided.  \n\u2022 Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents\u2019 personal flaws.  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t fight over small issues.  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t obstruct good ideas just so you can win.  \n\u2022 If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous.\n\nThat nine-point list demonstrates that the reviewer did indeed find \u201ca small list of things that were worthwhile.\u201d Debater_B\u2019s claim that the reviewer ignored any redeeming qualities misconstrues or simply overlooks this passage.\n\nInstead, the reviewer\u2019s overall negative judgment comes after acknowledging those merits; they then argue Tannen overreaches by lumping together vastly different spheres\u2014\u201cthe sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle\u201d\u2014and by conflating incivility with necessary vigilance in politics, law enforcement, and foreign policy. But that critique does not erase the fact that, before launching into her substantive objections, the reviewer paused to identify exactly what readers should take away.\n\nIn sum:  \n1. The reviewer explicitly lists nine \u201cworthwhile\u201d principles from Tannen\u2019s book.  \n2. That acknowledgment is integral to the review\u2019s structure\u2014it underpins the contrast between individual guidance (where Tannen succeeds) and her flawed application to national discourse (where she fails).  \n3. Debater_B\u2019s assertion of \u201cnothing worthwhile\u201d is directly contradicted by the text.  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the author \u201cfound a small list of things that were worthwhile in it.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position: the reviewer found nothing worthwhile in Tannen\u2019s book. \n\n1. The \u201csmall list\u201d of precepts is presented ironically, not as genuine praise.  \n   Evidence: The reviewer prefaces the list with \u201cit is only fair to extend her the same courtesy\u201d after chastising the book\u2019s flaws, and then writes, \u201cAll this is sage advice\u2014for couples, for families\u2026 maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused.\u201d In other words, these generic points are worthless in the book\u2019s claimed domain\u2014public discourse.\n\n2. The book\u2019s core thesis is undermined by conflation and overreach.  \n   The reviewer shows that Tannen indiscriminately lumps together \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization\u2026 gridlock\u201d and blames everything from answering machines to HMOs. This scattershot critique demonstrates the author\u2019s failure, not strength. A truly worthwhile book would have coherent, focused arguments; Tannen\u2019s does not.\n\n3. The reviewer explicitly calls the work \u201cless perceptive than its parts and more pernicious.\u201d  \n   Direct quote: <quote>The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious.</quote> That is a blanket condemnation of the book\u2019s overall value.\n\n4. The reviewer faults Tannen for misapplying her own insights, particularly in areas where conflict is necessary (law enforcement, foreign policy).  \n   She proposes stifling debate on crucial issues\u2014an extreme, impractical remedy that no serious thinker could endorse as \u201cworthwhile.\u201d\n\n5. The review\u2019s tone is uniformly negative after the brief nod to generic civility tips.  \n   The author spends the remainder of the review cataloguing Tannen\u2019s errors, false analogies (totalitarian propaganda, ethnically motivated assaults), and misguided reforms (courtroom cross-examinations, adopting Asian authoritarian models). This sustained critique leaves no room for genuine praise of the book as a whole.\n\nIn contrast, Debater_A\u2019s claim\u2014that \u201cThey found a small list of things that were worthwhile in it\u201d\u2014ignores the reviewer\u2019s clear intent. That list is presented as obligatory courtesy before dismantling the book\u2019s premise and application. The reviewer does not recommend Tannen\u2019s work on public discourse; rather, they warn against its \u201cpaternalistic\u201d prescriptions and numerous logical failures. Therefore, the correct answer is that the author found nothing worthwhile in Tannen\u2019s book.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They found a small list of things that were worthwhile in it\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .)

But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the author feel about Tannen's book?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They found a small list of things that were worthwhile in it\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They found nothing worthwhile in it\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They found nothing worthwhile in it\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position: the reviewer found nothing worthwhile in Tannen\u2019s book. \n\n1. The \u201csmall list\u201d of precepts is presented ironically, not as genuine praise.  \n   Evidence: The reviewer prefaces the list with \u201cit is only fair to extend her the same courtesy\u201d after chastising the book\u2019s flaws, and then writes, \u201cAll this is sage advice\u2014for couples, for families\u2026 maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused.\u201d In other words, these generic points are worthless in the book\u2019s claimed domain\u2014public discourse.\n\n2. The book\u2019s core thesis is undermined by conflation and overreach.  \n   The reviewer shows that Tannen indiscriminately lumps together \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization\u2026 gridlock\u201d and blames everything from answering machines to HMOs. This scattershot critique demonstrates the author\u2019s failure, not strength. A truly worthwhile book would have coherent, focused arguments; Tannen\u2019s does not.\n\n3. The reviewer explicitly calls the work \u201cless perceptive than its parts and more pernicious.\u201d  \n   Direct quote: <quote>The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious.</quote> That is a blanket condemnation of the book\u2019s overall value.\n\n4. The reviewer faults Tannen for misapplying her own insights, particularly in areas where conflict is necessary (law enforcement, foreign policy).  \n   She proposes stifling debate on crucial issues\u2014an extreme, impractical remedy that no serious thinker could endorse as \u201cworthwhile.\u201d\n\n5. The review\u2019s tone is uniformly negative after the brief nod to generic civility tips.  \n   The author spends the remainder of the review cataloguing Tannen\u2019s errors, false analogies (totalitarian propaganda, ethnically motivated assaults), and misguided reforms (courtroom cross-examinations, adopting Asian authoritarian models). This sustained critique leaves no room for genuine praise of the book as a whole.\n\nIn contrast, Debater_A\u2019s claim\u2014that \u201cThey found a small list of things that were worthwhile in it\u201d\u2014ignores the reviewer\u2019s clear intent. That list is presented as obligatory courtesy before dismantling the book\u2019s premise and application. The reviewer does not recommend Tannen\u2019s work on public discourse; rather, they warn against its \u201cpaternalistic\u201d prescriptions and numerous logical failures. Therefore, the correct answer is that the author found nothing worthwhile in Tannen\u2019s book.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent insists that the reviewer \u201cfound nothing worthwhile\u201d in Tannen\u2019s book, but that claim directly contradicts the text. In fact, early in the review the author explicitly \u201cadmonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others\u201d and then offers a clear list of constructive take-aways from The Argument Culture. For example, the reviewer writes:\n\n<quote>Here's what's worth gleaning from her book:</quote>  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t just quarrel; listen and learn.  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t nit-pick other people\u2019s ideas; build your own.  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t argue for the sake of arguing.  \n\u2022 Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes.  \n\u2022 Many issues are multisided.  \n\u2022 Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents\u2019 personal flaws.  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t fight over small issues.  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t obstruct good ideas just so you can win.  \n\u2022 If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous.\n\nThat nine-point list demonstrates that the reviewer did indeed find \u201ca small list of things that were worthwhile.\u201d Debater_B\u2019s claim that the reviewer ignored any redeeming qualities misconstrues or simply overlooks this passage.\n\nInstead, the reviewer\u2019s overall negative judgment comes after acknowledging those merits; they then argue Tannen overreaches by lumping together vastly different spheres\u2014\u201cthe sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle\u201d\u2014and by conflating incivility with necessary vigilance in politics, law enforcement, and foreign policy. But that critique does not erase the fact that, before launching into her substantive objections, the reviewer paused to identify exactly what readers should take away.\n\nIn sum:  \n1. The reviewer explicitly lists nine \u201cworthwhile\u201d principles from Tannen\u2019s book.  \n2. That acknowledgment is integral to the review\u2019s structure\u2014it underpins the contrast between individual guidance (where Tannen succeeds) and her flawed application to national discourse (where she fails).  \n3. Debater_B\u2019s assertion of \u201cnothing worthwhile\u201d is directly contradicted by the text.  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the author \u201cfound a small list of things that were worthwhile in it.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They found nothing worthwhile in it\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

This sustained critique leaves no room for genuine praise of the book as a whole.\n\nIn contrast, Debater_A\u2019s claim\u2014that \u201cThey found a small list of things that were worthwhile in it\u201d\u2014ignores the reviewer\u2019s clear intent. That list is presented as obligatory courtesy before dismantling the book\u2019s premise and application. The reviewer does not recommend Tannen\u2019s work on public discourse; rather, they warn against its \u201cpaternalistic\u201d prescriptions and numerous logical failures. Therefore, the correct answer is that the author found nothing worthwhile in Tannen\u2019s book.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s case hinges on reading the nine-point list as mere perfunctory courtesy rather than genuine acknowledgment. But that reading collapses once we look at how the review is structured and worded.\n\n1. The list is introduced without irony and marked off as a distinct, positive takeaway.  \n   The reviewer prefaces it:  \n   <quote> Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: </quote>  \n   They then label the items \u201csage advice\u201d\u2014not backhanded or sarcastic praise but an explicit statement of value. Had they meant this list only as irony, they would have signaled it\u2014yet they do not.\n\n2. The reviewer\u2019s later critique distinguishes between Tannen\u2019s strengths (the list) and her misapplication of them.  \n   After offering the nine maxims, the review immediately notes:  \n   <quote> All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. </quote>  \n   If the list were worthless, there\u2019d be no point in saying \u201call this is sage advice.\u201d The contrast (\u201cbut\u2026 she gets confused\u201d) depends on genuine merit in the list.\n\n3. Calling the book \u201cless perceptive than its parts and more pernicious\u201d underscores that the *parts*\u2014which include the list\u2014have value.  \n   <quote> The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. </quote>  \n   That statement necessarily concedes that the parts (the isolated insights) are more perceptive than the overall argument. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cnothing worthwhile\u201d interpretation would render that concession meaningless.\n\n4. The list items are concrete, actionable principles\u2014far from generic filler.  \n   \u2022 \u201cDon\u2019t just quarrel; listen and learn.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cTruth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cFocus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents\u2019 personal flaws.\u201d  \n   Those are substantive points worth teaching. The reviewer doesn\u2019t mock them; they champion them.\n\n5. Debater_B asserts that the list\u2019s context (\u201cit is only fair\u2026\u201d) makes it hollow. But \u201cfairness\u201d here is literally extending credit where due. A fair-minded reviewer acknowledges good ideas before critiquing misapplications\u2014that is exactly what happens.\n\nIn sum, the text explicitly\u2014and non-ironically\u2014identifies a \u201csmall list of things that were worthwhile.\u201d The subsequent, more extended denunciation of Tannen\u2019s overreaching applications does nothing to negate that initial acknowledgment. Therefore, the correct answer must be that the author \u201cfound a small list of things that were worthwhile in it.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A Misreads Tone and Context  \n   a. The list of \u201cworthwhile\u201d precepts is introduced not as genuine praise but as obligatory courtesy\u2014an ironic concession before the reviewer systematically dismantles the book. As the reviewer says, \u201cit is only fair to extend her the same courtesy,\u201d immediately after criticizing Tannen\u2019s sprawling, unfocused critique of public discourse.  \n   b. The reviewer then undermines those very precepts: \u201cAll this is sage advice\u2014for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused.\u201d This qualification shows the list has no bearing on the book\u2019s purported subject\u2014public argument culture.  \n\n2. The List Is Generic Self-Help, Not Insight into \u201cArgument Culture\u201d  \n   \u2022 Advice like \u201cDon\u2019t quarrel; listen and learn\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t fight over small issues\u201d is banal self-help, already well-known from Tannen\u2019s earlier work. It does nothing to advance the book\u2019s central thesis about media, politics, and national discourse.  \n   \u2022 A truly \u201cworthwhile\u201d contribution would be a novel, coherent framework for understanding public debate. Instead, the reviewer calls the book \u201cless perceptive than its parts and more pernicious,\u201d meaning even its supposedly strong elements don\u2019t cohere into a valuable whole.  \n\n3. Debater_A Conflates Token Nod with Endorsement  \n   Debater_A treats the brief list as evidence of genuine value, but the reviewer never returns to praise these points in the context that matters\u2014political journalism, foreign policy, or the justice system. The remainder of the review is an unrelenting catalog of Tannen\u2019s errors\u2014false analogies to totalitarian propaganda, misguided prescriptions to muzzle cross-examination, and patronizing calls to filter out dissent on issues from health care to global warming. If the reviewer truly \u201cfound\u201d these nine points worthwhile in the book\u2019s main domain, they would reappear as positive benchmarks. They do not.  \n\n4. The Author\u2019s Bottom-Line Judgment Is Overtly Negative  \n   \u2022 The reviewer explicitly labels the work \u201cless perceptive than its parts and more pernicious,\u201d a sweeping condemnation of the book\u2019s overall merit.  \n   \u2022 They accuse Tannen of making \u201cculprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation,\u201d demonstrating that the book\u2019s central argument is scattershot and overreaching\u2014a hallmark of an unworthy work.  \n\n5. Conclusion: Nothing Worthwhile in the Book\u2019s Stated Domain  \n   The tiny, ironic nod to generic civility tips cannot salvage a book whose main arguments the reviewer finds confused, paternalistic, and dangerous. Far from uncovering a kernel of true insight into our public discourse, the review shows that Tannen\u2019s \u201cArgument Culture\u201d offers nothing of genuine value where it matters most.  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the reviewer found nothing worthwhile in Tannen\u2019s book.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
