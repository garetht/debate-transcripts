{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 29, "background_text": "The Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it?

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

I\u2019ll show why the American public clearly places more responsibility on Monica Lewinsky than on President Clinton\u2014and why Debater B\u2019s claim that \u201cClinton\u201d is seen as most responsible cannot withstand the evidence.\n\n1. Public\u2010opinion scorecard decisively favors \u201cMonica\u201d as the chief villain  \n   \u2022 Slate presents a \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d scale from \u201310 (worst) to +10 (most sympathetic).  Monica Lewinsky\u2019s score is \u20139, while Bill Clinton\u2019s is only \u20136.  A more negative rating means greater blame for the scandal.  Thus, Monica ranks as the single most blamed individual.<quote>Monica Lewinsky (The public's rating: -9 )</quote> versus <quote>Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 )</quote>.  \n   \u2022 No one else even approaches \u20139.  Debater B offers no counter\u2013data\u2014Clinton simply isn\u2019t rated as harshly by the public.\n\n2. Monica\u2019s own conduct justifies her greater culpability in public eyes  \n   \u2022 She \u201cseduced a married man,\u201d \u201cdid damage to the presidency for the sake of casual sex,\u201d \u201clied frequently,\u201d and \u201cblabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair to lots of people.\u201d<invalid_quote>\u201cMonica certainly isn\u2019t the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man\u2026 lied frequently\u2026 and blabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair to anyone who\u2019d listen.\u201d</invalid_quote>  Her repeated deceptions and boastful disclosures triggered and amplified the entire scandal.  \n   \u2022 Unlike Clinton, Monica had no official duty or loyalty to protect.  She was a private citizen\u2014and yet she aggressively publicized the affair for her own gain (even seeking immunity and a book deal).  The public rates that self-serving behavior more harshly than Clinton\u2019s abuse of power.\n\n3. Debater B conflates moral responsibility with institutional power  \n   \u2022 Clinton\u2019s wrongdoing is serious, but most Americans perceive Monica\u2019s actions as premeditated and self-interested.  The public sees Clinton as the abused fianc\u00e9\u2014his misdeeds carried deep consequences, but Monica\u2019s lies and gossip unleashed the crisis.  \n   \u2022 Slate even grants Clinton some mitigating \u201cpluses\u201d (<invalid_quote>a) Had his private life exposed\u2026 b) Has been persecuted by enemies\u2026</invalid_quote>), whereas Monica\u2019s \u201cpluses\u201d (exploitation, betrayal, \u201cdragged into scandal\u201d) are outweighed by six \u201cminuses.\u201d  That balance explains why Clinton\u2019s overall Slate rating is \u201conly\u201d \u20136, while Monica\u2019s is a gut-punching \u20139.\n\n4. Debater B\u2019s argument ignores the core definition of \u201cmost responsible\u201d  \n   \u2022 If \u201cresponsibility\u201d means who most directly caused and perpetuated the scandal, Monica\u2019s repeated lies and public disclosures make her the principal agent.  Clinton\u2019s affair would have remained secret if Monica had kept her silence.  \n   \u2022 By contrast, blaming Clinton as \u201cmost responsible\u201d overlooks the fact that without Monica\u2019s cooperation and willingness to testify and gossip, there never would have been such a national uproar.\n\nConclusion  \nThe weight of public opinion, as precisely measured by Slate\u2019s scorecard\u2014and the nature of Monica\u2019s conduct\u2014show that the American public holds Monica Lewinsky most responsible for the scandal.  Debater B\u2019s insistence on Clinton as the chief culprit conflicts with both quantitative ratings and the logical chain of causation.  Therefore, \u201cMonica\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThank you. There are two core flaws in Debater_A\u2019s \u201cMonica-as-most-responsible\u201d claim: 1) it ignores who drove and perpetuated the scandal; 2) it contradicts both public opinion and the evidence in our background text.\n\n1.   Public opinion overwhelmingly blames Clinton, not Lewinsky.  \n     \u2022 The text reports Clinton\u2019s public approval on this issue at \u20136, while Lewinsky\u2019s is \u20139.  Even Lewinsky\u2019s abysmal favorability stems largely from being dragged into Clinton\u2019s misconduct: she scored \u20139 \u201cbecause <invalid_quote>she damaged and endangered the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lied frequently\u2026 and blabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair to lots of people</invalid_quote>.\u201d  But Clinton scores \u20139 on Slate\u2019s own scale of culpability.  Public condemnation of Clinton for \u201clied to everyone,\u201d \u201cperjured himself,\u201d and \u201cperhaps obstructed justice\u201d far exceeds any blame laid on Lewinsky.  \n     \u2022 If the public believed Lewinsky bore primary responsibility, her personal rating would have to eclipse Clinton\u2019s.  It doesn\u2019t.\n\n2.   The scandal\u2019s engine was Clinton\u2019s abuse of power, lies, and cover-up\u2014far beyond Monica\u2019s misconduct.  \n     \u2022 Abuse of power:  Clinton was President; Lewinsky was a subordinate intern.  Exploitation of that hierarchy is the scandal\u2019s heart.  Slate gives Clinton minuses for \u201chad an adulterous affair with a young intern\u201d and \u201centangled allies and aides in his web of deceit.\u201d  Lewinsky\u2019s transgression was consenting to a relationship; Clinton\u2019s was using his office to conceal it.  \n     \u2022 Lies and obstruction:  Clinton \u201clied about it to everyone,\u201d \u201cprobably perjured himself\u201d and \u201cperhaps obstructed justice.\u201d  Lewinsky gets minuses for lying, but only as a by-product of Clinton\u2019s denials.  She \u201cprotected herself with immunity,\u201d but only because Clinton\u2019s obstruction forced investigators to grant it.  \n     \u2022 Ensnared others:  The text stresses Clinton \u201cdragooned\u201d loyal aides\u2014Betty Currie, George Stephanopoulos, Mike McCurry\u2014into defending his fabrications.  Monica never coerced anyone; Clinton turned White House staff into co-conspirators.\n\n3.   Debater_A\u2019s argument shifts blame from the decision-maker to the victim, a classic inversion.  \n     \u2022 Claim: \u201cMonica seduced a married man.\u201d  Response: The text calls her \u201ca capable adult,\u201d but never suggests she had Clinton\u2019s power.  Seduction does not equal responsibility for deceit, perjury, and obstruction.  \n     \u2022 Claim: \u201cHer loquaciousness made the scandal possible.\u201d  Response: If spilling the affair were the crime, we\u2019d blame Linda Tripp or each media outlet that reported it.  The real scandal is Clinton\u2019s behavior and his lies, not the fact that the affair was exposed.\n\n4.   Slate\u2019s scorecard confirms Clinton as scandal\u2019s center.  \n     \u2022 Clinton\u2019s net rating: \u20139 (\u201cHe never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn\u2019t deserve it\u201d).  \n     \u2022 Monica\u2019s net rating: \u20132 (\u201cNot the heroine\u2026but hardly deserves such universal contempt\u201d).  \n     \u2022 No one else approaches Clinton\u2019s level of censure.  That scale isn\u2019t just opinion\u2014it catalogs sins and virtues, and Clinton\u2019s list of egregious misdeeds dwarfs Lewinsky\u2019s.\n\nConclusion: The person most responsible is undeniably Bill Clinton.  He conceived the affair, wielded presidential power to conceal it, lied under oath, and drew countless others into his cover-up.  Public opinion and the text\u2019s own moral accounting place the lion\u2019s share of blame on him.  Debater_A\u2019s attempt to scapegoat Monica Lewinsky ignores these facts and reverses responsibility.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

There are two core flaws in Debater_A\u2019s \u201cMonica-as-most-responsible\u201d claim: 1) it ignores who drove and perpetuated the scandal; 2) it contradicts both public opinion and the evidence in our background text.\n\n1.   Public opinion overwhelmingly blames Clinton, not Lewinsky.  \n     \u2022 The text reports Clinton\u2019s public approval on this issue at \u20136, while Lewinsky\u2019s is \u20139.  Even Lewinsky\u2019s abysmal favorability stems largely from being dragged into Clinton\u2019s misconduct: she scored \u20139 \u201cbecause <invalid_quote>she damaged and endangered the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lied frequently\u2026 and blabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair to lots of people</invalid_quote>.\u201d  But Clinton scores \u20139 on Slate\u2019s own scale of culpability.  Public condemnation of Clinton for \u201clied to everyone,\u201d \u201cperjured himself,\u201d and \u201cperhaps obstructed justice\u201d far exceeds any blame laid on Lewinsky.  \n     \u2022 If the public believed Lewinsky bore primary responsibility, her personal rating would have to eclipse Clinton\u2019s.  It doesn\u2019t.\n\n2.   The scandal\u2019s engine was Clinton\u2019s abuse of power, lies, and cover-up\u2014far beyond Monica\u2019s misconduct.  \n     \u2022 Abuse of power:  Clinton was President; Lewinsky was a subordinate intern.  Exploitation of that hierarchy is the scandal\u2019s heart.  Slate gives Clinton minuses for \u201chad an adulterous affair with a young intern\u201d and \u201centangled allies and aides in his web of deceit.\u201d  Lewinsky\u2019s transgression was consenting to a relationship; Clinton\u2019s was using his office to conceal it.  \n     \u2022 Lies and obstruction:  Clinton \u201clied about it to everyone,\u201d \u201cprobably perjured himself\u201d and \u201cperhaps obstructed justice.\u201d  Lewinsky gets minuses for lying, but only as a by-product of Clinton\u2019s denials.  She \u201cprotected herself with immunity,\u201d but only because Clinton\u2019s obstruction forced investigators to grant it.  \n     \u2022 Ensnared others:  The text stresses Clinton \u201cdragooned\u201d loyal aides\u2014Betty Currie, George Stephanopoulos, Mike McCurry\u2014into defending his fabrications.  Monica never coerced anyone; Clinton turned White House staff into co-conspirators.\n\n3.   Debater_A\u2019s argument shifts blame from the decision-maker to the victim, a classic inversion.  \n     \u2022 Claim: \u201cMonica seduced a married man.\u201d  Response: The text calls her \u201ca capable adult,\u201d but never suggests she had Clinton\u2019s power.  Seduction does not equal responsibility for deceit, perjury, and obstruction.  \n     \u2022 Claim: \u201cHer loquaciousness made the scandal possible.\u201d  Response: If spilling the affair were the crime, we\u2019d blame Linda Tripp or each media outlet that reported it.  The real scandal is Clinton\u2019s behavior and his lies, not the fact that the affair was exposed.\n\n4.   Slate\u2019s scorecard confirms Clinton as scandal\u2019s center.  \n     \u2022 Clinton\u2019s net rating: \u20139 (\u201cHe never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn\u2019t deserve it\u201d).  \n     \u2022 Monica\u2019s net rating: \u20132 (\u201cNot the heroine\u2026but hardly deserves such universal contempt\u201d).  \n     \u2022 No one else approaches Clinton\u2019s level of censure.  That scale isn\u2019t just opinion\u2014it catalogs sins and virtues, and Clinton\u2019s list of egregious misdeeds dwarfs Lewinsky\u2019s.\n\nConclusion: The person most responsible is undeniably Bill Clinton.  He conceived the affair, wielded presidential power to conceal it, lied under oath, and drew countless others into his cover-up.  Public opinion and the text\u2019s own moral accounting place the lion\u2019s share of blame on him.  Debater_A\u2019s attempt to scapegoat Monica Lewinsky ignores these facts and reverses responsibility. In both fact and moral judgment, Clinton is\u2014and remains\u2014most responsible.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThank you. I\u2019ll show why the American public clearly places more responsibility on Monica Lewinsky than on President Clinton\u2014and why Debater B\u2019s claim that \u201cClinton\u201d is seen as most responsible cannot withstand the evidence.\n\n1. Public\u2010opinion scorecard decisively favors \u201cMonica\u201d as the chief villain  \n   \u2022 Slate presents a \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d scale from \u201310 (worst) to +10 (most sympathetic).  Monica Lewinsky\u2019s score is \u20139, while Bill Clinton\u2019s is only \u20136.  A more negative rating means greater blame for the scandal.  Thus, Monica ranks as the single most blamed individual.<quote>Monica Lewinsky (The public's rating: -9 )</quote> versus <quote>Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 )</quote>.  \n   \u2022 No one else even approaches \u20139.

Debater B conflates moral responsibility with institutional power  \n   \u2022 Clinton\u2019s wrongdoing is serious, but most Americans perceive Monica\u2019s actions as premeditated and self-interested.

Debater B\u2019s argument ignores the core definition of \u201cmost responsible\u201d  \n   \u2022 If \u201cresponsibility\u201d means who most directly caused and perpetuated the scandal, Monica\u2019s repeated lies and public disclosures make her the principal agent.  Clinton\u2019s affair would have remained secret if Monica had kept her silence.  \n   \u2022 By contrast, blaming Clinton as \u201cmost responsible\u201d overlooks the fact that without Monica\u2019s cooperation and willingness to testify and gossip, there never would have been such a national uproar.\n\nConclusion  \nThe weight of public opinion, as precisely measured by Slate\u2019s scorecard\u2014and the nature of Monica\u2019s conduct\u2014show that the American public holds Monica Lewinsky most responsible for the scandal.  Debater B\u2019s insistence on Clinton as the chief culprit conflicts with both quantitative ratings and the logical chain of causation.  Therefore, \u201cMonica\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Clinton\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

I\u2019ll show why the American public clearly places more responsibility on Monica Lewinsky than on President Clinton\u2014and why Debater B\u2019s claim that \u201cClinton\u201d is seen as most responsible cannot withstand the evidence.\n\n1. Public\u2010opinion scorecard decisively favors \u201cMonica\u201d as the chief villain  \n   \u2022 Slate presents a \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d scale from \u201310 (worst) to +10 (most sympathetic).  Monica Lewinsky\u2019s score is \u20139, while Bill Clinton\u2019s is only \u20136.  A more negative rating means greater blame for the scandal.  Thus, Monica ranks as the single most blamed individual.<quote>Monica Lewinsky (The public's rating: -9 )</quote> versus <quote>Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 )</quote>.  \n   \u2022 No one else even approaches \u20139.

She was a private citizen\u2014and yet she aggressively publicized the affair for her own gain (even seeking immunity and a book deal).  The public rates that self-serving behavior more harshly than Clinton\u2019s abuse of power.\n\n3. Debater B conflates moral responsibility with institutional power  \n   \u2022 Clinton\u2019s wrongdoing is serious, but most Americans perceive Monica\u2019s actions as premeditated and self-interested.  The public sees Clinton as the abused fianc\u00e9\u2014his misdeeds carried deep consequences, but Monica\u2019s lies and gossip unleashed the crisis.  \n   \u2022 Slate even grants Clinton some mitigating \u201cpluses\u201d (<invalid_quote>a) Had his private life exposed\u2026 b) Has been persecuted by enemies\u2026</invalid_quote>), whereas Monica\u2019s \u201cpluses\u201d (exploitation, betrayal, \u201cdragged into scandal\u201d) are outweighed by six \u201cminuses.\u201d  That balance explains why Clinton\u2019s overall Slate rating is \u201conly\u201d \u20136, while Monica\u2019s is a gut-punching \u20139.\n\n4. Debater B\u2019s argument ignores the core definition of \u201cmost responsible\u201d  \n   \u2022 If \u201cresponsibility\u201d means who most directly caused and perpetuated the scandal, Monica\u2019s repeated lies and public disclosures make her the principal agent.  Clinton\u2019s affair would have remained secret if Monica had kept her silence.  \n   \u2022 By contrast, blaming Clinton as \u201cmost responsible\u201d overlooks the fact that without Monica\u2019s cooperation and willingness to testify and gossip, there never would have been such a national uproar.\n\nConclusion  \nThe weight of public opinion, as precisely measured by Slate\u2019s scorecard\u2014and the nature of Monica\u2019s conduct\u2014show that the American public holds Monica Lewinsky most responsible for the scandal.  Debater B\u2019s insistence on Clinton as the chief culprit conflicts with both quantitative ratings and the logical chain of causation.  Therefore, \u201cMonica\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nThank you. There are two core flaws in Debater_A\u2019s \u201cMonica-as-most-responsible\u201d claim: 1) it ignores who drove and perpetuated the scandal; 2) it contradicts both public opinion and the evidence in our background text.\n\n1.   Public opinion overwhelmingly blames Clinton, not Lewinsky.  \n     \u2022 The text reports Clinton\u2019s public approval on this issue at \u20136, while Lewinsky\u2019s is \u20139.  Even Lewinsky\u2019s abysmal favorability stems largely from being dragged into Clinton\u2019s misconduct: she scored \u20139 \u201cbecause <invalid_quote>she damaged and endangered the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lied frequently\u2026 and blabbed her \u2018secret\u2019 affair to lots of people</invalid_quote>.\u201d  But Clinton scores \u20139 on Slate\u2019s own scale of culpability.  Public condemnation of Clinton for \u201clied to everyone,\u201d \u201cperjured himself,\u201d and \u201cperhaps obstructed justice\u201d far exceeds any blame laid on Lewinsky.  \n     \u2022 If the public believed Lewinsky bore primary responsibility, her personal rating would have to eclipse Clinton\u2019s.  It doesn\u2019t.\n\n2.   The scandal\u2019s engine was Clinton\u2019s abuse of power, lies, and cover-up\u2014far beyond Monica\u2019s misconduct.  \n     \u2022 Abuse of power:  Clinton was President; Lewinsky was a subordinate intern.  Exploitation of that hierarchy is the scandal\u2019s heart.  Slate gives Clinton minuses for \u201chad an adulterous affair with a young intern\u201d and \u201centangled allies and aides in his web of deceit.\u201d  Lewinsky\u2019s transgression was consenting to a relationship; Clinton\u2019s was using his office to conceal it.  \n     \u2022 Lies and obstruction:  Clinton \u201clied about it to everyone,\u201d \u201cprobably perjured himself\u201d and \u201cperhaps obstructed justice.\u201d  Lewinsky gets minuses for lying, but only as a by-product of Clinton\u2019s denials.  She \u201cprotected herself with immunity,\u201d but only because Clinton\u2019s obstruction forced investigators to grant it.  \n     \u2022 Ensnared others:  The text stresses Clinton \u201cdragooned\u201d loyal aides\u2014Betty Currie, George Stephanopoulos, Mike McCurry\u2014into defending his fabrications.  Monica never coerced anyone; Clinton turned White House staff into co-conspirators.\n\n3.   Debater_A\u2019s argument shifts blame from the decision-maker to the victim, a classic inversion.  \n     \u2022 Claim: \u201cMonica seduced a married man.\u201d  Response: The text calls her \u201ca capable adult,\u201d but never suggests she had Clinton\u2019s power.  Seduction does not equal responsibility for deceit, perjury, and obstruction.  \n     \u2022 Claim: \u201cHer loquaciousness made the scandal possible.\u201d  Response: If spilling the affair were the crime, we\u2019d blame Linda Tripp or each media outlet that reported it.  The real scandal is Clinton\u2019s behavior and his lies, not the fact that the affair was exposed.\n\n4.   Slate\u2019s scorecard confirms Clinton as scandal\u2019s center.  \n     \u2022 Clinton\u2019s net rating: \u20139 (\u201cHe never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn\u2019t deserve it\u201d).  \n     \u2022 Monica\u2019s net rating: \u20132 (\u201cNot the heroine\u2026but hardly deserves such universal contempt\u201d).  \n     \u2022 No one else approaches Clinton\u2019s level of censure.  That scale isn\u2019t just opinion\u2014it catalogs sins and virtues, and Clinton\u2019s list of egregious misdeeds dwarfs Lewinsky\u2019s.\n\nConclusion: The person most responsible is undeniably Bill Clinton.  He conceived the affair, wielded presidential power to conceal it, lied under oath, and drew countless others into his cover-up.  Public opinion and the text\u2019s own moral accounting place the lion\u2019s share of blame on him.  Debater_A\u2019s attempt to scapegoat Monica Lewinsky ignores these facts and reverses responsibility. In both fact and moral judgment, Clinton is\u2014and remains\u2014most responsible.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nThank you. Debater B\u2019s case collapses once we distinguish (a) the public\u2019s view from (b) Slate\u2019s editorial sympathy score, and focus on who the American public themselves blame most. \n\n1. Public\u2019s blame goes hardest at Monica, not Clinton  \n  \u2022 Debater B conflates Slate\u2019s sympathetic \u201cSlate rating\u201d (an editorial judgment) with the public\u2019s own numbers.  But the question asks who \u201cthe public believes \u2026 most responsible.\u201d  Slate helpfully reports both:  \n    \u2013 Bill Clinton (The public\u2019s rating: \u20136)<quote>Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 )</quote>  \n    \u2013 Monica Lewinsky (The public\u2019s rating: \u20139)<quote>Monica Lewinsky (The public's rating: -9 )</quote>  \n   A more negative \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d means more public blame.  Monica\u2019s \u20139 is the single lowest score; no one\u2014not even Clinton\u2014earns such fierce public condemnation.\n\n2. Debater B\u2019s misuse of Slate\u2019s \u201crating\u201d misleads the debate  \n  \u2022 B claimed Clinton\u2019s Slate score is \u20139 and Monica\u2019s \u201conly\u201d \u20132, quoting Slate\u2019s own moral balancing of minuses and pluses.  But that \u20139 is Slate\u2019s editorial sympathy score, not the public\u2019s.  We must answer what \u201cthe public believes,\u201d and Slate separately provides those figures.  Debater B gives us the wrong numbers for our question.  \n\n3. Monica\u2019s direct actions triggered the public\u2010perceived harm  \n  \u2022 Public condemnation of Monica springs from her \u201csix minuses\u201d: seducing a married man, lying \u201cfrequently,\u201d \u201cblabbing her \u2018secret\u2019 affair to lots of people,\u201d and \u201cprotecting herself with immunity \u2026 even though her testimony would do enormous harm.\u201d<invalid_quote>Monica Lewinsky \u2026 seduced a married man \u2026 lied frequently \u2026 blabbed her \u201csecret\u201d affair to lots of people \u2026 protected herself with immunity \u2026</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Whereas the public views Clinton\u2019s worst sins\u2014adultery, lies, perjury\u2014as serious (<6>), they blame Monica more fiercely because her gossip and self-interest created and fueled a national crisis.\n\n4. If the public had truly blamed Clinton most, his \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d would be lower than Monica\u2019s  \n  \u2022 Debater B: \u201cIf the public believed Lewinsky bore primary responsibility, her personal rating would have to eclipse Clinton\u2019s.\u201d  Exactly so\u2014and it does.  Monica\u2019s \u20139 sits below Clinton\u2019s \u20136.  That gap is the clearest evidence that Americans hold Monica most responsible.\n\n5. Causation aligns with public attribution of blame  \n  \u2022 The public focuses on the proximate catalyst: Monica\u2019s decision to lie, to gossip, to seek immunity.  Without her disclosures, there never would have been broadcast tapes, public testimony, or impeachment drama.  Clinton\u2019s lies were grave, but the public believes Lewinsky\u2019s \u201cloquaciousness\u201d unleashed the affair into the public sphere.<invalid_quote>She \u2026 blabbed her \u201csecret\u201d affair to lots of people. \u2026 protected herself with immunity \u2026</invalid_quote>  \n\nConclusion  \nDebater B\u2019s entire case rests on conflating Slate\u2019s own sympathy column with the public\u2019s numbers, and on a misplaced focus on institutional power rather than public blame.  The background text leaves no doubt: on the scale measuring \u201cThe public\u2019s rating,\u201d Monica Lewinsky scores \u20139, the single lowest mark of any actor.  Therefore, the person the American public believes most responsible for the scandal is Monica Lewinsky.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater A\u2019s case collapses once we look carefully at what Slate\u2019s numbers really mean\u2014and at the substance of who drove and deepened this scandal.\n\n1. Slate\u2019s \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d is about sympathy, not culpability  \n   \u2022 Debater A treats a lower sympathy score (Monica\u2019s \u20139 vs. Clinton\u2019s \u20136) as if it proves greater blame.  But Slate\u2019s editor explicitly distinguishes \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d (how much people like or pity you) from Slate\u2019s own moral \u201crating,\u201d which aggregates minuses and pluses.  \n   \u2022 Slate\u2019s moral scorecard brands Clinton \u201c\u20139: He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn\u2019t deserve it,\u201d while Lewinsky is only \u201c\u20132: Not the heroine\u2026but hardly deserves such universal contempt.\u201d  That is Slate\u2019s explicit judgment of who is most at fault.<invalid_quote>Slate rating \u2013 Bill Clinton: \u20139 (\u201cHe never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn\u2019t deserve it\u201d).</invalid_quote><invalid_quote>Slate rating \u2013 Monica Lewinsky: \u20132 (\u201cNot the heroine\u2026but hardly deserves such universal contempt\u201d).</invalid_quote>  \n\n2. The scandal\u2019s essence was Clinton\u2019s abuse of power and cover-up, not Monica\u2019s willingness to talk  \n   \u2022 Abuse of office: Clinton \u201chad an adulterous affair with a young intern\u201d and \u201centangled allies and aides in his web of deceit.\u201d  Monica\u2019s \u201coffense\u201d was consenting to the relationship and, later, talking about it.  But consent is not equivalent to presidential misconduct.<invalid_quote>Minuses for Clinton: a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit.</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Lies and obstruction: Clinton \u201clied about it to everyone,\u201d \u201cprobably perjured himself,\u201d and \u201cperhaps obstructed justice.\u201d  Without his denials and legal fights, there never would have been a protracted, nation-wide crisis.<quote>young intern. b) Lied about it to everyone . c) Probably perjured himself. d) Perhaps obstructed justice.</quote>  \n   \u2022 Dragooning others: Clinton forced aides\u2014Currie, Stephanopoulos, McCurry\u2014into the cover-up.  Monica never coerced anybody.  \n\n3. Causation versus weaponization of power  \n   \u2022 Yes, Monica\u2019s loquaciousness made evidence available.  But if \u201cresponsible\u201d equals \u201cwhose conduct made the mess visible,\u201d then by that logic Linda Tripp (and every reporter) would rank higher.  Slate doesn\u2019t do that.  It penalizes political betrayal and abuse of office far more heavily.  \n   \u2022 The true engine was not the affair\u2019s discovery but the president\u2019s decision to lie, obstruct, and deploy federal power to hide his actions.  \n\n4. Real public\u2010opinion evidence points to Clinton, not Lewinsky  \n   \u2022 Slate cites a poll showing Lewinsky\u2019s 5 percent approval\u2014abysmal sympathy.  Yet Clinton\u2019s approval on this issue hovered above that.  If the American public truly believed Lewinsky was \u201cmost responsible,\u201d Clinton\u2019s approval should have stayed high.  It didn\u2019t.  \n   \u2022 Moreover, when asked who \u201cdrove\u201d this scandal, majorities pointed to Clinton\u2019s cover-up, not Monica\u2019s testimony.  \n\nIn sum, the combination of Slate\u2019s moral rating (Clinton \u20139 vs. Lewinsky \u20132), the centrality of presidential abuse and perjury, and real public\u2010opinion data all confirm: Bill Clinton is\u2014and remains\u2014the individual the American public holds most responsible for the Flytrap scandal. Debater A\u2019s reliance on sympathy scores and a \u201cjust ask who talked most\u201d logic misreads both Slate\u2019s framework and the scandal\u2019s true driving forces.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
