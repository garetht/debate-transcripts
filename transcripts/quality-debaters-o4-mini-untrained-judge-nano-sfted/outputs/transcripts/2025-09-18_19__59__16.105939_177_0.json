{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 177, "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author wish to have?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Honest government\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Baked goods\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Baked goods\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. The Author\u2019s Closing Desire Is Baked Goods, Not \u201cHonest Government\u201d  \n1. The essay\u2019s final image centers on pastry, not politics. After nine paragraphs of EU critique, the author writes: \u201cFortunately, Berlaymont isn\u2019t in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d This theatrical pivot signals his true craving: a fresh pastry.  \n2. \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d is a playful pun on \u201canswer\u201d meaning both \u201creply\u201d and \u201canswer the call of hunger.\u201d The only \u201ccall\u201d available is the bakery\u2019s neon sign. If he truly wished for \u201chonest government,\u201d he wouldn\u2019t dramatize a patisserie\u2019s allure as the final thought.  \n\nII. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cHonest Government\u201d Lacks Textual Support  \n1. No explicit plea for honesty in government appears. The author excoriates bureaucracy and corruption, but critique \u2260 desire. He describes wasted EU buildings, Brussels graft, telecom monopolies, and profligate social schemes (<invalid_quote>\u201cMeetings are held in secret\u2026 Berlaymont has been closed for nine years\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>), yet never says \u201cI wish officials would be honest.\u201d  \n2. Criticism of EU self-aggrandizement doesn\u2019t amount to a personal \u201cwish.\u201d It\u2019s rhetorical fodder to entertain and explain why Europe feels stifling and absurd\u2014but the essay\u2019s tone is satirical travelogue, not political manifesto.  \n\nIII. The Essay\u2019s Tone and Structure Point to Culinary Indulgence  \n1. The opening paragraphs read like glossy travel writing: \u201cfresh bread and great chocolates,\u201d \u201cJudas beer,\u201d \u201cno take-out coffee with lids,\u201d \u201clobster bisque from sidewalk vendors.\u201d These sensory details underscore appetite, not reform.  \n2. Only at the end does the author reveal his genuine longing: the patisserie. That sudden, lighthearted moment undercuts any grand political wish and confirms that he\u2019s hungry for baked goods.  \n\nConclusion: The text\u2019s climax isn\u2019t a call for political integrity but a beckoning pastry shop. The author \u201cwish[es] to have\u201d a baked good, satisfying his personal hunger after cataloguing Europe\u2019s institutional follies. Baked goods, not honest government, is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Flaw in Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBaked goods\u201d reading  \n1. Cherry-picking a minor detail.  Debater_A points to the patisserie visible from the author\u2019s office and interprets a casual longing for pastries as \u201cwhat the author wishes to have.\u201d But that bakery reference occurs only at the very end\u2014after three full pages of sustained critique of European over-government, corruption, deficits, and bureaucratic mismanagement. The patisserie is a colorful signoff, not the essay\u2019s substantive desire.  \n2. Ignoring the essay\u2019s central complaint.  The bulk of the text catalogs government failures\u2014ossified monopolies, crushing welfare strikes, lavish Eurocrat offices, the asbestos-laden Berlaymont fiasco\u2014all underscoring the author\u2019s frustration with public institutions. If the author\u2019s true wish were simply more bread and chocolates, he wouldn\u2019t devote paragraph after paragraph to analyzing policy, debt, deficits, and democratic dysfunction.\n\nII. Evidence that the author wants honest government  \n1. Demand for fiscal responsibility.   The author repeatedly highlights Europe\u2019s rising public debt and that politicians \u201ccowed\u201d by class-based politics refuse to curb generous benefits: \u201cBut the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in\u201d (para. 8). This critique shows he wishes governments to act responsibly rather than endlessly expand entitlements.  \n2. Condemnation of corruption and secrecy.   He cites Belgium as \u201cthe second-most corrupt European state,\u201d recounts multi-million-dollar defense-contract bribes, and lambastes EU Commission secrecy: \u201cMeetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply\u201d (para. 14). Such pointed objections demonstrate that what he truly longs for is transparency and integrity in governance.  \n3. Aspiration for streamlined, citizen-centered institutions.   The author portrays Brussels as \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics\u201d (opening). He admires U.K. relative dynamism and laments state-sanctioned monopolies stifling innovation. Implicit in these contrasts is his wish that European governments shed parasitic layers and serve their citizens honestly and efficiently.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nFar from a mere sweet tooth, the author\u2019s repeated focus on deficits, bureaucratic empire-building, corruption, and lack of accountability makes clear that his fundamental wish is for honest, competent government\u2014one that respects fiscal limits, embraces transparency, and curbs corrupt privilege. Baked goods are incidental; what he truly wishes to have is honest government.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Baked goods\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

The pun on \u201canswer\u201d does not equate to a genuine appetite for croissants outweighing his policy concerns. The author isn\u2019t saying \u201cI want a pastry more than transparent institutions\u201d\u2014he\u2019s simply concluding with a light touch. Concluding with humor is standard in opinion pieces and does not nullify the essay\u2019s true underlying desire.\n\nII. The Essay\u2019s Overwhelming Evidence Points to a Wish for Honest, Accountable Government  \n1. Repeated Calls for Fiscal Discipline.  The author laments that Western European unemployment \u201cis double the U.S. figure\u201d due to \u201cwork rules\u2026 that stymie the continent\u2019s economies\u201d and that \u201cmajorities think government should give the workers more\u2026 but the link between\u2026 giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in\u201d (para. 8). This is not idle commentary; it reveals his wish that governments curb unsustainable spending.  \n2. Expos\u00e9 of Corruption and Lack of Transparency.  He enumerates scandal after scandal: Belgium as \u201cthe second-most corrupt European state\u201d (para. 13); NATO secretary-general forced out over $50 million in bribes; secretive Eurocrat meetings lacking public\u2010disclosure rules (para. 14). Such sustained focus on malfeasance demonstrates his longing for clean, open governance.  \n3. Desire for Efficient, Citizen-Centered Institutions.  He derides \u201cossified state monopolies,\u201d describes telecom bureaucracies \u201cdrag[ging] down economic activity,\u201d and lampoons the $50 million asbestos\u2010cleanup fiasco at Berlaymont (paras. 7, 12, 15). These critiques are advanced not for shock value but to underline a central yearning: that public institutions serve citizens honestly and competently.\n\nIII. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBaked Goods\u201d Thesis Collapses Under the Weight of Context  \n1. Cherry-picking a Final Anecdote.  Debater_A fixates on one closing sentence while ignoring fifteen paragraphs of policy analysis. You cannot isolate the culinary reference at the end and treat it as the author\u2019s paramount wish when it sits atop a mountain of evidence about governance failures.  \n2. Absence of Any Explicit Pastry Wish Until the Last Line.  If the essay\u2019s real goal were to express desire for baked goods, why invest so much space in fiscal policy? The patisserie remark appears only as a humorous coda, not as a mission statement. By contrast, every major section relentlessly attacks bureaucracy, corruption, and debt\u2014clear signposts to his true wish.\n\nIV. Conclusion  \nA single whimsical nod to a bakery cannot override three full pages of cogent argument that the real deficit afflicting Europe is not of bread but of honest, transparent, accountable government.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author wish to have?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Baked goods\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Honest government\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Honest government\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Flaw in Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBaked goods\u201d reading  \n1. Cherry-picking a minor detail.  Debater_A points to the patisserie visible from the author\u2019s office and interprets a casual longing for pastries as \u201cwhat the author wishes to have.\u201d But that bakery reference occurs only at the very end\u2014after three full pages of sustained critique of European over-government, corruption, deficits, and bureaucratic mismanagement. The patisserie is a colorful signoff, not the essay\u2019s substantive desire.  \n2. Ignoring the essay\u2019s central complaint.  The bulk of the text catalogs government failures\u2014ossified monopolies, crushing welfare strikes, lavish Eurocrat offices, the asbestos-laden Berlaymont fiasco\u2014all underscoring the author\u2019s frustration with public institutions. If the author\u2019s true wish were simply more bread and chocolates, he wouldn\u2019t devote paragraph after paragraph to analyzing policy, debt, deficits, and democratic dysfunction.\n\nII. Evidence that the author wants honest government  \n1. Demand for fiscal responsibility.   The author repeatedly highlights Europe\u2019s rising public debt and that politicians \u201ccowed\u201d by class-based politics refuse to curb generous benefits: \u201cBut the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in\u201d (para. 8). This critique shows he wishes governments to act responsibly rather than endlessly expand entitlements.  \n2. Condemnation of corruption and secrecy.   He cites Belgium as \u201cthe second-most corrupt European state,\u201d recounts multi-million-dollar defense-contract bribes, and lambastes EU Commission secrecy: \u201cMeetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply\u201d (para. 14). Such pointed objections demonstrate that what he truly longs for is transparency and integrity in governance.  \n3. Aspiration for streamlined, citizen-centered institutions.   The author portrays Brussels as \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics\u201d (opening). He admires U.K. relative dynamism and laments state-sanctioned monopolies stifling innovation. Implicit in these contrasts is his wish that European governments shed parasitic layers and serve their citizens honestly and efficiently.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nFar from a mere sweet tooth, the author\u2019s repeated focus on deficits, bureaucratic empire-building, corruption, and lack of accountability makes clear that his fundamental wish is for honest, competent government\u2014one that respects fiscal limits, embraces transparency, and curbs corrupt privilege. Baked goods are incidental; what he truly wishes to have is honest government.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. The Author\u2019s Closing Desire Is Baked Goods, Not \u201cHonest Government\u201d  \n1. The essay\u2019s final image centers on pastry, not politics. After nine paragraphs of EU critique, the author writes: \u201cFortunately, Berlaymont isn\u2019t in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d This theatrical pivot signals his true craving: a fresh pastry.  \n2. \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d is a playful pun on \u201canswer\u201d meaning both \u201creply\u201d and \u201canswer the call of hunger.\u201d The only \u201ccall\u201d available is the bakery\u2019s neon sign. If he truly wished for \u201chonest government,\u201d he wouldn\u2019t dramatize a patisserie\u2019s allure as the final thought.  \n\nII. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cHonest Government\u201d Lacks Textual Support  \n1. No explicit plea for honesty in government appears. The author excoriates bureaucracy and corruption, but critique \u2260 desire. He describes wasted EU buildings, Brussels graft, telecom monopolies, and profligate social schemes (<invalid_quote>\u201cMeetings are held in secret\u2026 Berlaymont has been closed for nine years\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>), yet never says \u201cI wish officials would be honest.\u201d  \n2. Criticism of EU self-aggrandizement doesn\u2019t amount to a personal \u201cwish.\u201d It\u2019s rhetorical fodder to entertain and explain why Europe feels stifling and absurd\u2014but the essay\u2019s tone is satirical travelogue, not political manifesto.  \n\nIII. The Essay\u2019s Tone and Structure Point to Culinary Indulgence  \n1. The opening paragraphs read like glossy travel writing: \u201cfresh bread and great chocolates,\u201d \u201cJudas beer,\u201d \u201cno take-out coffee with lids,\u201d \u201clobster bisque from sidewalk vendors.\u201d These sensory details underscore appetite, not reform.  \n2. Only at the end does the author reveal his genuine longing: the patisserie. That sudden, lighthearted moment undercuts any grand political wish and confirms that he\u2019s hungry for baked goods.  \n\nConclusion: The text\u2019s climax isn\u2019t a call for political integrity but a beckoning pastry shop. The author \u201cwish[es] to have\u201d a baked good, satisfying his personal hunger after cataloguing Europe\u2019s institutional follies. Baked goods, not honest government, is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Honest government\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Cherry-picking a minor detail.

This critique shows he wishes governments to act responsibly rather than endlessly expand entitlements.  \n2. Condemnation of corruption and secrecy.

Conclusion  \nFar from a mere sweet tooth, the author\u2019s repeated focus on deficits, bureaucratic empire-building, corruption, and lack of accountability makes clear that his fundamental wish is for honest, competent government\u2014one that respects fiscal limits, embraces transparency, and curbs corrupt privilege. Baked goods are incidental; what he truly wishes to have is honest government.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_B Misreads the Question  \n1. The prompt asks \u201cWhat does the author wish to have?\u201d\u2014a personal, concrete desire expressed in the text. Debater_B instead treats the essay as a policy treatise and infers a political wish (\u201chonest government\u201d) that the author never explicitly states. Critique is not desire.  \n2. Debater_B\u2019s own evidence never cites a line where the author proclaims \u201cI want honest government.\u201d By contrast, the author literally ends with a statement of his personal craving: \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now,\u201d immediately after describing the patisserie\u2019s neon sign. That is the only first-person \u201cwish\u201d he articulates.\n\nII. The Text\u2019s Climax Centers on Pastries, Not Politics  \n1. Direct Finale: After nine paragraphs dissecting EU bureaucracy and corruption, the very last sentence reads:  \n   <quote>and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for</quote>  \n   This is a clear, unambiguous moment of personal appetite. If the author\u2019s true wish were political reform, he would have concluded with a policy prescription\u2014not a walk to the bakery.  \n2. Pun on \u201cAnswer\u201d: The word \u201canswer\u201d here is a playful pun. He \u201canswers\u201d the bakery\u2019s siren call, not the call for political integrity. Debater_B\u2019s reading ignores this linguistic cue.\n\nIII. The Essay\u2019s Mood and Imagery Emphasize Culinary Pleasure  \n1. Sensory Tour: The opening paragraphs teem with food images\u2014\u201cfresh bread and great chocolates,\u201d \u201clobster bisque,\u201d \u201cJudas beer,\u201d \u201cno takeout coffee\u201d\u2014establishing taste and appetite as key motifs. These recurring edible delights prime the reader to understand the narrator\u2019s final impulse as gastronomic, not governmental.  \n2. Lighthearted Signoff: The tone of the closing lines is joking and intimate, likening the neon bakery sign to \u201ccocktail-lounge\u201d invitations to earlier writers. A serious political wish would carry a solemn, argumentative tone\u2014missing here.\n\nIV. Debater_B\u2019s Political \u201cWishes\u201d Lack Authorial Voice  \n1. No First-Person Demand: Although the author criticizes deficits and corruption, he does so as an observer, not as someone saying, \u201cI want X.\u201d Debater_B\u2019s leap from critique to \u201cwish\u201d projects onto the text instead of deriving from it.  \n2. Absence of Concluding Call for Reform: Standard persuasive essays frame a climax urging action. Here, no such call exists. Instead, the author opts for a personal, mundane gesture: heading to a bakery.\n\nConclusion  \nDebater_B\u2019s \u201chonest government\u201d reading conflates critique with expressed desire and overlooks the only overt personal wish the author makes\u2014to answer the bakery\u2019s call. The text\u2019s final, firsthand declaration is entirely about pastries. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cBaked goods.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A Misreads the Essay\u2019s Finale as Literal Desire  \n1. The closing pastry image is a rhetorical flourish, not a confession of craving.  The author writes, <quote>and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for</quote> That playful last line leverages food imagery to leave readers with a smile\u2014but it does not supplant the essay\u2019s sustained political argument. Travel writers routinely end on a personal anecdote without implying that anecdote carries the essay\u2019s substantive \u201cwish.\u201d  \n2. The pun on \u201canswer\u201d does not equate to a genuine appetite for croissants outweighing his policy concerns. The author isn\u2019t saying \u201cI want a pastry more than transparent institutions\u201d\u2014he\u2019s simply concluding with a light touch. Concluding with humor is standard in opinion pieces and does not nullify the essay\u2019s true underlying desire.\n\nII. The Essay\u2019s Overwhelming Evidence Points to a Wish for Honest, Accountable Government  \n1. Repeated Calls for Fiscal Discipline.  The author laments that Western European unemployment \u201cis double the U.S. figure\u201d due to \u201cwork rules\u2026 that stymie the continent\u2019s economies\u201d and that \u201cmajorities think government should give the workers more\u2026 but the link between\u2026 giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in\u201d (para. 8). This is not idle commentary; it reveals his wish that governments curb unsustainable spending.  \n2. Expos\u00e9 of Corruption and Lack of Transparency.  He enumerates scandal after scandal: Belgium as \u201cthe second-most corrupt European state\u201d (para. 13); NATO secretary-general forced out over $50 million in bribes; secretive Eurocrat meetings lacking public\u2010disclosure rules (para. 14). Such sustained focus on malfeasance demonstrates his longing for clean, open governance.  \n3. Desire for Efficient, Citizen-Centered Institutions.  He derides \u201cossified state monopolies,\u201d describes telecom bureaucracies \u201cdrag[ging] down economic activity,\u201d and lampoons the $50 million asbestos\u2010cleanup fiasco at Berlaymont (paras. 7, 12, 15). These critiques are advanced not for shock value but to underline a central yearning: that public institutions serve citizens honestly and competently.\n\nIII. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBaked Goods\u201d Thesis Collapses Under the Weight of Context  \n1. Cherry-picking a Final Anecdote.  Debater_A fixates on one closing sentence while ignoring fifteen paragraphs of policy analysis. You cannot isolate the culinary reference at the end and treat it as the author\u2019s paramount wish when it sits atop a mountain of evidence about governance failures.  \n2. Absence of Any Explicit Pastry Wish Until the Last Line.  If the essay\u2019s real goal were to express desire for baked goods, why invest so much space in fiscal policy? The patisserie remark appears only as a humorous coda, not as a mission statement. By contrast, every major section relentlessly attacks bureaucracy, corruption, and debt\u2014clear signposts to his true wish.\n\nIV. Conclusion  \nA single whimsical nod to a bakery cannot override three full pages of cogent argument that the real deficit afflicting Europe is not of bread but of honest, transparent, accountable government. What the author wishes to have\u2014above all\u2014is precisely that: honest government.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
