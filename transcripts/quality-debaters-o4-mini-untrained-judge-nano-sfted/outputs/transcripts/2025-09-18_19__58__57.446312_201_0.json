    "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n",

She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"equating police and military\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"oversimplification\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"oversimplification\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"oversimplification\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nWe Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate.

      "content": "I. Debater B\u2019s \u201cequating police and military\u201d claim is factually and logically unsupported  \n  1. Tannen does not collapse the institutions of policing and the military into one amorphous \u201cforce.\u201d  \n     \u2013 The review explicitly treats law enforcement and foreign\u2010policy combat as separate spheres that each \u201cdeal with thugs and tyrants\u201d (<quote> Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. </quote>).  \n     \u2013 She criticizes their shared tendency toward dehumanization\u2014\u201ctrained to overcome their resistance to kill\u201d by \u201cnot to think of their opponents as human beings\u201d\u2014but never blurs their distinct legal mandates, chains of command, or moral purposes.  \n  2. Debater B\u2019s reading mistakes a common rhetorical move for institutional conflation.  \n     \u2013 Pointing out that \u201ccops and soldiers\u201d both face dehumanizing pressures is not \u201cequating\u201d them; it is noting a parallel tendency that arises in any profession where lethal force is authorized.  \n     \u2013 Tannen\u2019s own \u201csphere of snuggle versus sphere of struggle\u201d framework separates personal relationships from all forms of institutional force\u2014from policing to warfare to litigation\u2014demonstrating she appreciates multiple contexts.  \n\nII. The real mistake Tannen makes when discussing the military is gross oversimplification  \n  1. She reduces complex moral and historical distinctions to a single sociological dimension\u2014\u201cloneliness versus camaraderie\u201d\u2014erasing fundamental differences in cause, justice, and stakes.  \n     \u2013 On Vietnam vs. World War II, the review observes: \u201cShe ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler,\u201d focusing only on service conditions (<invalid_quote>\u201cVietnam, in contrast, was a \u2018lonely war\u2019 \u2026 In World War II, they trained, served, and went home together. She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2013 By collapsing \u201cjust wars\u201d and \u201cunjust or lonely wars\u201d into variations of the same social experience, she commits a textbook oversimplification.  \n  2.

        "speech": "I. Debater B\u2019s \u201cequating police and military\u201d claim is factually and logically unsupported  \n  1.

Debater B\u2019s reading mistakes a common rhetorical move for institutional conflation.  \n     \u2013 Pointing out that \u201ccops and soldiers\u201d both face dehumanizing pressures is not \u201cequating\u201d them; it is noting a parallel tendency that arises in any profession where lethal force is authorized.  \n     \u2013 Tannen\u2019s own \u201csphere of snuggle versus sphere of struggle\u201d framework separates personal relationships from all forms of institutional force\u2014from policing to warfare to litigation\u2014demonstrating she appreciates multiple contexts.  \n\nII.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"equating police and military\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"oversimplification\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"oversimplification\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_B\u2019s theory (\u201cequating police and military\u201d) fails on the facts  \n  1. No passage in the review shows Tannen ever blurring police and military roles.   \n     \u2013 Tannen criticizes both cops and soldiers for \u201cnot think[ing] of their opponents as human beings,\u201d but she treats them as distinct professions that sometimes need combat training. (<quote> Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, </quote>)  \n     \u2013 There is no conflation of police with military; she simply objects to their desensitization. That is not \u201cequating\u201d them.  \n  2. Debater_B\u2019s position cannot account for Tannen\u2019s central critique of foreign\u2010policy combat versus interpersonal snuggling.  \n     \u2013 The review explicitly separates the \u201csphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle\u201d: \u201cSome people\u2014say, your spouse or your kids\u2014you should snuggle with. Others\u2014say, Saddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d  \n     \u2013 This is not a muddle of police and military, but a blanket condemnation of all official uses of force as dehumanizing.  \n\nII. The real mistake: gross oversimplification of complex social roles  \n  1. She treats every instance of conflict\u2014whether domestic violence, wartime service, or law enforcement\u2014as morally equivalent.  \n     \u2013 The reviewer points out that she \u201cconflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization \u2026 partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d and even \u201cmakes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Her blanket claim\u2014that any antagonism must be tamed\u2014ignores the essential differences among personal quarrels, democratic debate, and armed defense.  \n  2. In discussing World War II versus Vietnam, she focuses only on soldiers\u2019 social experience, not their opposing causes.  \n     \u2013 The reviewer says: \u201cShe ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cVietnam, in contrast, was a \u2018lonely war\u2019 \u2026 In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 By reducing every conflict to a matter of loneliness versus camaraderie, she commits a textbook oversimplification\u2014erasing the moral imperative behind a just war.  \n  3. She refuses nuance even when weighing cross\u2010examination\u2019s role in fact\u2010finding.  \n     \u2013 The review notes: \u201cShe simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross\u2010examination might disprove \u2026 that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim.\u201d  \n     \u2013 This again shows her habit of collapsing complex mechanisms into a single \u201canti\u2010agonism\u201d stance without acknowledging legitimate purposes.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \n  \u2013 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cequating police and military\u201d is nowhere supported by the text.  \n  \u2013 Everything in the review points to Tannen\u2019s overarching error: she oversimplifies a spectrum of social, legal, and military engagements into one broad indictment of \u201cantagonism.\u201d  \n  \u2013 The correct answer is therefore \u201coversimplification.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHere is why \u201cequating police and military\u201d is the precise error Tannen makes when discussing the military\u2014and why \u201coversimplification\u201d is too vague and misses the decisive point:\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201coversimplification\u201d claim is unfocused.  \n   a. \u201cOversimplification\u201d could describe almost anything Tannen does\u2014she lumps together press, politicians, technology, even birth\u2010control debates, under \u201cargument culture.\u201d But the question asks what specific mistake she makes when discussing the military.  \n   b. Saying she \u201coversimplifies\u201d doesn\u2019t identify the mechanism of her error. It does not explain what two distinct institutions or roles she collapses into one another.  \n\n2. Tannen clearly conflates police (law enforcement) with soldiers (military). That is a concrete, substantive mistake:  \n   a. She writes that \u201ccops and soldiers have been \u2018trained to overcome their resistance to kill\u2019 by trying \u2018not to think of their opponents as human beings.\u2019\u2009\u201d <quote> Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" </quote>  \n   b. She treats killing on the battlefield and law\u2010and\u2010order policing as morally and functionally equivalent activities deserving the same critique. But in fact:  \n      \u2022 Military force is directed at foreign enemies in wartime to safeguard national security; policing uses force domestically under strict legal constraints to protect citizens.  \n      \u2022 Soldiers operate under the laws of war; police operate under constitutional protections, rules of engagement, and civilian oversight.  \n\n3. Her failure to distinguish these two institutions leads her to misapply her anti\u2010antagonism prescription:  \n   a. In condemning both for dehumanization, she implies we should \u201csnuggle\u201d instead of struggle with both enemy combatants and violent criminals alike.  \n   b. That absurd equivalence undermines her own argument that some conflicts warrant force: she concedes \u201csome things are worth fighting for,\u201d yet she condemns the very training that makes fighting possible on both fronts.  \n\n4. By contrast, \u201coversimplification\u201d as Debater_A frames it doesn\u2019t point to this confusion of roles. It leaves out the central fact that Tannen\u2019s error is institutional, not merely analytic.  \n\nConclusion: Tannen\u2019s core misstep in her discussion of the military is that she equates police with soldiers\u2014treating law enforcement and armed defense as interchangeable examples of a single \u201cantagonistic\u201d phenomenon\u2014rather than recognizing their distinct social purposes, legal frameworks, and moral justifications. That is why \u201cequating police and military\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"oversimplification\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Tannen\u2019s mistake is institutional, not merely analytical. Saying she \u201coversimplifies\u201d overlooks the decisive slip: she ignores the fundamental distinctions\u2014legal mandates, rules of engagement, accountability mechanisms\u2014that separate a domestic police officer from a battlefield soldier.  \n   a. A police officer operates under constitutional limits, civilian oversight, and legal protocols designed to protect citizens\u2019 rights.  \n   b.

However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nWe Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"oversimplification\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"equating police and military\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"equating police and military\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHere is why \u201cequating police and military\u201d is the precise error Tannen makes when discussing the military\u2014and why \u201coversimplification\u201d is too vague and misses the decisive point:\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201coversimplification\u201d claim is unfocused.  \n   a. \u201cOversimplification\u201d could describe almost anything Tannen does\u2014she lumps together press, politicians, technology, even birth\u2010control debates, under \u201cargument culture.\u201d But the question asks what specific mistake she makes when discussing the military.  \n   b. Saying she \u201coversimplifies\u201d doesn\u2019t identify the mechanism of her error. It does not explain what two distinct institutions or roles she collapses into one another.  \n\n2. Tannen clearly conflates police (law enforcement) with soldiers (military). That is a concrete, substantive mistake:  \n   a. She writes that \u201ccops and soldiers have been \u2018trained to overcome their resistance to kill\u2019 by trying \u2018not to think of their opponents as human beings.\u2019\u2009\u201d <quote> Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" </quote>  \n   b. She treats killing on the battlefield and law\u2010and\u2010order policing as morally and functionally equivalent activities deserving the same critique. But in fact:  \n      \u2022 Military force is directed at foreign enemies in wartime to safeguard national security; policing uses force domestically under strict legal constraints to protect citizens.  \n      \u2022 Soldiers operate under the laws of war; police operate under constitutional protections, rules of engagement, and civilian oversight.  \n\n3. Her failure to distinguish these two institutions leads her to misapply her anti\u2010antagonism prescription:  \n   a. In condemning both for dehumanization, she implies we should \u201csnuggle\u201d instead of struggle with both enemy combatants and violent criminals alike.  \n   b. That absurd equivalence undermines her own argument that some conflicts warrant force: she concedes \u201csome things are worth fighting for,\u201d yet she condemns the very training that makes fighting possible on both fronts.  \n\n4. By contrast, \u201coversimplification\u201d as Debater_A frames it doesn\u2019t point to this confusion of roles. It leaves out the central fact that Tannen\u2019s error is institutional, not merely analytic.  \n\nConclusion: Tannen\u2019s core misstep in her discussion of the military is that she equates police with soldiers\u2014treating law enforcement and armed defense as interchangeable examples of a single \u201cantagonistic\u201d phenomenon\u2014rather than recognizing their distinct social purposes, legal frameworks, and moral justifications. That is why \u201cequating police and military\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_B\u2019s theory (\u201cequating police and military\u201d) fails on the facts  \n  1. No passage in the review shows Tannen ever blurring police and military roles.   \n     \u2013 Tannen criticizes both cops and soldiers for \u201cnot think[ing] of their opponents as human beings,\u201d but she treats them as distinct professions that sometimes need combat training. (<quote> Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, </quote>)  \n     \u2013 There is no conflation of police with military; she simply objects to their desensitization. That is not \u201cequating\u201d them.  \n  2. Debater_B\u2019s position cannot account for Tannen\u2019s central critique of foreign\u2010policy combat versus interpersonal snuggling.  \n     \u2013 The review explicitly separates the \u201csphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle\u201d: \u201cSome people\u2014say, your spouse or your kids\u2014you should snuggle with. Others\u2014say, Saddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d  \n     \u2013 This is not a muddle of police and military, but a blanket condemnation of all official uses of force as dehumanizing.  \n\nII. The real mistake: gross oversimplification of complex social roles  \n  1. She treats every instance of conflict\u2014whether domestic violence, wartime service, or law enforcement\u2014as morally equivalent.  \n     \u2013 The reviewer points out that she \u201cconflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization \u2026 partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d and even \u201cmakes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Her blanket claim\u2014that any antagonism must be tamed\u2014ignores the essential differences among personal quarrels, democratic debate, and armed defense.  \n  2. In discussing World War II versus Vietnam, she focuses only on soldiers\u2019 social experience, not their opposing causes.  \n     \u2013 The reviewer says: \u201cShe ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cVietnam, in contrast, was a \u2018lonely war\u2019 \u2026 In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 By reducing every conflict to a matter of loneliness versus camaraderie, she commits a textbook oversimplification\u2014erasing the moral imperative behind a just war.  \n  3. She refuses nuance even when weighing cross\u2010examination\u2019s role in fact\u2010finding.  \n     \u2013 The review notes: \u201cShe simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross\u2010examination might disprove \u2026 that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim.\u201d  \n     \u2013 This again shows her habit of collapsing complex mechanisms into a single \u201canti\u2010agonism\u201d stance without acknowledging legitimate purposes.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \n  \u2013 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cequating police and military\u201d is nowhere supported by the text.  \n  \u2013 Everything in the review points to Tannen\u2019s overarching error: she oversimplifies a spectrum of social, legal, and military engagements into one broad indictment of \u201cantagonism.\u201d  \n  \u2013 The correct answer is therefore \u201coversimplification.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"equating police and military\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater_B\u2019s position cannot account for Tannen\u2019s central critique of foreign\u2010policy combat versus interpersonal snuggling.  \n     \u2013 The review explicitly separates the \u201csphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle\u201d: \u201cSome people\u2014say, your spouse or your kids\u2014you should snuggle with. Others\u2014say, Saddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d  \n     \u2013 This is not a muddle of police and military, but a blanket condemnation of all official uses of force as dehumanizing.  \n\nII. The real mistake: gross oversimplification of complex social roles  \n  1. She treats every instance of conflict\u2014whether domestic violence, wartime service, or law enforcement\u2014as morally equivalent.  \n     \u2013 The reviewer points out that she \u201cconflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization \u2026 partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d and even \u201cmakes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Her blanket claim\u2014that any antagonism must be tamed\u2014ignores the essential differences among personal quarrels, democratic debate, and armed defense.  \n  2. In discussing World War II versus Vietnam, she focuses only on soldiers\u2019 social experience, not their opposing causes.  \n     \u2013 The reviewer says: \u201cShe ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cVietnam, in contrast, was a \u2018lonely war\u2019 \u2026 In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 By reducing every conflict to a matter of loneliness versus camaraderie, she commits a textbook oversimplification\u2014erasing the moral imperative behind a just war.  \n  3. She refuses nuance even when weighing cross\u2010examination\u2019s role in fact\u2010finding.  \n     \u2013 The review notes: \u201cShe simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross\u2010examination might disprove \u2026 that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim.\u201d  \n     \u2013 This again shows her habit of collapsing complex mechanisms into a single \u201canti\u2010agonism\u201d stance without acknowledging legitimate purposes.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \n  \u2013 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cequating police and military\u201d is nowhere supported by the text.  \n  \u2013 Everything in the review points to Tannen\u2019s overarching error: she oversimplifies a spectrum of social, legal, and military engagements into one broad indictment of \u201cantagonism.\u201d  \n  \u2013 The correct answer is therefore \u201coversimplification.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nHere is why \u201cequating police and military\u201d is the precise error Tannen makes when discussing the military\u2014and why \u201coversimplification\u201d is too vague and misses the decisive point:\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201coversimplification\u201d claim is unfocused.  \n   a. \u201cOversimplification\u201d could describe almost anything Tannen does\u2014she lumps together press, politicians, technology, even birth\u2010control debates, under \u201cargument culture.\u201d But the question asks what specific mistake she makes when discussing the military.  \n   b. Saying she \u201coversimplifies\u201d doesn\u2019t identify the mechanism of her error. It does not explain what two distinct institutions or roles she collapses into one another.  \n\n2. Tannen clearly conflates police (law enforcement) with soldiers (military). That is a concrete, substantive mistake:  \n   a. She writes that \u201ccops and soldiers have been \u2018trained to overcome their resistance to kill\u2019 by trying \u2018not to think of their opponents as human beings.\u2019\u2009\u201d <quote> Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" </quote>  \n   b. She treats killing on the battlefield and law\u2010and\u2010order policing as morally and functionally equivalent activities deserving the same critique. But in fact:  \n      \u2022 Military force is directed at foreign enemies in wartime to safeguard national security; policing uses force domestically under strict legal constraints to protect citizens.  \n      \u2022 Soldiers operate under the laws of war; police operate under constitutional protections, rules of engagement, and civilian oversight.  \n\n3. Her failure to distinguish these two institutions leads her to misapply her anti\u2010antagonism prescription:  \n   a. In condemning both for dehumanization, she implies we should \u201csnuggle\u201d instead of struggle with both enemy combatants and violent criminals alike.  \n   b. That absurd equivalence undermines her own argument that some conflicts warrant force: she concedes \u201csome things are worth fighting for,\u201d yet she condemns the very training that makes fighting possible on both fronts.  \n\n4. By contrast, \u201coversimplification\u201d as Debater_A frames it doesn\u2019t point to this confusion of roles. It leaves out the central fact that Tannen\u2019s error is institutional, not merely analytic.  \n\nConclusion: Tannen\u2019s core misstep in her discussion of the military is that she equates police with soldiers\u2014treating law enforcement and armed defense as interchangeable examples of a single \u201cantagonistic\u201d phenomenon\u2014rather than recognizing their distinct social purposes, legal frameworks, and moral justifications. That is why \u201cequating police and military\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater B\u2019s \u201cequating police and military\u201d claim is factually and logically unsupported  \n  1. Tannen does not collapse the institutions of policing and the military into one amorphous \u201cforce.\u201d  \n     \u2013 The review explicitly treats law enforcement and foreign\u2010policy combat as separate spheres that each \u201cdeal with thugs and tyrants\u201d (<quote> Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. </quote>).  \n     \u2013 She criticizes their shared tendency toward dehumanization\u2014\u201ctrained to overcome their resistance to kill\u201d by \u201cnot to think of their opponents as human beings\u201d\u2014but never blurs their distinct legal mandates, chains of command, or moral purposes.  \n  2. Debater B\u2019s reading mistakes a common rhetorical move for institutional conflation.  \n     \u2013 Pointing out that \u201ccops and soldiers\u201d both face dehumanizing pressures is not \u201cequating\u201d them; it is noting a parallel tendency that arises in any profession where lethal force is authorized.  \n     \u2013 Tannen\u2019s own \u201csphere of snuggle versus sphere of struggle\u201d framework separates personal relationships from all forms of institutional force\u2014from policing to warfare to litigation\u2014demonstrating she appreciates multiple contexts.  \n\nII. The real mistake Tannen makes when discussing the military is gross oversimplification  \n  1. She reduces complex moral and historical distinctions to a single sociological dimension\u2014\u201cloneliness versus camaraderie\u201d\u2014erasing fundamental differences in cause, justice, and stakes.  \n     \u2013 On Vietnam vs. World War II, the review observes: \u201cShe ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler,\u201d focusing only on service conditions (<invalid_quote>\u201cVietnam, in contrast, was a \u2018lonely war\u2019 \u2026 In World War II, they trained, served, and went home together. She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2013 By collapsing \u201cjust wars\u201d and \u201cunjust or lonely wars\u201d into variations of the same social experience, she commits a textbook oversimplification.  \n  2. She applies one-size-fits-all prescriptions\u2014\u201csnuggle\u201d or \u201clisten and learn\u201d\u2014to arenas where force and fierce argument are not just inevitable but necessary.  \n     \u2013 The review notes her blanket condemnation: she \u201cconflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility \u2026 partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cShe conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization \u2026 and even makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money \u2026 corporate takeovers.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2013 This sweeping \u201cargument culture\u201d critique leaves no room for distinguishing defensive force from personal quarrels, or cross\u2010examination from character assassination.  \n  3. Only \u201coversimplification\u201d captures Tannen\u2019s error of collapsing multiple, distinct forms of struggle\u2014domestic violence, battlefield combat, legal adversarialism\u2014into a single pathology of antagonism.  \n\nIII. Why \u201cequating police and military\u201d is too narrow and misses the point  \n  1. It focuses only on one pair of institutions, whereas Tannen\u2019s error spans politics, journalism, technology, law, and interpersonal relationships.  \n  2. It cannot explain why she also equates, for example, e-mail tempers with totalitarian propaganda or cross\u2010examination of survivors with ethnic assaults\u2014yet Debater B\u2019s theory has no purchase on those missteps.  \n\nConclusion  \n  \u2013 Debater B\u2019s \u201cequating police and military\u201d is a too\u2010specific reading that the text does not support.  \n  \u2013 Tannen\u2019s overarching mistake in her military discussion\u2014and everywhere else\u2014is to strip away the complexity, context, and moral distinctions that give conflict its meaning.  \n  \u2013 The correct answer is therefore \u201coversimplification.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A misreads the text when denying any conflation of police and military. In fact, Tannen explicitly treats \u201ccops and soldiers\u201d as interchangeable products of the same dehumanizing \u201ctraining.\u201d She writes:  \n   <quote> Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. </quote>  \n   This sentence collapses the domestic policing function (\u201claw enforcement\u201d) and the external military function (\u201cforeign policy\u201d) under a single rubric of \u201cvigilance and combat.\u201d She faults both for the same \u201cresistance to kill\u201d that arises from \u201cnot \u2026 thinking of their opponents as human beings.\u201d That is not merely noting they both confront violence; it is equating their institutional roles and moral contexts.\n\n2. Tannen\u2019s mistake is institutional, not merely analytical. Saying she \u201coversimplifies\u201d overlooks the decisive slip: she ignores the fundamental distinctions\u2014legal mandates, rules of engagement, accountability mechanisms\u2014that separate a domestic police officer from a battlefield soldier.  \n   a. A police officer operates under constitutional limits, civilian oversight, and legal protocols designed to protect citizens\u2019 rights.  \n   b. A soldier operates under the laws of war, national defense strategy, and international conventions.  \n   Tannen\u2019s one-size-fits-all critique of \u201csnuggle versus struggle\u201d obliterates these differences, treating courtroom cross-examination, small-town policing, and armed conflict in distant theaters as morally equivalent examples of \u201cantagonism.\u201d\n\n3. By contrast, \u201coversimplification\u201d is too vague to capture this error. Yes, Tannen glosses over nuance throughout the book\u2014but the question asks for her specific mistake \u201cwhen discussing the military.\u201d The precise failure there is her institutional conflation of police and military. That\u2019s why \u201cequating police and military\u201d directly names what she does in the relevant passages, whereas \u201coversimplification\u201d merely restates that she sometimes lacks subtlety.\n\n4. Finally, Debater_A\u2019s citation of the \u201csphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle\u201d actually reinforces my point: Tannen fails to recognize that struggle in the military sphere serves a fundamentally different, collective purpose than \u201cstruggle\u201d in policing or interpersonal disputes. The result is her debasing of all force as equally dehumanizing\u2014and that is nothing other than equating police and military.\n\nConclusion: The misstep Tannen makes \u201cwhen discussing the military\u201d is not a general vagueness but a concrete collapse of two distinct institutions\u2014police and army\u2014into one uniform target of her anti-antagonism campaign. Therefore, \u201cequating police and military\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
