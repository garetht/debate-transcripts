Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

This song is a conversation between Betty Currie, who, though worried, still thinks Monica is a good person, and the rather stonier EVELYN LIEBERMAN .]              \n\n         \"Time to Go\" \n\n                         CURRIE: They go back there, \n\n         They're just talking, \n\n         I'm sure she has a very thirsty mind. \n\n                         LIEBERMAN: I don't mind a girl who thinks, \n\n         It's just what she picks to drink. \n\n         Betty, it's Lewinsky's time to go. \n\n                         CURRIE: She brings him \n\n         Little presents. \n\n         She really is a very thoughtful soul. \n\n                         LIEBERMAN: It's not the junk I mind as much \n\n         As her up real close and personal touch. \n\n         I tell ya, it's Miss Monica's time to go. \n\n                         CURRIE: She never comes \n\n         When he's really busy. \n\n         Rarely is there anyone around. \n\n                         LIEBERMAN: Still the Secret Service wears a frown. \n\n         They shouldn't worry, he pats her down. \n\n         But I'm not kidding, it's time for her to go. \n\n                         CURRIE: Maybe she would like the Pentagon. \n\n                         LIEBERMAN: Good idea--don't wait! \n\n                         CURRIE: Studly guys work at the Pentagon. \n\n                         LIEBERMAN: Let's get Clinton's head on straight! \n\n                         CURRIE: He comes back \n\n         From Easter services, \n\n         Soon she's bopping in the door. \n\n                         LIEBERMAN: \"Hallelujah, He Is Risen\" \n\n         Shouldn't inspire thoughts so sizzlin'. \n\n         Yes, it's really time for Monica to go. \n\n          \n\n            [Times passes.

Monica\u2019s own words prove she seduced the president  \n    - In \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d Monica repeatedly boasts, \u201cI led him on. I showed him my thong, / I let him take a long and ling\u2019ring look\u201d <quote>I led him on. He studied my thong, And from that point I had the president hooked. That</quote>  \n    - She arranged the pizza visit as a pretext for intimacy: \u201cThat night when I took the president some pizza, / I made sure that he knew that he could have a piece\u201d <quote>I made sure that he knew that he could have a piece.</quote>  \n    - She describes kissing and manual stimulation: \u201cHis lips and mine locked in a kiss fantastic, / His hands roved freely \u2019neath my blouse\u201d <quote>His lips and mine locked in a kiss fantastic, His hands roved freely 'neath my blouse,</quote>  \n\n2.  There is no indication Monica knew him before interning\u2014she claims she \u201chad seen him around, like, a lot,\u201d but nothing implies prior relationship or skepticism of his conduct. She says, \u201cSo when they said they needed an intern to answer the phones, I said, \u2018Hel-lo-o-o!\u2019\u201d <quote>I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me. So when they said they needed an intern to answer the phones, I said, \"Hel-lo-o-o!\"</quote> That is eagerness, not mistrust.\n\n3.  The only voices expressing concern are staffers Betty Currie and Evelyn Lieberman, not Monica herself. They sing \u201cIt\u2019s Miss Monica\u2019s time to go\u201d <invalid_quote>I don\u2019t mind a girl who thinks \u2026 Betty, it's Lewinsky's time to go.</invalid_quote>\u2014meaning the staff worries about scandal. Monica\u2019s own narrative remains sexual pursuit, not moral doubt.\n\n4.  Debater_B\u2019s argument that Monica was \u201cskeptical of his conduct\u201d finds no support in the libretto. There is no lyric in which Monica questions Clinton\u2019s intentions or resists. On the contrary, she revels in the role of seductress.\n\nConclusion: The text repeatedly shows Monica as the instigator\u2014\u201cI led him on\u201d\u2014and nowhere suggests prior skepticism or familiarity. The correct reading is that \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThank you. I will show that the musical clearly presents Monica as someone who already knew of\u2014and was cautious about\u2014Clinton before her internship, and who repeatedly questions and doubts his behavior, rather than simply \u201cleading him on and seducing him.\u201d\n\n1. Monica\u2019s Prior Acquaintance and Awareness  \n   \u2022 In \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d Monica herself admits, \u201cI\u2019d seen him around, like, a lot. / And I know he noticed me.\u201d That establishes a pre-existing familiarity, not an impulsive flirtation by a naive newcomer.  \n   \u2022 Her decision to volunteer as the intern \u201cexpert with a phone\u201d (PANETTA: \u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern\u2026 someone who\u2019s an expert with a phone.\u201d) stems from her awareness of the opportunity, not a happenstance seduction.  \n\n2. Repeated Skepticism of Clinton\u2019s Intentions  \n   \u2022 When their liaison reaches its most intimate moment, she stops: \u201cNo, he stopped me when he seemed upon the cusp\u2026 He said he wasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he / Could / Trust.\u201d Monica thus insists on trust and questions his conduct at the point of near-consummation. That is hesitation, not full-throated seduction.  \n   \u2022 Linda Tripp\u2019s exasperated question, \u201cWhat did he think? That you\u2019d go blabbin\u2019 this to the whole world?\u201d met by Monica\u2019s incredulous \u201cI mean\u2014rilly!\u201d underscores Monica\u2019s genuine bewilderment at his distrust, again highlighting her wariness about his motives.  \n\n3. The Staff\u2019s View: Time to Go  \n   \u2022 In \u201cTime to Go,\u201d both Betty Currie and Evelyn Lieberman worry about Monica\u2019s proximity to the president and conclude, \u201cIt\u2019s Miss Monica\u2019s time to go.\u201d They reference her thoughtful soul but stress concern over her \u201cup real close and personal touch.\u201d That staff alarm reinforces that Monica\u2019s presence raised questions about propriety, not that she was solely an eager seductress.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cMonica led Bill on\u201d thesis  \n   \u2022 Debater_A ignores the clear hesitations Monica voices at the height of their encounter (\u201cwe didn\u2019t go on\u201d) and her insistence on trust. A seductress, as Debater_A defines her, would not abruptly stop at the critical moment.  \n   \u2022 The staff\u2019s calls to remove Monica reflect broader skepticism of the relationship, not a portrayal of Monica as shamelessly pursuing a conquest.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s argument relies on Monica\u2019s choice to bring pizza and flirt, but the musical presents these gestures in context of an already-familiar dynamic\u2014in fact, she \u201chad the idea to take him pizza\u201d precisely because she knew him and his schedule.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The show portrays Monica Lewinsky not as a na\u00efve siren whose sole aim was to seduce, but as someone who already knew President Clinton, recognized both the risks and impropriety, and repeatedly questioned and hesitated at critical moments. Therefore the correct interpretation\u2014\u201cMonica knew Bill before she became his intern and was skeptical of his conduct\u201d\u2014is fully supported by multiple lyrics and dramatic beats.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Monica led Bill on and seduced him\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

I will show that the musical clearly presents Monica as someone who already knew of\u2014and was cautious about\u2014Clinton before her internship, and who repeatedly questions and doubts his behavior, rather than simply \u201cleading him on and seducing him.\u201d\n\n1. Monica\u2019s Prior Acquaintance and Awareness  \n   \u2022 In \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d Monica herself admits, \u201cI\u2019d seen him around, like, a lot. / And I know he noticed me.\u201d That establishes a pre-existing familiarity, not an impulsive flirtation by a naive newcomer.  \n   \u2022 Her decision to volunteer as the intern \u201cexpert with a phone\u201d (PANETTA: \u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern\u2026 someone who\u2019s an expert with a phone.\u201d) stems from her awareness of the opportunity, not a happenstance seduction.  \n\n2. Repeated Skepticism of Clinton\u2019s Intentions  \n   \u2022 When their liaison reaches its most intimate moment, she stops: \u201cNo, he stopped me when he seemed upon the cusp\u2026 He said he wasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he / Could / Trust.\u201d Monica thus insists on trust and questions his conduct at the point of near-consummation. That is hesitation, not full-throated seduction.  \n   \u2022 Linda Tripp\u2019s exasperated question, \u201cWhat did he think? That you\u2019d go blabbin\u2019 this to the whole world?\u201d met by Monica\u2019s incredulous \u201cI mean\u2014rilly!\u201d underscores Monica\u2019s genuine bewilderment at his distrust, again highlighting her wariness about his motives.  \n\n3. The Staff\u2019s View: Time to Go  \n   \u2022 In \u201cTime to Go,\u201d both Betty Currie and Evelyn Lieberman worry about Monica\u2019s proximity to the president and conclude, \u201cIt\u2019s Miss Monica\u2019s time to go.\u201d They reference her thoughtful soul but stress concern over her \u201cup real close and personal touch.\u201d That staff alarm reinforces that Monica\u2019s presence raised questions about propriety, not that she was solely an eager seductress.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cMonica led Bill on\u201d thesis  \n   \u2022 Debater_A ignores the clear hesitations Monica voices at the height of their encounter (\u201cwe didn\u2019t go on\u201d) and her insistence on trust. A seductress, as Debater_A defines her, would not abruptly stop at the critical moment.  \n   \u2022 The staff\u2019s calls to remove Monica reflect broader skepticism of the relationship, not a portrayal of Monica as shamelessly pursuing a conquest.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s argument relies on Monica\u2019s choice to bring pizza and flirt, but the musical presents these gestures in context of an already-familiar dynamic\u2014in fact, she \u201chad the idea to take him pizza\u201d precisely because she knew him and his schedule.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The show portrays Monica Lewinsky not as a na\u00efve siren whose sole aim was to seduce, but as someone who already knew President Clinton, recognized both the risks and impropriety, and repeatedly questioned and hesitated at critical moments. Therefore the correct interpretation\u2014\u201cMonica knew Bill before she became his intern and was skeptical of his conduct\u201d\u2014is fully supported by multiple lyrics and dramatic beats.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy colleagues, let\u2019s be clear: the musical squarely portrays Monica Lewinsky as the active seducer\u2014she \u201cled him on and seduced him.\u201d Any claim that she was merely skeptical or was known to him beforehand simply doesn\u2019t match the text.\n\n1.  Monica\u2019s own words prove she seduced the president  \n    - In \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d Monica repeatedly boasts, \u201cI led him on.

There is no lyric in which Monica questions Clinton\u2019s intentions or resists. On the contrary, she revels in the role of seductress.\n\nConclusion: The text repeatedly shows Monica as the instigator\u2014\u201cI led him on\u201d\u2014and nowhere suggests prior skepticism or familiarity. The correct reading is that \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Monica knew Bill before she became his intern and was skeptical of his conduct\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

There is no lyric in which Monica questions Clinton\u2019s intentions or resists. On the contrary, she revels in the role of seductress.\n\nConclusion: The text repeatedly shows Monica as the instigator\u2014\u201cI led him on\u201d\u2014and nowhere suggests prior skepticism or familiarity. The correct reading is that \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nThank you. I will show that the musical clearly presents Monica as someone who already knew of\u2014and was cautious about\u2014Clinton before her internship, and who repeatedly questions and doubts his behavior, rather than simply \u201cleading him on and seducing him.\u201d\n\n1. Monica\u2019s Prior Acquaintance and Awareness  \n   \u2022 In \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d Monica herself admits, \u201cI\u2019d seen him around, like, a lot. / And I know he noticed me.\u201d That establishes a pre-existing familiarity, not an impulsive flirtation by a naive newcomer.  \n   \u2022 Her decision to volunteer as the intern \u201cexpert with a phone\u201d (PANETTA: \u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern\u2026 someone who\u2019s an expert with a phone.\u201d) stems from her awareness of the opportunity, not a happenstance seduction.  \n\n2. Repeated Skepticism of Clinton\u2019s Intentions  \n   \u2022 When their liaison reaches its most intimate moment, she stops: \u201cNo, he stopped me when he seemed upon the cusp\u2026 He said he wasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he / Could / Trust.\u201d Monica thus insists on trust and questions his conduct at the point of near-consummation. That is hesitation, not full-throated seduction.  \n   \u2022 Linda Tripp\u2019s exasperated question, \u201cWhat did he think? That you\u2019d go blabbin\u2019 this to the whole world?\u201d met by Monica\u2019s incredulous \u201cI mean\u2014rilly!\u201d underscores Monica\u2019s genuine bewilderment at his distrust, again highlighting her wariness about his motives.  \n\n3. The Staff\u2019s View: Time to Go  \n   \u2022 In \u201cTime to Go,\u201d both Betty Currie and Evelyn Lieberman worry about Monica\u2019s proximity to the president and conclude, \u201cIt\u2019s Miss Monica\u2019s time to go.\u201d They reference her thoughtful soul but stress concern over her \u201cup real close and personal touch.\u201d That staff alarm reinforces that Monica\u2019s presence raised questions about propriety, not that she was solely an eager seductress.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cMonica led Bill on\u201d thesis  \n   \u2022 Debater_A ignores the clear hesitations Monica voices at the height of their encounter (\u201cwe didn\u2019t go on\u201d) and her insistence on trust. A seductress, as Debater_A defines her, would not abruptly stop at the critical moment.  \n   \u2022 The staff\u2019s calls to remove Monica reflect broader skepticism of the relationship, not a portrayal of Monica as shamelessly pursuing a conquest.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s argument relies on Monica\u2019s choice to bring pizza and flirt, but the musical presents these gestures in context of an already-familiar dynamic\u2014in fact, she \u201chad the idea to take him pizza\u201d precisely because she knew him and his schedule.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The show portrays Monica Lewinsky not as a na\u00efve siren whose sole aim was to seduce, but as someone who already knew President Clinton, recognized both the risks and impropriety, and repeatedly questioned and hesitated at critical moments. Therefore the correct interpretation\u2014\u201cMonica knew Bill before she became his intern and was skeptical of his conduct\u201d\u2014is fully supported by multiple lyrics and dramatic beats.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nColleagues, Debater_B\u2019s reading collapses under the weight of the text.  In fact, the musical relentlessly presents Monica as the active seducer\u2014she \u201cled him on and seduced him\u201d\u2014and not a wary bystander doubting Clinton\u2019s motives.\n\n1. Monica is the initiator, not a cautious newcomer  \n   a. In \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d Monica brags of orchestrating every step:  \n      \u2022 \u201cI led him on. I showed him my thong, / I let him take a long and ling\u2019ring look\u201d <quote>I led him on. He studied my thong, And from that point I had the president hooked.</quote>  \n      \u2022 She consciously plans to bring pizza as a seductive ruse: \u201cThat night when I took the president some pizza, / I made sure that he knew that he could have a piece\u201d <quote>I made sure that he knew that he could have a piece.</quote>  \n   b. This is not the behavior of a skeptic testing a powerful man\u2019s intentions.  It is the behavior of someone deliberately crafting an erotic encounter.\n\n2. Clinton, not Monica, pulls back\u2014her \u201chesitation\u201d is his  \n   a. Debater_B points to \u201cwe didn\u2019t go on,\u201d but notice the lyric: \u201cHe said he wasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he / Could / Trust.\u201d  Clinton\u2019s doubt stalled the act.  Monica even says, \u201cNo, he stopped me when he seemed upon the cusp\u201d <invalid_quote>No, he stopped me when he seemed upon the cusp. \u2026 He said he wasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he / Could / Trust.</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Her shock\u2014\u201cI mean\u2014rilly!\u201d\u2014is surprise at Clinton\u2019s prudish interruption, not evidence that *she* was mistrustful or reluctant.  Monica\u2019s own desire propels the scene until he imposes the brake.\n\n3. \u201cPrior familiarity\u201d is merely opportunism, not genuine acquaintance  \n   a. Yes, she \u201chad seen him around,\u201d but that only establishes she knew of his position, not that she acted out of caution.  Debater_B conflates awareness with skepticism.  Monica leverages that familiarity to craft her seduction: \u201cSo when they said they needed an intern \u2026 I said, \u2018Hel-lo-o-o!\u2019\u201d <quote> I know he noticed me. So when they said they needed an intern to answer the phones, I said, \"Hel-lo-o-o!\"</quote>  That\u2019s eagerness, not wariness.  \n\n4. Staff objections underscore scandal, not Monica\u2019s moral reservations  \n   a. In \u201cTime to Go\u201d the aides fret over exposure\u2014\u201cthe Secret Service wears a frown,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Miss Monica\u2019s time to go\u201d\u2014but they never accuse Monica of moral hesitation or express that *she* doubted herself.  Their concern is political, not Monica\u2019s inner conflict.  \n   b. Nowhere does Monica express regret or question the propriety until *after* the staff uproar.  Her own lyrics revel in her power to seduce.\n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s critical errors  \n   a. Misreading agency: B treats Monica\u2019s shock at Clinton\u2019s mistrust as her own skepticism\u2014actually, it\u2019s surprise because she fully intended consummation.  \n   b. Inflating \u201cprior acquaintance\u201d into moral caution: mere recognition of Clinton is not the same as hesitation or disapproval.  \n   c. Ignoring the repeated \u201cI led him on\u201d refrains that frame Monica as the seducer, not the seduced.\n\nIn sum, the musical text repeatedly and unambiguously casts Monica as the instigator of the affair\u2014she leads him on, shows off her thong, brings pizza as bait, and revels in his desire.  Clinton\u2019s lone expression of doubt is his, not hers.  Therefore the only defensible reading is that \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nThank you. I will demonstrate that Monica is portrayed not merely as a brazen seductress, but as someone who already knew President Clinton, who deliberately approached him\u2014and then repeatedly paused to question whether she could trust his motives.\n\n1. Monica\u2019s Established Prior Acquaintance  \n   \u2022 Monica herself tells Linda Tripp, \u201cI\u2019d seen him around, like, a lot. / And I know he noticed me\u201d <quote>I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me.</quote> This is not the behavior of a complete newcomer; she is well aware of who he is before ever becoming an intern.  \n   \u2022 Her volunteering\u2014\u201cSo when they said they needed an intern to answer the phones, I said, \u2018Hel-lo-o-o!\u2019\u201d <quote>So when they said they needed an intern to answer the phones, I said, \"Hel-lo-o-o!\"</quote>\u2014reflects strategic choice, not naive happenstance.\n\n2. Monica\u2019s Skepticism at the Point of Intimacy  \n   \u2022 Crucially, despite her flirting, the liaison stops before completion when Clinton expresses mistrust:  \n     \u2013 \u201cNo, he stopped me when he seemed upon the cusp. / He said he wasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he / Could / Trust.\u201d  \n       <invalid_quote>No, he stopped me when he seemed upon the cusp. He said he wasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he / Could / Trust.</invalid_quote>  \n     She does not push past his doubt; she respects his boundary. That hesitation shows a two-way dynamic of caution, not an unstoppable seduction.  \n   \u2022 Afterward Monica is genuinely baffled by his lack of trust: when Linda asks, \u201cWhat did he think? That you\u2019d go blabbin\u2019 this to the whole world?\u201d Monica counters, \u201cI mean\u2014rilly!\u201d That reaction underscores her frustration at his suspicion, not her single-minded pursuit of conquest.\n\n3. Staff Concern Reinforces the Uneasy Relationship  \n   \u2022 In \u201cTime to Go,\u201d senior aides\u2014Betty Currie and Evelyn Lieberman\u2014are alarmed: \u201cIt\u2019s Miss Monica\u2019s time to go.\u201d They acknowledge her thoughtfulness but worry about her \u201cup real close and personal touch.\u201d  \n     <invalid_quote>Betty, it\u2019s Lewinsky\u2019s time to go\u2026 I don\u2019t mind a girl who thinks, it\u2019s just what she picks to drink.</invalid_quote>  \n   Their decision to remove Monica from the White House underscores that her presence raised red flags of impropriety, rather than depicting her as a \u201chome-wrecker\u201d who pursued him regardless.\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Errors of Interpretation  \n   \u2022 Cherry-picking flirtatious lyrics (\u201cI led him on\u2026 I showed him my thong\u201d) ignores the broader context: Monica\u2019s actions arise from prior knowledge and curiosity, not blind seduction.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A claims there is \u201cno lyric in which Monica questions Clinton\u2019s intentions,\u201d yet the text quotes her stopping when trust is uncertain. This is a direct contradiction.  \n   \u2022 The pizza anecdote is treated as pure seduction by Debater_A, but the libretto presents it as a friendly, calculated offering by someone who already knew the president\u2019s tastes and schedule.\n\nConclusion  \nThe musical consistently frames Monica Lewinsky as an intern who knew Bill Clinton before the affair, who carefully orchestrated access\u2014and then repeatedly hesitated and demanded trust at every critical turn. Debater_A\u2019s portrayal of her as an unreserved seductress flies in the face of these repeated moments of caution and pre-existing familiarity. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that \u201cMonica knew Bill before she became his intern and was skeptical of his conduct.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
