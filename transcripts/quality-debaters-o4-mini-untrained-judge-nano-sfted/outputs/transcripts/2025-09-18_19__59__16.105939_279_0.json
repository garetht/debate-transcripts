A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the fallacy that the author presents?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that the author\u2019s identified fallacy is the claim that \u201cthe Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy.\u201d Debater B\u2019s alternative\u2014that the fallacy is \u201csetting the employment capacity for the economy in danger\u201d\u2014misreads the text. Here\u2019s why my answer is correct and Debater B\u2019s is not.\n\n1. Core of the author\u2019s argument  \n   a. The author explains that modern macroeconomic policy is dominated by an active Fed that adjusts interest rates to hit its employment target. As he puts it:  \n      <quote> the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. </quote>  \n   b. That means any shift in savings will be countered by Fed policy: if savings rise, the Fed lowers rates to ensure investment picks up, preserving output and employment.  \n   c. Therefore, the \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d\u2014that higher savings could shrink output\u2014is a fallacy in today\u2019s world where the Fed \u201ccan double the money supply in a day\u201d to offset any deficiency in demand.\n\n2. Identifying the fallacy  \n   a. The author writes:  \n      <invalid_quote>\u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth\u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      But vulgar Keynesians do not deny Fed power; they simultaneously insist that higher savings harm growth while also blaming slow growth on overly tight Fed policy.  \n   b. That is logically inconsistent. If the Fed \u201ccan change interest rates freely\u201d and thus neutralize any change in savings, you cannot then claim savings increases are bad.  \n\n3. Why Debater B\u2019s answer fails  \n   Debater B says the fallacy is \u201csetting the employment capacity for the economy in danger.\u201d But:  \n   a. The author never argues that there\u2019s a mistaken notion of a fixed \u201cemployment capacity.\u201d Instead, he emphasizes that the Fed *chooses* the employment path.  \n   b. The alleged danger of a rigid employment ceiling is not highlighted as the fallacy; rather, the text ridicules the idea that private changes in savings *alone* can upset employment when the Fed can always offset them.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The true fallacy is the simultaneous belief that (1) saving more necessarily drags down growth and (2) the Fed cannot or does not offset that effect. These two beliefs cannot coexist given an omnipotent Fed. Debater B\u2019s caricature about a \u201cdangerous employment capacity\u201d is nowhere supported in the background text. My answer matches the author\u2019s central point about logical inconsistency regarding Fed power and the paradox of thrift.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that the fallacy is \u201cThe Fed\u2019s having complete say on interest rates cannot coexist with the idea that higher savings are bad.\u201d  But that answer mistakes a consequence for the deeper error the author highlights.  In fact, the author argues the real fallacy is the unquestioning belief that by choosing an unemployment target, the Fed can safely \u201cset the economy\u2019s capacity\u201d\u2014and that this belief is dangerous.  \n\n1.  This is the central warning of the column.  After describing how the Fed \u201cpushes [interest rates] down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating,\u201d the author says:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cPutting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision . . . Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment . . . we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   That \u201cvisible hand\u201d is precisely the mechanism by which policymakers claim to \u201cset\u201d the economy\u2019s capacity.  \n\n2.  The author repeatedly emphasizes how dangerous it is to treat the Fed\u2019s employment target as an immutable rule or natural law:  \n   \u2022  He ridicules debates conducted \u201calmost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction,\u201d noting that \u201cthe average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be.\u201d  \n   \u2022  He criticizes policy intellectuals who \u201cimagine themselves well informed\u201d yet fail to see that \u201cchanges in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy\u2014so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment.\u201d  \n\n   The underlying fallacy is the false confidence that the Fed\u2019s rate-setting automatically ensures both full employment and low inflation.  That confidence leads one to ignore real-world constraints\u2014political pressures, forecasting errors, lags, and uneven effects across sectors\u2014and to treat the Fed\u2019s chosen \u201ctarget\u201d as destiny.  That is exactly what the author calls \u201cdangerous.\u201d  \n\n3.  By contrast, my opponent\u2019s answer merely restates one side-effect of this fallacy (the clash between fixed interest control and the paradox of thrift).  But disputing whether Fed control of rates \u201ccoexists\u201d with anti-savings Keynesianism misses the author\u2019s broader point:  that faith in a single, centrally imposed employment level is a perilous oversimplification of a complex, self-correcting system.  \n\n4.  In sum, the author\u2019s true target is the hubris of believing that a small committee in Washington can dictate the economy\u2019s capacity without unintended consequences.  That is why the correct answer is \u201cSetting the employment capacity for the economy is dangerous,\u201d not merely that \u201cthe Fed can\u2019t both own interest rates and claim savings are bad.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics.

For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the fallacy that the author presents?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that the fallacy is \u201cThe Fed\u2019s having complete say on interest rates cannot coexist with the idea that higher savings are bad.\u201d  But that answer mistakes a consequence for the deeper error the author highlights.  In fact, the author argues the real fallacy is the unquestioning belief that by choosing an unemployment target, the Fed can safely \u201cset the economy\u2019s capacity\u201d\u2014and that this belief is dangerous.  \n\n1.  This is the central warning of the column.  After describing how the Fed \u201cpushes [interest rates] down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating,\u201d the author says:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cPutting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision . . . Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment . . . we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   That \u201cvisible hand\u201d is precisely the mechanism by which policymakers claim to \u201cset\u201d the economy\u2019s capacity.  \n\n2.  The author repeatedly emphasizes how dangerous it is to treat the Fed\u2019s employment target as an immutable rule or natural law:  \n   \u2022  He ridicules debates conducted \u201calmost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction,\u201d noting that \u201cthe average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be.\u201d  \n   \u2022  He criticizes policy intellectuals who \u201cimagine themselves well informed\u201d yet fail to see that \u201cchanges in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy\u2014so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment.\u201d  \n\n   The underlying fallacy is the false confidence that the Fed\u2019s rate-setting automatically ensures both full employment and low inflation.  That confidence leads one to ignore real-world constraints\u2014political pressures, forecasting errors, lags, and uneven effects across sectors\u2014and to treat the Fed\u2019s chosen \u201ctarget\u201d as destiny.  That is exactly what the author calls \u201cdangerous.\u201d  \n\n3.  By contrast, my opponent\u2019s answer merely restates one side-effect of this fallacy (the clash between fixed interest control and the paradox of thrift).  But disputing whether Fed control of rates \u201ccoexists\u201d with anti-savings Keynesianism misses the author\u2019s broader point:  that faith in a single, centrally imposed employment level is a perilous oversimplification of a complex, self-correcting system.  \n\n4.  In sum, the author\u2019s true target is the hubris of believing that a small committee in Washington can dictate the economy\u2019s capacity without unintended consequences.  That is why the correct answer is \u201cSetting the employment capacity for the economy is dangerous,\u201d not merely that \u201cthe Fed can\u2019t both own interest rates and claim savings are bad.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that the author\u2019s identified fallacy is the claim that \u201cthe Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy.\u201d Debater B\u2019s alternative\u2014that the fallacy is \u201csetting the employment capacity for the economy in danger\u201d\u2014misreads the text. Here\u2019s why my answer is correct and Debater B\u2019s is not.\n\n1. Core of the author\u2019s argument  \n   a. The author explains that modern macroeconomic policy is dominated by an active Fed that adjusts interest rates to hit its employment target. As he puts it:  \n      <quote> the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. </quote>  \n   b. That means any shift in savings will be countered by Fed policy: if savings rise, the Fed lowers rates to ensure investment picks up, preserving output and employment.  \n   c. Therefore, the \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d\u2014that higher savings could shrink output\u2014is a fallacy in today\u2019s world where the Fed \u201ccan double the money supply in a day\u201d to offset any deficiency in demand.\n\n2. Identifying the fallacy  \n   a. The author writes:  \n      <invalid_quote>\u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth\u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      But vulgar Keynesians do not deny Fed power; they simultaneously insist that higher savings harm growth while also blaming slow growth on overly tight Fed policy.  \n   b. That is logically inconsistent. If the Fed \u201ccan change interest rates freely\u201d and thus neutralize any change in savings, you cannot then claim savings increases are bad.  \n\n3. Why Debater B\u2019s answer fails  \n   Debater B says the fallacy is \u201csetting the employment capacity for the economy in danger.\u201d But:  \n   a. The author never argues that there\u2019s a mistaken notion of a fixed \u201cemployment capacity.\u201d Instead, he emphasizes that the Fed *chooses* the employment path.  \n   b. The alleged danger of a rigid employment ceiling is not highlighted as the fallacy; rather, the text ridicules the idea that private changes in savings *alone* can upset employment when the Fed can always offset them.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The true fallacy is the simultaneous belief that (1) saving more necessarily drags down growth and (2) the Fed cannot or does not offset that effect. These two beliefs cannot coexist given an omnipotent Fed. Debater B\u2019s caricature about a \u201cdangerous employment capacity\u201d is nowhere supported in the background text. My answer matches the author\u2019s central point about logical inconsistency regarding Fed power and the paradox of thrift.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

In fact, the author\u2019s entire critique is directed at the logical inconsistency of holding both (a) that higher savings necessarily depress growth and (b) that the Fed cannot or does not offset that effect by adjusting interest rates. Here\u2019s why my answer is the correct identification of the fallacy:\n\n1. The author\u2019s stated constraint on those who argue savings are bad  \n   The author makes clear that under modern central banking, any rise in desired savings can be neutralized by Fed policy:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cThe Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to\u2026 Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely, and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go\u2014end of story.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   He then says that to argue savings are bad you must show the Fed is impotent. That is the litmus test.  \n\n2. The fallacy is a pure logical contradiction  \n   \u2022  On the one hand, vulgar Keynesians assert that increased savings reduce demand, triggering lower output and employment (the \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d).  \n   \u2022  On the other hand, they also blame slow growth on an overly tight Fed\u2014insisting that if only the Fed would lower rates, investment and output would rise.  \n   Those two assertions cannot both be true if the Fed \u201ccan change interest rates freely.\u201d You cannot simultaneously say \u201chigher savings harm growth\u201d and \u201cthe Fed could stop that harm if it wanted.\u201d  \n\n3. Debater B\u2019s \u201cdangerous capacity-setting\u201d is never framed as the author\u2019s fallacy  \n   \u2022  B quotes that the Fed \u201cpushes rates\u2026 toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate,\u201d but the author uses that fact to *deflate* the power of private demand shifts\u2014not to warn of Fed overreach.  \n   \u2022  The author ridicules policy debates about job creation or destruction precisely *because* the Fed\u2019s choice already determines the average unemployment rate. He never says the mistake is believing the Fed can fix employment; he says the mistake is believing that *private savings* can fix\u2014or unfix\u2014it in spite of Fed power.  \n\n4. The core passage nails it down  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth\u2026, you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u2026 It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment.\u2026 Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely\u2026 end of story.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   The author is explicitly pointing out the internal inconsistency of claiming savings are bad while admitting an all-powerful Fed. That is the fallacy.\n\nConclusion  \nDebater B\u2019s \u201cdangerous confidence in a Fed-set capacity\u201d is at best an implication of strong central-banking power, not the *error* the author highlights. In contrast, the author clearly attacks the *logical impossibility* of combining belief in the Fed\u2019s omnipotence over rates with belief that higher savings nonetheless damage growth. My answer precisely captures that identified fallacy; Debater B\u2019s does not.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater A misreads the author\u2019s \u201cfallacy.\u201d  The column is not primarily about an internal inconsistency between \u201cFed omnipotence\u201d and \u201cparadox of thrift.\u201d  Rather, it\u2019s a warning that entrusting a tiny committee with \u201csetting\u201d the economy\u2019s capacity\u2014its noninflationary unemployment rate\u2014is itself a dangerous illusion.  \n\n2. The author\u2019s own words underline this:  \n   \u2022  He contrasts the classical \u201cinvisible hand\u201d with \u201cthe visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate.\u201d  That is not an incidental side\u2010note; it is the very heart of his critique.  \n   \u2022  He deplores debates conducted \u201calmost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction,\u201d oblivious to the fact that \u201cthe average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be.\u201d  That complaint is aimed squarely at the hubris of fixing employment by decree.  \n\n3. Why A\u2019s focus on the paradox of thrift is too narrow:  \n   \u2022  Yes, the author demolishes the idea that \u201chigher savings always drag down output\u201d once \u201cthe Fed can double the money supply in a day.\u201d  But that serves only to illustrate his broader point: nothing about the economy is self-correcting or safe once you assume a fixed employment target can be imposed.  \n   \u2022  Debater A says the fallacy lies in believing both that \u201csavings hurt growth\u201d and that \u201cthe Fed can\u2019t offset them.\u201d  Yet the column\u2019s target is not Keynesian self-contradiction but the more fundamental conceit that anyone\u2014even Greenspan\u2014can truly \u201cset\u201d capacity without grievous unintended effects.  \n\n4. The true \u201cdanger\u201d is policy overconfidence:  \n   \u2022  By treating the Fed\u2019s chosen unemployment rate as destiny, we ignore forecasting errors, political pressures, sectoral imbalances, and lags.  \n   \u2022  That overconfidence\u2014\u201cthe visible hand\u201d thinking it can micromanage capacity\u2014is exactly what the author labels a \u201cdangerous\u201d fallacy.  \n\n5. Conclusion.  Debater A\u2019s answer reduces the column to a quibble over monetary offset.  But the author\u2019s animating concern is the peril of believing a small committee can dictate the economy\u2019s capacity.  That is why the correct description of his fallacy is \u201csetting the employment capacity for the economy is dangerous.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
