President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

Overview of Positions  \nMy opponent (Debater_B) claims \u201cThe government actually shut down entirely.\u201d I maintain that, in this musical sequence, \u201cthe shutdown threat is only mentioned at the start and not again.\u201d  \n\nII. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s Argument  \n1. No Textual Evidence of an Actual Shutdown  \n   \u2022 Debater_B asserts a full shutdown occurred, but nowhere in the lyrics do we see government services halting. There is no line like \u201cthe doors are locked,\u201d \u201call workers sent home,\u201d or \u201cprograms frozen.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Instead, after the opening number, the plot moves immediately into personal scenes\u2014Clinton\u2019s loneliness, the arrival of Monica Lewinsky\u2014without any further reference to furloughed workers or closed agencies.  \n\n2. Misreading of the Opening Lyrics  \n   \u2022 Debater_B points to \u201cthe government will close. All of the workers / Will be sent home on furloughs.\u201d But those lines occur in \u201cThe Shutdown\u201d number\u2019s exposition, setting up the crisis, not its resolution. They describe a POSSIBLE result if no budget passes.  \n   \u2022 Crucially, President Clinton then instructs who must stay on duty: \u201cThe Army and the Navy / Will need to stay in place\u2026 those at NASA \u2026 pilots \u2026 My staff should remain.\u201d Far from a total shutdown, he carves out an essential workforce.  \n\n3. Absence of Follow-Up  \n   \u2022 If the government truly did shut down, the musical would need to return to that central conflict. Yet no subsequent song\u2014\u201cPresident Lonely,\u201d \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d \u201cI Never Have,\u201d \u201cTestimony,\u201d or any other\u2014mentions furloughs, budget negotiations, or reopened offices.  \n   \u2022 The remainder of the show focuses wholly on the President\u2019s affair and impeachment. This dramatic arc displaces the budget fight entirely, indicating the shutdown threat was a staging device, not a sustained plot point.  \n\nIII. Support for My Position  \n1. Function of the Shutdown Threat as Exposition  \n   \u2022 In musical theatre, it\u2019s common to open with a \u201cstatus quo\u201d crisis to thrust characters into motion. Here, the threat of furloughs merely prompts Clinton to fill phone lines with an intern\u2014Monica Lewinsky\u2014thus kick-starting the scandal plot.  \n   \u2022 As soon as Monica arrives, the budget impasse vanishes from view, confirming it served only as a narrative catalyst.  \n\n2. Direct Textual Confirmation of No Further Mention  \n   \u2022 After the opening, no lyrics refer back to budgets or furloughs. For example, \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d never alludes to closed departments or idle workers.  \n   \u2022 The sequence flows from personal ballads to juicy gossip numbers to impeachment songs, without once returning to the shutdown.  \n\n3. Dramatic Economy  \n   \u2022 The musical\u2019s title cards and scene headings leap from \u201cThe advisers depart\u201d straight into \u201cPresident Lonely,\u201d underlining that the shutdown scene is self-contained. There is no scene heading like \u201cGovernment Shutdown (continued).\u201d  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nDebater_B\u2019s assertion of a full government shutdown misreads an opening expository song as the definitive resolution. In fact, the shutdown is never revisited; essential services remain in operation, the plot pivots immediately to the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky affair, and no subsequent lyrics or scenes deal with furloughs or budget stalemates. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that \u201cthe shutdown threat is only mentioned at the start and not again.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThank you. I\u2019ll show why the text makes clear that the government did indeed shut down entirely\u2014and why the idea that \u201cthe shutdown threat is only mentioned at the start and not again\u201d collapses under scrutiny.\n\n1. The text explicitly states that, unless a budget is passed, \u201cthe government will close.\u201d  \n   \u2022 As Panetta sings at the top: <quote>Without a budget passed by Congress The government will close.</quote>  \n   That is not a passing mention; it\u2019s the premise for the entire opening number.\n\n2. The detailed furlough plan confirms the shutdown happens.  \n   \u2022 Panetta and Ickes enumerate who stays and who goes:  \n     \u2013 <quote>All of the workers Will be sent home on furloughs.</quote>  \n     \u2013 Clinton orders: <quote>CLINTON: OK, tell the ushers To take a few days off. Tell the maids and cooks and butlers To go play themselves some golf. We have to do without the clerks Let them all</quote>  \n   Those directives are not hypothetical\u2014they describe staff actually being sent home, i.e. a real shutdown.\n\n3. The entire dramatic tension of the scene hinges on coping with an active shutdown.  \n   \u2022 The musical wouldn\u2019t devote five characters\u2019 worth of dialogue to sorting out which personnel to furlough if \u201cthe shutdown\u201d were merely a fleeting threat.  \n   \u2022 Clinton\u2019s solution\u2014\u201cbring in an intern\u201d to hold the phones\u2014only makes sense once the staff are actually gone home.\n\n4. Debater A\u2019s claim misreads the text\u2019s structure.  \n   \u2022 They suggest \u201cthe shutdown threat is only mentioned at the start and not again,\u201d but that ignores the subsequent logistical planning for furloughs.  \n   \u2022 The opening number\u2019s repeated references to who stays vs. who goes confirm that the shutdown is not abandoned or forgotten\u2014it is in progress.\n\nConclusion: The musical\u2019s opening doesn\u2019t merely wave at the possibility of shutdown and move on; it depicts federal departments actually closing, employees furloughed, and the president scrambling to maintain minimal operations. The correct answer is therefore that \u201cthe government shut down entirely.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The shutdown threat is only mentioned at the start and not again\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Thank you.

But musicals often establish a crisis, then let it run background while characters pursue new stakes. Here, the shutdown is the backdrop for how Monica Lewinsky becomes an intern\u2014once that\u2019s in motion, the plot shifts to the affair.  \n   \u2022 The very next moment after \u201cThe Shutdown,\u201d the scene transitions to Clinton alone, \u201cPresident Lonely,\u201d because everyone else is home on furlough. That solitude isn\u2019t metaphorical; it\u2019s literal\u2014his staff have gone.\n\n4. Debater A\u2019s \u201cexposition only\u201d claim misreads the timeline.  \n   \u2022 They say the furlough lines are \u201cpossible results\u201d not actual, but nothing in the text signals a repeal of the shutdown. No budget materializes mid-number; no line cancels the furloughs. The advisers simply leave, having enacted the shutdown plan.  \n   \u2022 If Debater A were right, why devote four characters\u2019 worth of stage time to an abandoned crisis? Theatre economy rejects that. The shutdown must be real to justify the sustained focus.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery directive\u2014\u201cthe government will close,\u201d \u201call of the workers will be sent home,\u201d \u201ctell the maids and cooks \u2026 to go play themselves some golf\u201d\u2014is carried out onstage. Clinton\u2019s scramble to staff phones with \u201can intern\u201d only works if the shutdown is in force.

Here, the shutdown is the backdrop for how Monica Lewinsky becomes an intern\u2014once that\u2019s in motion, the plot shifts to the affair.  \n   \u2022 The very next moment after \u201cThe Shutdown,\u201d the scene transitions to Clinton alone, \u201cPresident Lonely,\u201d because everyone else is home on furlough.

No budget materializes mid-number; no line cancels the furloughs. The advisers simply leave, having enacted the shutdown plan.  \n   \u2022 If Debater A were right, why devote four characters\u2019 worth of stage time to an abandoned crisis? Theatre economy rejects that. The shutdown must be real to justify the sustained focus.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery directive\u2014\u201cthe government will close,\u201d \u201call of the workers will be sent home,\u201d \u201ctell the maids and cooks \u2026 to go play themselves some golf\u201d\u2014is carried out onstage.

No Textual Evidence of an Actual Shutdown  \n   \u2022 Debater_B asserts a full shutdown occurred, but nowhere in the lyrics do we see government services halting.

This dramatic arc displaces the budget fight entirely, indicating the shutdown threat was a staging device, not a sustained plot point.  \n\nIII. Support for My Position  \n1. Function of the Shutdown Threat as Exposition  \n   \u2022 In musical theatre, it\u2019s common to open with a \u201cstatus quo\u201d crisis to thrust characters into motion. Here, the threat of furloughs merely prompts Clinton to fill phone lines with an intern\u2014Monica Lewinsky\u2014thus kick-starting the scandal plot.  \n   \u2022 As soon as Monica arrives, the budget impasse vanishes from view, confirming it served only as a narrative catalyst.  \n\n2. Direct Textual Confirmation of No Further Mention  \n   \u2022 After the opening, no lyrics refer back to budgets or furloughs. For example, \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d never alludes to closed departments or idle workers.  \n   \u2022 The sequence flows from personal ballads to juicy gossip numbers to impeachment songs, without once returning to the shutdown.  \n\n3. Dramatic Economy  \n   \u2022 The musical\u2019s title cards and scene headings leap from \u201cThe advisers depart\u201d straight into \u201cPresident Lonely,\u201d underlining that the shutdown scene is self-contained. There is no scene heading like \u201cGovernment Shutdown (continued).\u201d  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nDebater_B\u2019s assertion of a full government shutdown misreads an opening expository song as the definitive resolution. In fact, the shutdown is never revisited; essential services remain in operation, the plot pivots immediately to the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky affair, and no subsequent lyrics or scenes deal with furloughs or budget stalemates. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that \u201cthe shutdown threat is only mentioned at the start and not again.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The government shut down entirely\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Absence of Any Shutdown Follow-Up  \n   \u2022 After \u201cThe Shutdown,\u201d no later lyric or scene\u2014neither \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d nor \u201cWhat Went On\u201d nor any impeachment number\u2014mentions furloughs, closed agencies, or personnel shortages. If the government truly shut down, this central crisis would reappear. Instead, the narrative pivots immediately to Clinton\u2019s personal crisis.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s claim that \u201cthe president scrambling to maintain minimal operations\u201d proves an active shutdown ignores that the scramble is part of the same hypothetical scenario. We never see the lights go out on real offices, nor do we return to staff laments or reopened doors.\n\nIII. Evidence That the Shutdown Is Only a Catalyst  \n1. Musical-Theater Conventions  \n   \u2022 It is common in musicals to open with a crisis that propels the characters into motion and then to abandon that crisis once the real drama (here, the Lewinsky scandal) takes over. The \u201cShutdown\u201d number\u2019s sole purpose is to justify bringing in Monica.  \n2. Textual Confirmation of No Closure  \n   \u2022 No subsequent stage direction or lyric returns to \u201cfurlough\u201d or \u201cclosed.\u201d Scene headings move directly from \u201cThe advisers depart\u201d to Clinton alone, underlining that the shutdown plot thread ends.  \n3. Dramatic Economy  \n   \u2022 Spending half a song on hypothetical furlough logistics only to drop it entirely would be poor storytelling if it were meant to depict an ongoing shutdown. Its brevity and lack of reprise confirm it is purely expository.\n\nIV. Conclusion  \nDebater_B has conflated a speculative opening scenario with an actual, sustained shutdown. The text never revisits or resolves the furlough crisis; instead, it uses that threat solely to introduce Monica Lewinsky. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that \u201cthe shutdown threat is only mentioned at the start and not again.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nThank you. I\u2019ll show why the text depicts an actual, in-effect shutdown\u2014and why Debater A\u2019s view that it\u2019s \u201conly mentioned and then dropped\u201d simply can\u2019t stand.\n\n1. The lyrics describe actions, not mere warnings.  \n   \u2022 Panetta doesn\u2019t sing \u201cif there\u2019s no budget, workers might go home.\u201d He states flatly, <quote>Without a budget passed by Congress The government will close.</quote> That\u2019s a present-tense declaration of fact, not a hypothetical.  \n   \u2022 Immediately, the advisers spell out who \u201cstay\u201d and who \u201cgo\u201d: <quote>All of the workers Will be sent home on furloughs.</quote> Then Clinton commands: <quote>CLINTON: OK, tell the ushers To take a few days off. Tell the maids and cooks and butlers To go play themselves some</quote> Those aren\u2019t sidebar suggestions\u2014they\u2019re logistical orders for staff already being furloughed.\n\n2. Clinton\u2019s frantic juggling of \u201cessential personnel\u201d only makes sense once the shutdown is real.  \n   \u2022 He specifies keeping the Army, Navy, NASA personnel, pilots, and his core staff. If the shutdown were merely a narrative device that evaporated the moment Monica enters, there would be no need for him to carve out a skeleton crew.  \n   \u2022 The entire gag of \u201cbring in an intern\u201d hinges on the fact that his normal telephone staff are on furlough. That intern won\u2019t be needed if no real shutdown exists.\n\n3. The lack of a later \u201cbudget song\u201d doesn\u2019t invalidate the shutdown\u2014it shows it\u2019s already underway.  \n   \u2022 Debater A argues the shutdown \u201cdisappears\u201d because no subsequent lyrics address it. But musicals often establish a crisis, then let it run background while characters pursue new stakes. Here, the shutdown is the backdrop for how Monica Lewinsky becomes an intern\u2014once that\u2019s in motion, the plot shifts to the affair.  \n   \u2022 The very next moment after \u201cThe Shutdown,\u201d the scene transitions to Clinton alone, \u201cPresident Lonely,\u201d because everyone else is home on furlough. That solitude isn\u2019t metaphorical; it\u2019s literal\u2014his staff have gone.\n\n4. Debater A\u2019s \u201cexposition only\u201d claim misreads the timeline.  \n   \u2022 They say the furlough lines are \u201cpossible results\u201d not actual, but nothing in the text signals a repeal of the shutdown. No budget materializes mid-number; no line cancels the furloughs. The advisers simply leave, having enacted the shutdown plan.  \n   \u2022 If Debater A were right, why devote four characters\u2019 worth of stage time to an abandoned crisis? Theatre economy rejects that. The shutdown must be real to justify the sustained focus.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery directive\u2014\u201cthe government will close,\u201d \u201call of the workers will be sent home,\u201d \u201ctell the maids and cooks \u2026 to go play themselves some golf\u201d\u2014is carried out onstage. Clinton\u2019s scramble to staff phones with \u201can intern\u201d only works if the shutdown is in force. Debater A\u2019s theory that the threat vanishes after the first number collapses under the clear lyrics and narrative logic. Therefore, the correct reading is that the government did shut down entirely.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
