{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 235, "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the fallacy that the author presents?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent says the fallacy here is merely an inconsistent story about Fed power versus the harm of higher savings. But that misses the author\u2019s real point: the dangerous mistake is treating the Fed\u2019s target unemployment\u2014or what the author calls the \u201cnoninflationary unemployment rate\u201d\u2014as if it were a natural limit on the economy\u2019s capacity. In other words, it is dangerous to set the economy\u2019s employment capacity by decree.\n\n1. The author criticizes \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d not because it denies Fed power, but because it elevates Fed policy into an economy-wide speed governor. He writes that, once you admit that \u201cthe Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates \u2026, you can hardly dispute [its] power.\u201d Yet he warns that this very power tempts us to confuse policy targets with physical limits. Quoting him:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cInstead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment \u2026 we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   The fallacy lies in thinking that because the Fed can nudge rates, it therefore sets the economy\u2019s true employment capacity\u2014when in fact that capacity depends on technology, demographics, institutions, and countless other factors outside the Fed\u2019s control.\n\n2. Throughout the essay, the author shows that once we accept a Fed-defined \u201ctarget,\u201d we stop debating real structural reforms. He laments that policy debates\u2014over NAFTA, savings, or trade\u2014are reduced to \u201cwhat Greenspan wants,\u201d ignoring that long-run employment depends on investment in education, infrastructure, and innovation. Treating Fed policy as destiny distracts us from the real levers of growth.\n\n3. My opponent\u2019s focus on the supposed contradiction between Fed power and the paradox of thrift misconstrues the author\u2019s critique. The author explicitly grants the Fed broad authority, then asks: is it wise to let a single institution define our maximum employment? He argues it is not. That is the \u201cdangerous\u201d fallacy: conflating a policy lever with an economic horizon.\n\nTherefore, the correct identification of the fallacy is that we have handed over our concept of full employment\u2014or employment capacity\u2014to the Fed\u2019s short-run targets, mistaking a policy instrument for an economic limit. Debater_B\u2019s framing misses this: it\u2019s not that Fed power conflicts with savings theory, but that treating the Fed\u2019s unemployment goal as the economy\u2019s natural ceiling is inherently dangerous.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s Answer Is Irrelevant and Unsubstantiated  \n1. Debater_A claims the fallacy is \u201cSetting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous.\u201d  \n   a. The author never argues that \u201cemployment capacity\u201d itself is dangerous or mis\u2010set; he argues that caricature Keynesians wrongly assume higher savings must shrink employment because \u201cthe Fed\u201d cannot offset it.  \n   b. There is no passage in the text suggesting we mismeasure or mis\u2010target \u201cemployment capacity.\u201d Instead, the author\u2019s sole focus is on the internal contradiction of believing both (1) the Fed can fully control interest rates and (2) that higher savings necessarily reduce growth.  \n\n2. Debater_A offers no citation or logical chain from the background to support \u201cdangerous employment capacity.\u201d Without direct evidence, that answer is a guess, not grounded in the author\u2019s argument.  \n\nII. The True Fallacy: Incompatibility of Fed Control with \u201cSavings Are Bad\u201d  \n1. The author states that vulgar Keynesians insist \u201creduced consumer spending is always a bad thing\u201d and rely on paradoxes like the \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d and the \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWhat has made it into the public consciousness... is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n2. He then shows that in the real world the Federal Reserve actively manages interest rates to offset shifts in savings: <quote>(the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to)</quote> and \u201cinterest rates are normally determined by how high [Greenspan] thinks [employment] can safely go\u2014end of story.\u201d  \n3. Hence, if the Fed truly has the power to counter any rise in savings by lowering rates, then the claim that \u201chigher savings will actually reduce growth\u201d is self\u2010contradictory.  \n   a. To hold both \u201cFed has complete say over interest rates\u201d and \u201cincreased savings must depress output\u201d is logically impossible unless one denies the Fed\u2019s effectiveness.  \n   b. The author explicitly demands that to defend \u201csavings are bad,\u201d one must either claim \u201cinterest rates have no effect on spending\u201d or \u201cpotential savings overwhelm any feasible rate cut.\u201d Neither position is endorsed for modern U.S. conditions.  \n\nIII. Why This Matters  \n1. The central target of the essay is \u201cvulgar Keynesianism,\u201d which conflates short\u2010run demand deficits with permanent harm\u2014despite the Fed\u2019s ability to neutralize them.  \n2. Thus, the core fallacy is precisely that contradictory belief:  \n   \u2013 Claim A: The Fed can always set interest rates to stabilize employment.  \n   \u2013 Claim B: Therefore, higher savings nonetheless reduce growth.  \n   That contradiction is the \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d fallacy the author exposes.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s \u201cdangerous employment capacity\u201d answer has no basis in the text. The author\u2019s entire argument is devoted to showing that belief in the Fed\u2019s omnipotence over rates cannot coexist with the belief that a higher savings rate inevitably injures the economy. Therefore the only defensible answer is:  \n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Those two positions cannot coexist: if the Fed truly neutralizes any rise in savings by lowering rates, then higher savings cannot \u201cultimately reduce growth.\u201d  \n   a. To claim otherwise forces you to deny either the Fed\u2019s power or the basic effect of rates on investment\u2014both of which the author shows are untenable for modern U.S. conditions.  \n   b. He writes that, to rescue the paradox of thrift, one must argue that \u201cinterest rates have no effect on spending\u201d or that \u201cpotential savings\u2026overwhelm any feasible rate cut\u201d\u2014positions he rejects for America today.\n\nIII. Why Debater_A\u2019s \u201cDangerous Capacity\u201d Theory Fails  \n1. The essay never broaches long-term capacity, demographics, technology, or structural reform. Debater_A\u2019s structural\u2010capacity critique projects an absent theme onto the text.  \n2. All examples\u2014NAFTA debates, Greider\u2019s book, Business Week contrarian commentaries\u2014are reproaches of crude demand-deficit reasoning, not misplaced faith in Fed limits.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s answer invents a \u201cfallacy\u201d of confusing policy targets with natural ceilings that the author nowhere discusses. In contrast, the entire column zeroes in on the self-contradiction of believing both that the Fed can fully manage rates and that rising savings must depress growth.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the fallacy that the author presents?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s Answer Is Irrelevant and Unsubstantiated  \n1. Debater_A claims the fallacy is \u201cSetting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous.\u201d  \n   a. The author never argues that \u201cemployment capacity\u201d itself is dangerous or mis\u2010set; he argues that caricature Keynesians wrongly assume higher savings must shrink employment because \u201cthe Fed\u201d cannot offset it.  \n   b. There is no passage in the text suggesting we mismeasure or mis\u2010target \u201cemployment capacity.\u201d Instead, the author\u2019s sole focus is on the internal contradiction of believing both (1) the Fed can fully control interest rates and (2) that higher savings necessarily reduce growth.  \n\n2. Debater_A offers no citation or logical chain from the background to support \u201cdangerous employment capacity.\u201d Without direct evidence, that answer is a guess, not grounded in the author\u2019s argument.  \n\nII. The True Fallacy: Incompatibility of Fed Control with \u201cSavings Are Bad\u201d  \n1. The author states that vulgar Keynesians insist \u201creduced consumer spending is always a bad thing\u201d and rely on paradoxes like the \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d and the \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWhat has made it into the public consciousness... is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n2. He then shows that in the real world the Federal Reserve actively manages interest rates to offset shifts in savings: <quote>(the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to)</quote> and \u201cinterest rates are normally determined by how high [Greenspan] thinks [employment] can safely go\u2014end of story.\u201d  \n3. Hence, if the Fed truly has the power to counter any rise in savings by lowering rates, then the claim that \u201chigher savings will actually reduce growth\u201d is self\u2010contradictory.  \n   a. To hold both \u201cFed has complete say over interest rates\u201d and \u201cincreased savings must depress output\u201d is logically impossible unless one denies the Fed\u2019s effectiveness.  \n   b. The author explicitly demands that to defend \u201csavings are bad,\u201d one must either claim \u201cinterest rates have no effect on spending\u201d or \u201cpotential savings overwhelm any feasible rate cut.\u201d Neither position is endorsed for modern U.S. conditions.  \n\nIII. Why This Matters  \n1. The central target of the essay is \u201cvulgar Keynesianism,\u201d which conflates short\u2010run demand deficits with permanent harm\u2014despite the Fed\u2019s ability to neutralize them.  \n2. Thus, the core fallacy is precisely that contradictory belief:  \n   \u2013 Claim A: The Fed can always set interest rates to stabilize employment.  \n   \u2013 Claim B: Therefore, higher savings nonetheless reduce growth.  \n   That contradiction is the \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d fallacy the author exposes.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s \u201cdangerous employment capacity\u201d answer has no basis in the text. The author\u2019s entire argument is devoted to showing that belief in the Fed\u2019s omnipotence over rates cannot coexist with the belief that a higher savings rate inevitably injures the economy. Therefore the only defensible answer is:  \n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent says the fallacy here is merely an inconsistent story about Fed power versus the harm of higher savings. But that misses the author\u2019s real point: the dangerous mistake is treating the Fed\u2019s target unemployment\u2014or what the author calls the \u201cnoninflationary unemployment rate\u201d\u2014as if it were a natural limit on the economy\u2019s capacity. In other words, it is dangerous to set the economy\u2019s employment capacity by decree.\n\n1. The author criticizes \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d not because it denies Fed power, but because it elevates Fed policy into an economy-wide speed governor. He writes that, once you admit that \u201cthe Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates \u2026, you can hardly dispute [its] power.\u201d Yet he warns that this very power tempts us to confuse policy targets with physical limits. Quoting him:  \n   <invalid_quote>\u201cInstead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment \u2026 we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   The fallacy lies in thinking that because the Fed can nudge rates, it therefore sets the economy\u2019s true employment capacity\u2014when in fact that capacity depends on technology, demographics, institutions, and countless other factors outside the Fed\u2019s control.\n\n2. Throughout the essay, the author shows that once we accept a Fed-defined \u201ctarget,\u201d we stop debating real structural reforms. He laments that policy debates\u2014over NAFTA, savings, or trade\u2014are reduced to \u201cwhat Greenspan wants,\u201d ignoring that long-run employment depends on investment in education, infrastructure, and innovation. Treating Fed policy as destiny distracts us from the real levers of growth.\n\n3. My opponent\u2019s focus on the supposed contradiction between Fed power and the paradox of thrift misconstrues the author\u2019s critique. The author explicitly grants the Fed broad authority, then asks: is it wise to let a single institution define our maximum employment? He argues it is not. That is the \u201cdangerous\u201d fallacy: conflating a policy lever with an economic horizon.\n\nTherefore, the correct identification of the fallacy is that we have handed over our concept of full employment\u2014or employment capacity\u2014to the Fed\u2019s short-run targets, mistaking a policy instrument for an economic limit. Debater_B\u2019s framing misses this: it\u2019s not that Fed power conflicts with savings theory, but that treating the Fed\u2019s unemployment goal as the economy\u2019s natural ceiling is inherently dangerous.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

The author\u2019s entire argument is devoted to showing that belief in the Fed\u2019s omnipotence over rates cannot coexist with the belief that a higher savings rate inevitably injures the economy. Therefore the only defensible answer is:  \n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_B Misreads the Author\u2019s Central Warning  \n   a. The author does not confine his critique to a technical contradiction about Fed power and savings. He repeatedly warns that by elevating the Fed\u2019s short\u2010run unemployment target into the economy\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d ceiling, we accept a dangerously narrow view of what our economy can achieve.  \n   b. As the author puts it, \u201cInstead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment \u2026 we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years.\u201d This is not mere description of Fed mechanics; it is an explicit caution that we are mistaking a policy instrument for a fundamental economic limit.  \n\n2. The Fallacy Is the Confusion of Target with Capacity  \n   a. The crux of the essay is that once we let the Fed\u2019s politically chosen \u201cnoninflationary unemployment rate\u201d become our definition of full employment, we abandon questions of productivity, innovation, and structural reform.  \n   b. The author scolds public debate for being reduced to \u201cwhat Greenspan wants,\u201d instead of tackling trade, education, infrastructure, and technology. That reductionism\u2014the idea that our potential output is whatever interest\u2010rate policy permits\u2014is precisely what he calls dangerous vulgar Keynesianism.  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cTechnical Contradiction\u201d Framing Misses the Broader Point  \n   a. Yes, the author shows that a coherent model must either deny Fed efficacy or accept that higher savings aren\u2019t harmful. But those are sub\u2010points under his larger theme: by focusing on mechanical offsetting of demand swings, we risk institutionalizing a static limit on growth.  \n   b. Debater_B insists the essay is \u201csolely\u201d about an internal inconsistency. Yet the author ends by demanding that if we truly believe savings are bad, we must argue away Fed power\u2014or else concede that savings feed investment. That demand is a rhetorical device to expose how narrow and self\u2010defeating it is to let monetary policy alone define our economic horizons.  \n\n4. Why \u201cSetting the Employment Capacity\u201d Is the Correct Label  \n   a. The essay\u2019s repeated contrast of \u201cinvisible hand\u201d versus \u201cvisible hand\u201d makes clear that the real peril is not a mere modeling glitch but a shift in how society conceives of its own capabilities.  \n   b. By mistaking a discretionary policy target for a natural limit, we tacitly accept lower ambitions for growth, full employment, and social welfare. That is the dangerous fallacy the author spotlighted.  \n\nTherefore, the fallacy is not a narrow logical inconsistency about Fed power and thrift, but the far more consequential error of treating the Fed\u2019s short\u2010run unemployment goal as the economy\u2019s immutable capacity. \u201cSetting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\u201d accurately captures the author\u2019s warning; Debater_B\u2019s focus on a technical contradiction misses the forest for the trees.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A Misreads the Essay\u2019s Focus  \n1. Debater_A claims the fallacy is \u201ctreating the Fed\u2019s target unemployment as the economy\u2019s capacity.\u201d But nowhere does the author warn against confusing policy targets with physical limits.  \n   a. The author applauds the Fed\u2019s power (\u201cyou can hardly dispute his power\u201d); he never suggests that treating the Fed\u2019s target as a ceiling is itself a flaw.  \n   b. Instead, every paradox he describes\u2014\u201cparadox of thrift,\u201d \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d\u2014depends on believing (i) the Fed can fully offset demand shifts via rates, and (ii) higher savings must therefore depress output.  \n\n2. Debater_A supplies no passage where the author laments an over-reliance on Fed targets as \u201ctragic\u201d or \u201cdangerous.\u201d The only \u201cdanger\u201d he invokes is intellectual: the persistence of crude, contradictory Keynesian caricatures.\n\nII. The True Logical Contradiction Highlighted by the Author  \n1. The author defines vulgar Keynesianism as insisting simultaneously:  \n   \u2013 \u201cReduced consumer spending is always a bad thing.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWhat has made it into the public consciousness\u2026is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 Yet also conceding that \u201cthe Fed can double the money supply in a day,\u201d and thus \u201cinterest rates are normally determined by how high [it] thinks employment can safely go\u2014end of story.\u201d <quote>(the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to)</quote>  \n\n2. Those two positions cannot coexist: if the Fed truly neutralizes any rise in savings by lowering rates, then higher savings cannot \u201cultimately reduce growth.\u201d  \n   a. To claim otherwise forces you to deny either the Fed\u2019s power or the basic effect of rates on investment\u2014both of which the author shows are untenable for modern U.S. conditions.  \n   b. He writes that, to rescue the paradox of thrift, one must argue that \u201cinterest rates have no effect on spending\u201d or that \u201cpotential savings\u2026overwhelm any feasible rate cut\u201d\u2014positions he rejects for America today.\n\nIII. Why Debater_A\u2019s \u201cDangerous Capacity\u201d Theory Fails  \n1. The essay never broaches long-term capacity, demographics, technology, or structural reform. Debater_A\u2019s structural\u2010capacity critique projects an absent theme onto the text.  \n2. All examples\u2014NAFTA debates, Greider\u2019s book, Business Week contrarian commentaries\u2014are reproaches of crude demand-deficit reasoning, not misplaced faith in Fed limits.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s answer invents a \u201cfallacy\u201d of confusing policy targets with natural ceilings that the author nowhere discusses. In contrast, the entire column zeroes in on the self-contradiction of believing both that the Fed can fully manage rates and that rising savings must depress growth. That is the precise fallacy the author exposes.  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer remains:  \n\u201cThe Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n", "failed": false}}]}
