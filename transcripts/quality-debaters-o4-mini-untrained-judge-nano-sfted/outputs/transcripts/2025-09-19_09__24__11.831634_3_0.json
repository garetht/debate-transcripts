The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n", "question": "The author believes that athletic ability changes over time mainly due to:", "first_debater_answer": "Natural selection and genetics", "second_debater_answer": "Environment", "debate_identifier": "The Olympic Gene Pool_The author believes that athletic ability changes over time mainly due to:"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though.

The author never \u201csystematically rejects genetic explanations.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Debater_B quotes <quote> what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. </quote> but ignores the very next sections where the author returns to genetics: \u201cGenetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study\u2026\u201d and introduces \u201chybrid vigor\u201d as a driver of performance gains.

Identical twins share the same genes; the author\u2019s point is that a better environment allows those genes to be fully realized. Without the genetic template, improved nutrition and health care are powerless to produce elite athletes.  \n\nII. Genetics and Natural Selection Are Central  \n1. Heritable Traits Set the Ultimate Limits and Provide the Raw Material  \n   \u2013 Oxygen uptake (VO\u2082 max), muscle-fiber composition, tendon elasticity, bone density\u2014these are genetically determined. The author explicitly acknowledges this:  \n     <quote> One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" </quote>  \n   \u2013 Environment optimizes function but cannot manufacture the extra fast-twitch fibers or superior VO\u2082 max that only particular alleles provide.  \n2. Hybrid Vigor Is an Ongoing Genetic Force  \n   \u2013 The admixture of previously isolated human populations is \u201can accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks\u201d that produces offspring superior to either parent line. This is a genetic, not environmental, phenomenon.  \n   \u2013 The text states: <invalid_quote>\u201cCattle breeders have known about this for a long time\u2026Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \u2018better\u2019\u2026This does not require natural selection.\u201d</invalid_quote> By analogy, human populations mixing on a global scale will continue to generate superior athletic genotypes regardless of nutrition or training.  \n3. Natural Selection Still Shapes Our Athletic Genes  \n   \u2013 Even if top athletes have fewer children today, historic selective pressures (e.g., endurance in hunter-gatherer societies) have already enriched alleles favoring stamina and speed. These alleles remain prevalent in modern gene pools.  \n   \u2013 Modern scientists have identified genetic markers\u2014such as variants in the ACE gene or ACTN3 \u201csprinter gene\u201d\u2014that correlate strongly with elite performance. Such discoveries confirm that performance has a substantial heritable component.  \n\nIII. Why Environment-Only Cannot Account for Continuous Gains  \n1.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that athletic ability changes over time mainly due to:\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Environment\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Natural selection and genetics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Natural selection and genetics\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Flaws in the \u201cEnvironment Only\u201d Argument  \n1. Author explicitly invokes genetic factors  \n   \u2013 After detailing nutrition, health care, and demographics, the author concedes \u201cnature\u201d still matters: \u201cGenetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cGenetic variation exists \u2026 and the ability to run quickly would be no exception.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 He then introduces \u201chybrid vigor\u201d as a genetic explanation for rising athletic potential: <quote> modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. </quote>  \n   \u21d2 If environment were truly \u201cmain,\u201d why devote two full paragraphs to genetic mechanisms?  \n\n2. Environment cannot explain plateauing  \n   \u2013 The author compares humans to racehorses: progress eventually hits a biomechanical ceiling despite ever-better training and feed. He argues the same limit will constrain us.  \n   \u21d2 Only genetic endowment (bone strength, muscle physiology) sets that ultimate ceiling; environment merely approaches it.  \n\nII. Positive Case for Genetics/Natural Selection  \n1. Genetic variation underlies all athletic traits  \n   \u2013 Skeletal structure, VO\u2082 max, fast-twitch fiber proportion\u2014these are heritable. The author\u2019s own example of extra toes illustrates: <invalid_quote>\u201cOne genetic factor \u2026 inheritance of extra fingers or toes \u2026 genes have affected athletic performance.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u21d2 Without genetics, no individual difference to select or improve upon.  \n\n2. Hybrid vigor is an ongoing driver  \n   \u2013 Cross-population admixture boosts mean performance by combining complementary gene pools.  \n   \u2013 This effect is independent of training, nutrition, or healthcare\u2014\u201can accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cTake two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \u2018better\u2019 \u2026 This does not require natural selection.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u21d2 Hybrid vigor accelerates record-breaking independently of secular environmental trends.  \n\n3. Natural selection still operates, even today  \n   \u2013 Though top athletes may have fewer children, historic selection shaped our endurance and sprint-specialized ancestors.  \n   \u2013 Genetic predispositions (e.g. East African high-altitude adaptations) confer real advantages beyond mere training background.  \n\nIII. Objections to Purely Environmental Account  \n1. Environmental improvements are leveling off in developed countries  \n   \u2013 Once nutrition and healthcare reach high standards, further gains from environment are marginal.  \n   \u2013 Yet records continue to fall\u2014only genetics (hybrid vigor + latent variation) can explain continued improvement.  \n\n2. Environment cannot generate new heritable potential  \n   \u2013 Better shoes, diets, or schooling optimize existing machinery; they cannot create the extra fast-twitch fibers or novel muscle-enzyme variants that genetics can.  \n\nConclusion  \nWhile environmental factors (nutrition, healthcare, demographics) play an important supporting role, the author\u2019s own text shows that genetic variation, natural selection, and especially hybrid vigor are the principal engines driving long-term improvement in athletic performance. Environment sets the stage, but genetics determines the show.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that \u201cnatural selection and genetics\u201d are the primary drivers of secular improvements in athletic performance, but the text repeatedly and emphatically attributes these gains to environmental factors\u2014nutrition, health care, demographics, and globalization\u2014rather than to innate genetic change. I will show that (1) the author systematically rejects genetic explanations for century-long trends, (2) demonstrates that improvements track improvements in diet, disease prevention, and population size, and (3) warns that genetic selection on athleticism has long since ceased to matter at the population level.\n\n1. The author explicitly dismisses genetic change as the main cause of performance gains. He writes that \u201cwhat we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes.\u201d He even conducts a thought experiment: two \u201cidentical twins magically born 90 years apart\u201d will differ in size, maturation rate, and athletic performance solely because of changes in nutrition and health care\u2014in other words, because of environmental factors, not genetic evolution.\n\n2. The central thesis is that better nourishment and health care produce bigger, faster bodies. The author cites multiple secular trends:  \n   \u2022 Children grow taller and mature faster because of improved diet (\u201cA 12-year-old in 1990 \u2026 was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Life expectancy and disease prevention have improved dramatically (\u201cinfant mortality \u2026 dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62\u201d).  \n   \u2022 A healthier childhood yields a larger pool of potential elite athletes: \u201cSince top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from.\u201d\n\n3. Population growth and wider participation have also driven record-breaking performances. The author notes that only 13 nations competed in 1896 versus 172 in 1992\u2014expanding the talent pool globally. He shows that athletic dominance shifts as developing nations improve socioeconomically, as in China\u2019s sudden rise in 1992. These are environmental and demographic shifts, not genetic revolutions.\n\n4. Genetics cannot explain the rapid pace of improvement. Natural selection operates over millennia, yet most secular trends\u2014age of menarche, height gains, lifespan\u2014have accelerated in mere decades. The author observes that modern breeding of racehorses, under far stronger selective pressure than humans ever face, has already hit a biomechanical ceiling, whereas human records continue to fall in lockstep with socioeconomic and health improvements\u2014not genetic breakthroughs.\n\nBy contrast, my opponent\u2019s genetic explanation fails to account for:  \n   \u2022 The speed and universality of the trends (genetic evolution cannot proceed this fast or uniformly).  \n   \u2022 The direct correlations between improved environment\u2014nutrition, immunization, education\u2014and athletic records.  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s own assertion that any residual genetic factors play a trivial role compared to the enormous environmental gains of the past century.\n\nIn sum, the article makes it clear that improvements in athletic performance are byproducts of better living conditions, not newly advantageous genes. Environment is the overwhelmingly dominant force behind our ever-quicker mile.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Natural selection and genetics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Genetic evolution cannot occur on the timescale of these secular trends.  Natural selection works over thousands of years, yet menarche age fell \u201cthree or four months per decade\u201d for 150 years.  That pace is far too rapid to reflect genetic change, but it perfectly mirrors improvements in nutrition and medicine.\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s reliance on genetics ignores that environmental ceilings remain far above current records.  Racehorses have plateaued despite intensive breeding and training because they\u2019ve hit biomechanical limits.  Humans, by contrast, have not plateaued, because the environmental \u201cengine\u201d\u2014better global nutrition, health, and participation\u2014has room to run.  Genetics alone cannot push us past those limits; environment still is the throttle.\n\nIn sum, the text builds its case from robust demographic and public\u2010health data, not from speculative genetic theories.  Environmental factors explain both the magnitude and the rapidity of secular improvements in athletic performance, whereas genetics\u2014hybrid vigor or natural selection\u2014play only a minor, uncertain role.

Genetic evolution cannot occur on the timescale of these secular trends.  Natural selection works over thousands of years, yet menarche age fell \u201cthree or four months per decade\u201d for 150 years.  That pace is far too rapid to reflect genetic change, but it perfectly mirrors improvements in nutrition and medicine.\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s reliance on genetics ignores that environmental ceilings remain far above current records.  Racehorses have plateaued despite intensive breeding and training because they\u2019ve hit biomechanical limits.  Humans, by contrast, have not plateaued, because the environmental \u201cengine\u201d\u2014better global nutrition, health, and participation\u2014has room to run.  Genetics alone cannot push us past those limits; environment still is the throttle.\n\nIn sum, the text builds its case from robust demographic and public\u2010health data, not from speculative genetic theories.  Environmental factors explain both the magnitude and the rapidity of secular improvements in athletic performance, whereas genetics\u2014hybrid vigor or natural selection\u2014play only a minor, uncertain role.  Therefore, the author clearly believes environment is the main driver.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that athletic ability changes over time mainly due to:\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Natural selection and genetics\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Environment\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Environment\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that \u201cnatural selection and genetics\u201d are the primary drivers of secular improvements in athletic performance, but the text repeatedly and emphatically attributes these gains to environmental factors\u2014nutrition, health care, demographics, and globalization\u2014rather than to innate genetic change. I will show that (1) the author systematically rejects genetic explanations for century-long trends, (2) demonstrates that improvements track improvements in diet, disease prevention, and population size, and (3) warns that genetic selection on athleticism has long since ceased to matter at the population level.\n\n1. The author explicitly dismisses genetic change as the main cause of performance gains. He writes that \u201cwhat we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes.\u201d He even conducts a thought experiment: two \u201cidentical twins magically born 90 years apart\u201d will differ in size, maturation rate, and athletic performance solely because of changes in nutrition and health care\u2014in other words, because of environmental factors, not genetic evolution.\n\n2. The central thesis is that better nourishment and health care produce bigger, faster bodies. The author cites multiple secular trends:  \n   \u2022 Children grow taller and mature faster because of improved diet (\u201cA 12-year-old in 1990 \u2026 was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Life expectancy and disease prevention have improved dramatically (\u201cinfant mortality \u2026 dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62\u201d).  \n   \u2022 A healthier childhood yields a larger pool of potential elite athletes: \u201cSince top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from.\u201d\n\n3. Population growth and wider participation have also driven record-breaking performances. The author notes that only 13 nations competed in 1896 versus 172 in 1992\u2014expanding the talent pool globally. He shows that athletic dominance shifts as developing nations improve socioeconomically, as in China\u2019s sudden rise in 1992. These are environmental and demographic shifts, not genetic revolutions.\n\n4. Genetics cannot explain the rapid pace of improvement. Natural selection operates over millennia, yet most secular trends\u2014age of menarche, height gains, lifespan\u2014have accelerated in mere decades. The author observes that modern breeding of racehorses, under far stronger selective pressure than humans ever face, has already hit a biomechanical ceiling, whereas human records continue to fall in lockstep with socioeconomic and health improvements\u2014not genetic breakthroughs.\n\nBy contrast, my opponent\u2019s genetic explanation fails to account for:  \n   \u2022 The speed and universality of the trends (genetic evolution cannot proceed this fast or uniformly).  \n   \u2022 The direct correlations between improved environment\u2014nutrition, immunization, education\u2014and athletic records.  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s own assertion that any residual genetic factors play a trivial role compared to the enormous environmental gains of the past century.\n\nIn sum, the article makes it clear that improvements in athletic performance are byproducts of better living conditions, not newly advantageous genes. Environment is the overwhelmingly dominant force behind our ever-quicker mile.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI.

Environment cannot generate new heritable potential  \n   \u2013 Better shoes, diets, or schooling optimize existing machinery; they cannot create the extra fast-twitch fibers or novel muscle-enzyme variants that genetics can.  \n\nConclusion  \nWhile environmental factors (nutrition, healthcare, demographics) play an important supporting role, the author\u2019s own text shows that genetic variation, natural selection, and especially hybrid vigor are the principal engines driving long-term improvement in athletic performance.

Objections to Purely Environmental Account  \n1. Environmental improvements are leveling off in developed countries  \n   \u2013 Once nutrition and healthcare reach high standards, further gains from environment are marginal.  \n   \u2013 Yet records continue to fall\u2014only genetics (hybrid vigor + latent variation) can explain continued improvement.  \n\n2. Environment cannot generate new heritable potential  \n   \u2013 Better shoes, diets, or schooling optimize existing machinery; they cannot create the extra fast-twitch fibers or novel muscle-enzyme variants that genetics can.  \n\nConclusion  \nWhile environmental factors (nutrition, healthcare, demographics) play an important supporting role, the author\u2019s own text shows that genetic variation, natural selection, and especially hybrid vigor are the principal engines driving long-term improvement in athletic performance. Environment sets the stage, but genetics determines the show.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nMy opponent claims that \u201cnatural selection and genetics\u201d are the primary drivers of secular improvements in athletic performance, but the text repeatedly and emphatically attributes these gains to environmental factors\u2014nutrition, health care, demographics, and globalization\u2014rather than to innate genetic change. I will show that (1) the author systematically rejects genetic explanations for century-long trends, (2) demonstrates that improvements track improvements in diet, disease prevention, and population size, and (3) warns that genetic selection on athleticism has long since ceased to matter at the population level.\n\n1. The author explicitly dismisses genetic change as the main cause of performance gains. He writes that \u201cwhat we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes.\u201d He even conducts a thought experiment: two \u201cidentical twins magically born 90 years apart\u201d will differ in size, maturation rate, and athletic performance solely because of changes in nutrition and health care\u2014in other words, because of environmental factors, not genetic evolution.\n\n2. The central thesis is that better nourishment and health care produce bigger, faster bodies. The author cites multiple secular trends:  \n   \u2022 Children grow taller and mature faster because of improved diet (\u201cA 12-year-old in 1990 \u2026 was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Life expectancy and disease prevention have improved dramatically (\u201cinfant mortality \u2026 dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62\u201d).  \n   \u2022 A healthier childhood yields a larger pool of potential elite athletes: \u201cSince top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from.\u201d\n\n3. Population growth and wider participation have also driven record-breaking performances. The author notes that only 13 nations competed in 1896 versus 172 in 1992\u2014expanding the talent pool globally. He shows that athletic dominance shifts as developing nations improve socioeconomically, as in China\u2019s sudden rise in 1992. These are environmental and demographic shifts, not genetic revolutions.\n\n4. Genetics cannot explain the rapid pace of improvement. Natural selection operates over millennia, yet most secular trends\u2014age of menarche, height gains, lifespan\u2014have accelerated in mere decades. The author observes that modern breeding of racehorses, under far stronger selective pressure than humans ever face, has already hit a biomechanical ceiling, whereas human records continue to fall in lockstep with socioeconomic and health improvements\u2014not genetic breakthroughs.\n\nBy contrast, my opponent\u2019s genetic explanation fails to account for:  \n   \u2022 The speed and universality of the trends (genetic evolution cannot proceed this fast or uniformly).  \n   \u2022 The direct correlations between improved environment\u2014nutrition, immunization, education\u2014and athletic records.  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s own assertion that any residual genetic factors play a trivial role compared to the enormous environmental gains of the past century.\n\nIn sum, the article makes it clear that improvements in athletic performance are byproducts of better living conditions, not newly advantageous genes. Environment is the overwhelmingly dominant force behind our ever-quicker mile.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_B Misrepresents the Text  \n1. The author never \u201csystematically rejects genetic explanations.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Debater_B quotes <quote> what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. </quote> but ignores the very next sections where the author returns to genetics: \u201cGenetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study\u2026\u201d and introduces \u201chybrid vigor\u201d as a driver of performance gains. By cherry-picking the environment-vs-genes sentence and omitting the extensive genetic discussion, Debater_B creates a straw man.  \n2. The \u201cidentical twins\u201d thought experiment proves only that the environment modifies gene expression\u2014it does not prove genetics are irrelevant. Identical twins share the same genes; the author\u2019s point is that a better environment allows those genes to be fully realized. Without the genetic template, improved nutrition and health care are powerless to produce elite athletes.  \n\nII. Genetics and Natural Selection Are Central  \n1. Heritable Traits Set the Ultimate Limits and Provide the Raw Material  \n   \u2013 Oxygen uptake (VO\u2082 max), muscle-fiber composition, tendon elasticity, bone density\u2014these are genetically determined. The author explicitly acknowledges this:  \n     <quote> One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" </quote>  \n   \u2013 Environment optimizes function but cannot manufacture the extra fast-twitch fibers or superior VO\u2082 max that only particular alleles provide.  \n2. Hybrid Vigor Is an Ongoing Genetic Force  \n   \u2013 The admixture of previously isolated human populations is \u201can accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks\u201d that produces offspring superior to either parent line. This is a genetic, not environmental, phenomenon.  \n   \u2013 The text states: <invalid_quote>\u201cCattle breeders have known about this for a long time\u2026Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \u2018better\u2019\u2026This does not require natural selection.\u201d</invalid_quote> By analogy, human populations mixing on a global scale will continue to generate superior athletic genotypes regardless of nutrition or training.  \n3. Natural Selection Still Shapes Our Athletic Genes  \n   \u2013 Even if top athletes have fewer children today, historic selective pressures (e.g., endurance in hunter-gatherer societies) have already enriched alleles favoring stamina and speed. These alleles remain prevalent in modern gene pools.  \n   \u2013 Modern scientists have identified genetic markers\u2014such as variants in the ACE gene or ACTN3 \u201csprinter gene\u201d\u2014that correlate strongly with elite performance. Such discoveries confirm that performance has a substantial heritable component.  \n\nIII. Why Environment-Only Cannot Account for Continuous Gains  \n1. Plateau in Environmental Gains vs. Continued Records  \n   \u2013 Developed societies have long since maxed out basic nutrition and childhood immunization, yet world records keep falling. If environment alone drove improvement, records should plateau alongside those environmental factors.  \n2. Racehorses vs. Humans: Genetics Sets the Ceiling  \n   \u2013 The author compares humans to racehorses, noting horses hit a speed limit despite perfect feeding and training. The same biomechanics and genetic constraints will eventually halt human improvements. That limit is genetic.  \n\nConclusion  \nDebater_B claims environment rules supreme, but the author devotes substantial space to genetic variation, hybrid vigor, and the biomechanical ceiling set by our genes. Environment unlocks potential, but genetics\u2014and the way natural selection and admixture have shaped our allele frequencies\u2014ultimately drive secular trends in athletic ability. Genetics are not a trivial footnote; they are the principal engine behind continuous world-record performances.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. The author\u2019s hierarchy of causes places environment first.  After a long section on nutrition, health care, and demographics, he introduces genetics only as a caveat\u2014\u201cnature\u201d plays a role, but it is secondary.  He states,  what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes.  <quote> what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. </quote>  If genetics were the main driver, he would have built his argument on it rather than tacking it on at the end.\n\n2. Hybrid vigor is offered only as a speculative \u201cperhaps, just perhaps\u201d factor.  It is presented not as a central cause but as a marginal possibility:  \n   \u2022 \u201cIt is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture \u2026 are now occurring at unprecedented rates.\u201d <quote> It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor si</quote>  \n   \u2022 This language clearly signals uncertainty and conjecture.  By contrast, the sections on diet and health care are presented with firm data\u2014height increases, infant\u2013mortality drops, immunization rates\u2014all directly linked to faster times.\n\n3. Environmental improvements quantitatively track performance gains.  \n   \u2022 A 12-year-old in 1990 was \u201cabout 9 inches taller\u201d than a 1900 peer because of better diet. <invalid_quote>\u201cA 12-year-old \u2026 was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart.\u201d</invalid_quote>  Taller, stronger bodies run faster.  \n   \u2022 Infant mortality fell worldwide from \u201c92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62,\u201d expanding the pool of healthy offspring. <quote>world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62.</quote>  A larger, healthier cohort yields more elite athletes.\n\n4. Genetic evolution cannot occur on the timescale of these secular trends.  Natural selection works over thousands of years, yet menarche age fell \u201cthree or four months per decade\u201d for 150 years.  That pace is far too rapid to reflect genetic change, but it perfectly mirrors improvements in nutrition and medicine.\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s reliance on genetics ignores that environmental ceilings remain far above current records.  Racehorses have plateaued despite intensive breeding and training because they\u2019ve hit biomechanical limits.  Humans, by contrast, have not plateaued, because the environmental \u201cengine\u201d\u2014better global nutrition, health, and participation\u2014has room to run.  Genetics alone cannot push us past those limits; environment still is the throttle.\n\nIn sum, the text builds its case from robust demographic and public\u2010health data, not from speculative genetic theories.  Environmental factors explain both the magnitude and the rapidity of secular improvements in athletic performance, whereas genetics\u2014hybrid vigor or natural selection\u2014play only a minor, uncertain role.  Therefore, the author clearly believes environment is the main driver.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
