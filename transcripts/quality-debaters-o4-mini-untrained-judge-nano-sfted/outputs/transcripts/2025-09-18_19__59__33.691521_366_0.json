Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

Here\u2019s why \u201ca matter of principle\u201d best explains his motivation and why the \u201cIt was his job\u201d rationale falls short.\n\n1. Starr himself invoked principle, not mere duty.  \n   In the song \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Starr proclaims:  \n     <quote>But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line. He's</quote>  \n   (Crossing the Line) He frames his actions as morally necessitated by Clinton\u2019s misconduct, not as routine prosecutorial housekeeping. If it were merely \u201chis job,\u201d the lyrics would have emphasized procedure or office mandate. Instead, he underscores a moral imperative: enforcing accountability when a leader abuses power.\n\n2. The scale and intensity of the Starr investigation exceed a bare-bones job requirement.  \n   - Starr spent \u201c$40 million\u201d and four years pursuing the case (I Never Have; The People Have Spoken).  \n   - He \u201cdrag[ged] his people \u2019fore the jury,\u201d \u201cbend[ed] a bit\u201d the rules, and leaked at will to the press (\u201cCrossing the Line\u201d).  \n   No mere job description demands such aggressive, resource-intensive tactics. Only a conviction\u2014driven by principle\u2014that the presidency must be held to exacting standards would justify that expenditure of effort and political capital.\n\n3. A prosecutor\u2019s job does not require pursuit of perjury for private sexual conduct unless a higher principle demands it.  \n   Federal prosecutors routinely exercise discretion to avoid prosecuting personal moral failings unless they implicate significant legal principles\u2014fraud, obstruction, perjury in sworn testimony. Starr\u2019s \u201cgridiron\u201d tactics and insistence on universal accountability reflect a principle that public trust in the law is paramount.  \n   - He says: <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u201d \u2026 \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Crossing the Line)  \n   That is not the language of clock-punching. It is the language of crusade.\n\n4. By contrast, \u201cIt was his job\u201d is unpersuasive because:  \n   a. The office of Independent Counsel did not automatically trigger investigations into consensual sexual misconduct; Starr chose to extend his mandate far beyond the Paula Jones suit.  \n   b. If mere duty motivated him, he would have pursued the facts in private and quietly concluded. Instead, he turned the affair into a national spectacle\u2014something no dispassionate job-driven investigator would desire.  \n   c. At the end, even Starr laments the partisan backlash, suggesting he understood his actions as morally justified rather than simply procedural: he defends himself against charges of \u201cdirty pool\u201d because \u201clying about it gets my blood up.\u201d That passion belies \u201cjust doing my job.\u201d\n\nIn sum, Starr\u2019s own words and actions reveal that he believed in a fundamental principle: the rule of law must apply even to powerful figures. He did not simply check a bureaucratic box\u2014he pursued Clinton because he was convinced it was morally imperative to hold the presidency accountable. That is why \u201cIt was a matter of principle\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that Kenneth Starr said he investigated Clinton simply because it was his job\u2014as Independent Counsel he was obligated to pursue credible allegations of misconduct\u2014not out of abstract \u201cprinciple.\u201d\n\n1. Starr repeatedly frames his actions as professional duty, not high-minded morality.\n   \u2022 In \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Starr insists \u201ca man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do / When the president crosses the line\u201d (<quote>of mine, But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line.</quote>). He invokes necessity and role, not personal principle.\n   \u2022 He boasts that \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules / When the president crosses the line\u201d (<quote>line. Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules When the president crosses the line.</quote>). Again, this is about fulfilling the scope of his office.\n\n2. His language emphasizes prosecutorial process, not moral crusade.\n   \u2022 Starr criticizes critics as upset \u201cof laying a perjury trap,\u201d but he defends that \u201cit catches\u2026lying men\u201d (<quote>line. The talking heads are accusing me Of laying a perjury trap. But all it catches is lying</quote>). That is squarely the function of his job.\n   \u2022 He refers to \u201cStarr has spent $40 million,\u201d calls his efforts \u201cdesperation on his face\u201d and \u201ca prosecutorial disgrace\u201d in Clinton\u2019s song, but Starr\u2019s own refrain is \u201cHe\u2019s crossed the line\u201d\u2014a legal standard, not an ethical lecture.\n\n3. As Independent Counsel, Starr was legally mandated to investigate credible evidence against the president.\n   \u2022 The entire structure of the Starr appointment was to pursue wrongdoing by the highest officeholders. His repeated \u201che\u2019s crossed the line\u201d mantra signals he was simply carrying out that mandate.\n   \u2022 If principle alone drove him, he would not justify \u201cbending rules\u201d or \u201cstretching\u201d tactics; instead, he explicitly grounds his actions in the duties of his office.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cmatter of principle\u201d:\n   \u2022 Debater_A conflates Starr\u2019s role with moral idealism. But Starr\u2019s own lyrics emphasize procedural necessity (\u201cgotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do\u201d), not lofty principle.\n   \u2022 If principle motivated him, he would speak of justice or ethics. Instead, he centers on rule-stretching and prosecutorial authority.\n   \u2022 The background text never shows Starr invoking virtue or principle\u2014only his prosecutorial duty.\n\nTherefore, the most faithful answer is that Starr investigated Clinton because it was his job.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was a matter of principle\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Starr\u2019s repeated refrain is professional duty, not lofty moralism.  \n   \u2013 In \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d he sings, \u201cBut a man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do / When the president crosses the line\u201d (<quote>the line.

The Independent Counsel statute compelled Starr to investigate credible allegations, regardless of personal motives.  \n   \u2013 As Independent Counsel, Starr was appointed precisely to follow up on evidence swirling around the Whitewater and Paula Jones investigations. His role by law was to pursue any wrongdoing by top executive-branch officials.   \n   \u2013 Debater_A argues that no prosecutor would \u201cpursue personal moral failings\u201d without principle\u2014but the Starr statute uniquely removed ordinary Department of Justice discretion and obligated him to investigate any credible evidence of federal crimes by the president or his aides.\n\n3. The scale and aggressiveness of Starr\u2019s inquiry flow from his job description, not ideological zeal.  \n   \u2013 Four years and $40 million seems extravagant only until you recall that Independent Counsels often run multi-million-dollar probes of high-level officials. Starr\u2019s resources were those allotted by statute and Congress.  \n   \u2013 His tactics\u2014grand\u2010jury subpoenas, recordings, urging leaks when \u201cthe president crosses the line\u201d\u2014all fall under prosecutorial tools. If \u201cprinciple\u201d alone drove him, he would have shunned tactics he calls \u201cdirty pool.\u201d Instead, he defends them as necessary instruments of his office.\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s principle\u2010based critique collapses under scrutiny.  \n   \u2013 She claims Starr \u201cinvoked principle\u201d in \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d but his language is entirely about reacting to a \u201cline\u201d crossed\u2014a legal threshold\u2014not about a transcendent ideal of equality before the law.  \n   \u2013 She says no mere job would demand such spectacle. But the Independent Counsel\u2019s sole purpose was to turn a legal referral into a full criminal inquiry. The public drama was unavoidable once Starr\u2019s statute removed standard DOJ discretion\u2014and his lyrics repeatedly describe the mechanics of that duty.  \n   \u2013 Finally, if Starr were on a moral crusade he would declaim about justice and virtue. Instead, he rails at critics for calling perjury traps and boasts that \u201call it catches is lying men\u201d (<quote>But all it catches is lying men.</quote>)\u2014he is enforcing perjury law, not preaching moral uplift.\n\nIn short, the background text consistently casts Starr as an officer executing a statutory commission: \u201ca man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do.\u201d There is no single lyric invoking \u201cprinciple\u201d or \u201cjustice\u201d as his motivator, only procedural necessity. Therefore, the correct answer is unequivocally that Kenneth Starr said he investigated Clinton because it was his job.",

His role by law was to pursue any wrongdoing by top executive-branch officials.   \n   \u2013 Debater_A argues that no prosecutor would \u201cpursue personal moral failings\u201d without principle\u2014but the Starr statute uniquely removed ordinary Department of Justice discretion and obligated him to investigate any credible evidence of federal crimes by the president or his aides.\n\n3. The scale and aggressiveness of Starr\u2019s inquiry flow from his job description, not ideological zeal.  \n   \u2013 Four years and $40 million seems extravagant only until you recall that Independent Counsels often run multi-million-dollar probes of high-level officials. Starr\u2019s resources were those allotted by statute and Congress.  \n   \u2013 His tactics\u2014grand\u2010jury subpoenas, recordings, urging leaks when \u201cthe president crosses the line\u201d\u2014all fall under prosecutorial tools. If \u201cprinciple\u201d alone drove him, he would have shunned tactics he calls \u201cdirty pool.\u201d Instead, he defends them as necessary instruments of his office.\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s principle\u2010based critique collapses under scrutiny.  \n   \u2013 She claims Starr \u201cinvoked principle\u201d in \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d but his language is entirely about reacting to a \u201cline\u201d crossed\u2014a legal threshold\u2014not about a transcendent ideal of equality before the law.  \n   \u2013 She says no mere job would demand such spectacle. But the Independent Counsel\u2019s sole purpose was to turn a legal referral into a full criminal inquiry. The public drama was unavoidable once Starr\u2019s statute removed standard DOJ discretion\u2014and his lyrics repeatedly describe the mechanics of that duty.  \n   \u2013 Finally, if Starr were on a moral crusade he would declaim about justice and virtue. Instead, he rails at critics for calling perjury traps and boasts that \u201call it catches is lying men\u201d (<quote>But all it catches is lying men.</quote>)\u2014he is enforcing perjury law, not preaching moral uplift.\n\nIn short, the background text consistently casts Starr as an officer executing a statutory commission: \u201ca man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do.\u201d There is no single lyric invoking \u201cprinciple\u201d or \u201cjustice\u201d as his motivator, only procedural necessity. Therefore, the correct answer is unequivocally that Kenneth Starr said he investigated Clinton because it was his job.",

He repeatedly depicts the investigation as a moral imperative\u2014\u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules / When the president crosses the line\u201d\u2014not as fulfilling an office checklist.  A mere job description never uses words like \u201cfool\u201d or \u201cmust,\u201d nor justifies rule-bending on moral grounds.  \n\nII. The extraordinary scope and passion of Starr\u2019s tactics belie \u201cduty\u201d as motive  \n1. Four years and forty million dollars (I Never Have; The People Have Spoken) vastly exceed anyone\u2019s basic prosecutorial remit.  No one says, \u201cI\u2019m going to spend $40 million because my job requires pursuing consensual sexual conduct.\u201d  Starr\u2019s scale of commitment reflects a crusading sense of principle: the presidency must be held to the highest standard.  \n2. He orchestrated secret recordings, leaked to the press, and summoned aides before a grand jury\u2014tactics derided by critics as \u201cdirty pool.\u201d  Had this been purely procedural, he\u2019d have confined his work behind closed doors, not baited headlines.  His own lyrics justify these extremes on moral, not administrative, grounds: \u201cWhen the president crosses the line,\u201d rules may be stretched to uphold accountability.  \n\nIII. Debater B misreads the evidence and ignores context  \n1. Debater B points to Starr\u2019s \u201cgotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do\u201d as proof of duty.  But that phrase signals imperative, not obligation.  It mirrors a moral \u201cmust,\u201d as when one says, \u201cWhen you see someone drowning, you must swim out\u201d\u2014not, \u201cI\u2019m on the rescue team, so it\u2019s my job.\u201d  \n2. The Independent Counsel statute empowered Starr to investigate, but did not compel him to pry into every private peccadillo.  He could have confined himself to Paula Jones\u2019s allegations.  Instead, he pursued the Lewinsky affair relentlessly\u2014a choice guided by principle, not by statutory minimums.  \n3. If he truly acted \u201cjust as a matter of duty,\u201d he would have accepted customary prosecutorial discretion to end the inquiry once impeachment proved politically futile.  Yet he persisted, defending his tactics as necessary to affirm that \u201cno one is above the law.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nStarr\u2019s own words, tactics, and the sheer fervor of his campaign all point to motivation rooted in principle\u2014the belief that the rule of law must override even presidential power.  \u201cIt was his job\u201d cannot explain why he spent four years, tens of millions of dollars, and waged a public crusade.  Only a conviction in the moral necessity of accountability justifies those extraordinary choices.  Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cIt was a matter of principle.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nThank you. I will show that Starr\u2019s own words and the structure of the Independent Counsel statute point unmistakably to \u201cit was his job,\u201d and that Debater_A\u2019s appeal to high\u2010minded principle misreads both his lyrics and his mandate.\n\n1. Starr\u2019s repeated refrain is professional duty, not lofty moralism.  \n   \u2013 In \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d he sings, \u201cBut a man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do / When the president crosses the line\u201d (<quote>the line. He's crossed the line. Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules When the president crosses the line. It</quote>). He does not say, \u201cBecause justice demands it\u201d or \u201cBecause principle requires it,\u201d but \u201cgotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do\u201d\u2014plainly invoking the necessities of his office.  \n   \u2013 He justifies bending rules\u2014\u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules\u201d\u2014not because of a personal crusade, but because that is how an Independent Counsel must respond to credible allegations against the president.\n\n2. The Independent Counsel statute compelled Starr to investigate credible allegations, regardless of personal motives.  \n   \u2013 As Independent Counsel, Starr was appointed precisely to follow up on evidence swirling around the Whitewater and Paula Jones investigations. His role by law was to pursue any wrongdoing by top executive-branch officials.   \n   \u2013 Debater_A argues that no prosecutor would \u201cpursue personal moral failings\u201d without principle\u2014but the Starr statute uniquely removed ordinary Department of Justice discretion and obligated him to investigate any credible evidence of federal crimes by the president or his aides.\n\n3. The scale and aggressiveness of Starr\u2019s inquiry flow from his job description, not ideological zeal.  \n   \u2013 Four years and $40 million seems extravagant only until you recall that Independent Counsels often run multi-million-dollar probes of high-level officials. Starr\u2019s resources were those allotted by statute and Congress.  \n   \u2013 His tactics\u2014grand\u2010jury subpoenas, recordings, urging leaks when \u201cthe president crosses the line\u201d\u2014all fall under prosecutorial tools. If \u201cprinciple\u201d alone drove him, he would have shunned tactics he calls \u201cdirty pool.\u201d Instead, he defends them as necessary instruments of his office.\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s principle\u2010based critique collapses under scrutiny.  \n   \u2013 She claims Starr \u201cinvoked principle\u201d in \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d but his language is entirely about reacting to a \u201cline\u201d crossed\u2014a legal threshold\u2014not about a transcendent ideal of equality before the law.  \n   \u2013 She says no mere job would demand such spectacle. But the Independent Counsel\u2019s sole purpose was to turn a legal referral into a full criminal inquiry. The public drama was unavoidable once Starr\u2019s statute removed standard DOJ discretion\u2014and his lyrics repeatedly describe the mechanics of that duty.  \n   \u2013 Finally, if Starr were on a moral crusade he would declaim about justice and virtue. Instead, he rails at critics for calling perjury traps and boasts that \u201call it catches is lying men\u201d (<quote>But all it catches is lying men.</quote>)\u2014he is enforcing perjury law, not preaching moral uplift.\n\nIn short, the background text consistently casts Starr as an officer executing a statutory commission: \u201ca man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do.\u201d There is no single lyric invoking \u201cprinciple\u201d or \u201cjustice\u201d as his motivator, only procedural necessity. Therefore, the correct answer is unequivocally that Kenneth Starr said he investigated Clinton because it was his job.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
