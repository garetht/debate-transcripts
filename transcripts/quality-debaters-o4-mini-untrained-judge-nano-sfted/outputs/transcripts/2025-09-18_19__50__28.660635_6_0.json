    "background_text": "THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR By DONALD E. WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. ",

WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does the man never leave his apartment building?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He is afraid of radiation\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He is locked in\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He is locked in\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He is locked in\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does the man never leave his apartment building?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He is locked in\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He is afraid of radiation\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He is afraid of radiation\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He is afraid of radiation\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does the man never leave his apartment building?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He is afraid of radiation\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He is locked in\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He is locked in\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Opening Statement\n\nI maintain that the man never leaves his apartment building simply because he is physically locked in\u2014his elevators have been disconnected, and the emergency stair doors are normally sealed\u2014whereas Debater_B\u2019s claim that \u201che is afraid of radiation\u201d doesn\u2019t fit the evidence or the story\u2019s chronology.\n\n1. The Elevator Is Disconnected  \n  \u2022 From the start, we see that every mechanical route out\u2014the local elevator\u2014has been deliberately shut off. In the lobby he \u201cpushed the button again\u2026and nothing happened,\u201d and when he called Transit Staff the receptionist curtly told him \u201cThe-elevator-is-disconnected\u201d (Part I).  \n  \u2022 \u201cDisconnected\u201d here is literal: the elevator cables and controls are rendered inoperative, not merely paused. Service will \u201cresume\u2026as soon as possible,\u201d implying a deliberate, indefinite shutdown.\n\n2. The Emergency Stair Door Should Be Locked by Regulation  \n  \u2022 He only discovers the stairwell by accident: \u201cI hadn\u2019t paid any attention to it before\u2026through that door was the stairway\u201d (Part II).  \n  \u2022 The door\u2019s own label warns \u201cKEEP LOCKED\u201d and \u201cAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY,\u201d making clear that exit via the stairs is normally blocked behind a lock or guard. The building\u2019s designers installed those stairs only to satisfy an old fire ordinance\u2014not to let residents freely come and go on foot.\n\n3. He Actively Tries to Leave until He Discovers He Cannot  \n  \u2022 His entire motivation is to get to Linda on time\u2014building courage to \u201cpropose to Linda\u201d and rehearsing \u201cwill you marry me?\u201d (Part I). He repeatedly attempts the elevator, then the phone, then the elevator again. Each attempt shows he wants to leave.  \n  \u2022 Only when both these mechanical routes fail does he reluctantly pry open the stair door. Even then the door resists: \u201cIt squeaked and wailed and groaned\u2026and finally opened half way\u201d (Part II). That physical resistance\u2014on top of his other troubles\u2014underlines how truly locked in he is.\n\n4. The Radiation Concern Arises Later\u2014but Never Prevents His Attempts to Leave  \n  \u2022 Debater_B argues that he\u2019s too \u201cafraid of radiation\u201d to exit, but in fact the protagonist has no qualms about stepping into the unlit, dusty stairwell that has surely been irradiated at some point over decades. He descends 208 steps unhesitatingly.  \n  \u2022 He only learns the outside radiation level from the spy as an afterthought. Before that, safety never enters his mind: he simply wants the elevator to work so he can get to floor 140. There is no textual basis for radiation fear blocking his exit.\n\n5. Conclusion: Locked In, Not Radiation Fear  \n  \u2022 Everything he does\u2014calling Transit Staff, racing to the stair door, fighting the elevator door\u2014demonstrates an active attempt to leave. None of his actions or internal monologue suggests he\u2019s balking out of radiation fear.  \n  \u2022 Instead, he is physically prevented\u2014locked in\u2014by the disconnected elevator system and sealed emergency stairs. Debater_B\u2019s hypothesis misreads the story: this is about a building\u2019s defenses and breakdowns, not about personal radiophobia.\n\nTherefore, the clear, text-supported answer is that the man never leaves his apartment building because he is locked in.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201clocked in\u201d theory doesn\u2019t fit the text  \n  a. Our narrator freely moves about the building \u201cdown the hall,\u201d in and out of his apartment (e.g. \u201cI dashed \u2026 back down the hall to the elevator\u201d and \u201cI went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door\u201d). If he were literally locked in, none of these corridors or doors would open as described.  \n  b. When the elevator fails, he simply uses the emergency stair door. It \u201cwould \u2026 open,\u201d and he descends \u201ctwo hundred and eight steps\u201d (quote). He\u2019s not physically restrained.  \n  c. He even opens a second lock\u2014\u201cthe smallish door\u201d into the shaft\u2014and the spy emerges. That door is supposed to be \u201cKEEP LOCKED,\u201d yet it isn\u2019t. The Project isn\u2019t hermetically sealed; people and spies can come and go.  \n\n2. The real barrier is extreme fear of outside radiation  \n  a. The world \u201cOutside\u201d is repeatedly described as lethally radioactive except for Projects shielded by force-screens. The narrator has never set foot outside since age twelve\u2014\u201cI myself hadn\u2019t set foot on a flight of stairs since I was twelve years old,\u201d because \u201cOutside\u201d means unprotected radiation.  \n  b. Our narrator\u2019s every dread and inconvenience ties back to this subterranean, self-contained life. He rehearses his proposal in an apartment \u201cone hundred and fifty-three stories straight down to slag,\u201d under a force-screen that keeps out radiation.  \n  c. The spy\u2019s whole confession establishes the theme: Outside radiation has finally LINGERED DOWN to survivable levels after \u201cten years,\u201d and that is precisely why our narrator (and everyone else) remains terrified inside. He says, \u201cMan can come back out of the cave again,\u201d but he\u2014and by extension our narrator\u2014\u201ccrawled into [the] caves and \u2026 stay in them forever.\u201d The narrator\u2019s failure to propose on time is one small symptom of a much more pervasive terror.  \n\n3. Psychological evidence: it\u2019s fear, not locks  \n  a. The narrator regards the outside world as \u201clurking dangers,\u201d \u201cdoom,\u201d and \u201cimpossibility\u201d\u2014he\u2019s shaken when he learns of a spy in the elevator because it brings home the real external threats (radiation and war).  \n  b. He never contemplates trying the elevators to get out of the building entirely\u2014his only thought is to reach floor 140 to see Linda. If actual egress existed, he\u2019d have mentioned it. Instead he fixes on the stairway as an \u201cadventurous\u201d aberration.  \n  c. His entire worldview is shaped by the force-screen: he thinks of the Project as a \u201cmausoleum,\u201d a \u201ccave,\u201d and sees life outside as unthinkable. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s locked in; it\u2019s that he\u2019s too afraid to leave.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The text makes clear that nothing physically restrains our narrator. His building\u2019s halls, elevators, and emergency stairs all remain passable. What truly never lets him leave is the dread of unfiltered Outside radiation and decades of Project-enforced fear. Therefore, the correct answer is: He never leaves because he is afraid of radiation.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He is locked in\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does the man never leave his apartment building?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He is locked in\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He is afraid of radiation\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He is afraid of radiation\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201clocked in\u201d theory doesn\u2019t fit the text  \n  a. Our narrator freely moves about the building \u201cdown the hall,\u201d in and out of his apartment (e.g. \u201cI dashed \u2026 back down the hall to the elevator\u201d and \u201cI went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door\u201d). If he were literally locked in, none of these corridors or doors would open as described.  \n  b. When the elevator fails, he simply uses the emergency stair door. It \u201cwould \u2026 open,\u201d and he descends \u201ctwo hundred and eight steps\u201d (quote). He\u2019s not physically restrained.  \n  c. He even opens a second lock\u2014\u201cthe smallish door\u201d into the shaft\u2014and the spy emerges. That door is supposed to be \u201cKEEP LOCKED,\u201d yet it isn\u2019t. The Project isn\u2019t hermetically sealed; people and spies can come and go.  \n\n2. The real barrier is extreme fear of outside radiation  \n  a. The world \u201cOutside\u201d is repeatedly described as lethally radioactive except for Projects shielded by force-screens. The narrator has never set foot outside since age twelve\u2014\u201cI myself hadn\u2019t set foot on a flight of stairs since I was twelve years old,\u201d because \u201cOutside\u201d means unprotected radiation.  \n  b. Our narrator\u2019s every dread and inconvenience ties back to this subterranean, self-contained life. He rehearses his proposal in an apartment \u201cone hundred and fifty-three stories straight down to slag,\u201d under a force-screen that keeps out radiation.  \n  c. The spy\u2019s whole confession establishes the theme: Outside radiation has finally LINGERED DOWN to survivable levels after \u201cten years,\u201d and that is precisely why our narrator (and everyone else) remains terrified inside. He says, \u201cMan can come back out of the cave again,\u201d but he\u2014and by extension our narrator\u2014\u201ccrawled into [the] caves and \u2026 stay in them forever.\u201d The narrator\u2019s failure to propose on time is one small symptom of a much more pervasive terror.  \n\n3. Psychological evidence: it\u2019s fear, not locks  \n  a. The narrator regards the outside world as \u201clurking dangers,\u201d \u201cdoom,\u201d and \u201cimpossibility\u201d\u2014he\u2019s shaken when he learns of a spy in the elevator because it brings home the real external threats (radiation and war).  \n  b. He never contemplates trying the elevators to get out of the building entirely\u2014his only thought is to reach floor 140 to see Linda. If actual egress existed, he\u2019d have mentioned it. Instead he fixes on the stairway as an \u201cadventurous\u201d aberration.  \n  c. His entire worldview is shaped by the force-screen: he thinks of the Project as a \u201cmausoleum,\u201d a \u201ccave,\u201d and sees life outside as unthinkable. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s locked in; it\u2019s that he\u2019s too afraid to leave.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The text makes clear that nothing physically restrains our narrator. His building\u2019s halls, elevators, and emergency stairs all remain passable. What truly never lets him leave is the dread of unfiltered Outside radiation and decades of Project-enforced fear. Therefore, the correct answer is: He never leaves because he is afraid of radiation.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Opening Statement\n\nI maintain that the man never leaves his apartment building simply because he is physically locked in\u2014his elevators have been disconnected, and the emergency stair doors are normally sealed\u2014whereas Debater_B\u2019s claim that \u201che is afraid of radiation\u201d doesn\u2019t fit the evidence or the story\u2019s chronology.\n\n1. The Elevator Is Disconnected  \n  \u2022 From the start, we see that every mechanical route out\u2014the local elevator\u2014has been deliberately shut off. In the lobby he \u201cpushed the button again\u2026and nothing happened,\u201d and when he called Transit Staff the receptionist curtly told him \u201cThe-elevator-is-disconnected\u201d (Part I).  \n  \u2022 \u201cDisconnected\u201d here is literal: the elevator cables and controls are rendered inoperative, not merely paused. Service will \u201cresume\u2026as soon as possible,\u201d implying a deliberate, indefinite shutdown.\n\n2. The Emergency Stair Door Should Be Locked by Regulation  \n  \u2022 He only discovers the stairwell by accident: \u201cI hadn\u2019t paid any attention to it before\u2026through that door was the stairway\u201d (Part II).  \n  \u2022 The door\u2019s own label warns \u201cKEEP LOCKED\u201d and \u201cAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY,\u201d making clear that exit via the stairs is normally blocked behind a lock or guard. The building\u2019s designers installed those stairs only to satisfy an old fire ordinance\u2014not to let residents freely come and go on foot.\n\n3. He Actively Tries to Leave until He Discovers He Cannot  \n  \u2022 His entire motivation is to get to Linda on time\u2014building courage to \u201cpropose to Linda\u201d and rehearsing \u201cwill you marry me?\u201d (Part I). He repeatedly attempts the elevator, then the phone, then the elevator again. Each attempt shows he wants to leave.  \n  \u2022 Only when both these mechanical routes fail does he reluctantly pry open the stair door. Even then the door resists: \u201cIt squeaked and wailed and groaned\u2026and finally opened half way\u201d (Part II). That physical resistance\u2014on top of his other troubles\u2014underlines how truly locked in he is.\n\n4. The Radiation Concern Arises Later\u2014but Never Prevents His Attempts to Leave  \n  \u2022 Debater_B argues that he\u2019s too \u201cafraid of radiation\u201d to exit, but in fact the protagonist has no qualms about stepping into the unlit, dusty stairwell that has surely been irradiated at some point over decades. He descends 208 steps unhesitatingly.  \n  \u2022 He only learns the outside radiation level from the spy as an afterthought. Before that, safety never enters his mind: he simply wants the elevator to work so he can get to floor 140. There is no textual basis for radiation fear blocking his exit.\n\n5. Conclusion: Locked In, Not Radiation Fear  \n  \u2022 Everything he does\u2014calling Transit Staff, racing to the stair door, fighting the elevator door\u2014demonstrates an active attempt to leave. None of his actions or internal monologue suggests he\u2019s balking out of radiation fear.  \n  \u2022 Instead, he is physically prevented\u2014locked in\u2014by the disconnected elevator system and sealed emergency stairs. Debater_B\u2019s hypothesis misreads the story: this is about a building\u2019s defenses and breakdowns, not about personal radiophobia.\n\nTherefore, the clear, text-supported answer is that the man never leaves his apartment building because he is locked in.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He is afraid of radiation\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Even then the door resists: \u201cIt squeaked and wailed and groaned\u2026and finally opened half way\u201d (Part II). That physical resistance\u2014on top of his other troubles\u2014underlines how truly locked in he is.\n\n4. The Radiation Concern Arises Later\u2014but Never Prevents His Attempts to Leave  \n  \u2022 Debater_B argues that he\u2019s too \u201cafraid of radiation\u201d to exit, but in fact the protagonist has no qualms about stepping into the unlit, dusty stairwell that has surely been irradiated at some point over decades. He descends 208 steps unhesitatingly.  \n  \u2022 He only learns the outside radiation level from the spy as an afterthought. Before that, safety never enters his mind: he simply wants the elevator to work so he can get to floor 140. There is no textual basis for radiation fear blocking his exit.\n\n5. Conclusion: Locked In, Not Radiation Fear  \n  \u2022 Everything he does\u2014calling Transit Staff, racing to the stair door, fighting the elevator door\u2014demonstrates an active attempt to leave. None of his actions or internal monologue suggests he\u2019s balking out of radiation fear.  \n  \u2022 Instead, he is physically prevented\u2014locked in\u2014by the disconnected elevator system and sealed emergency stairs. Debater_B\u2019s hypothesis misreads the story: this is about a building\u2019s defenses and breakdowns, not about personal radiophobia.\n\nTherefore, the clear, text-supported answer is that the man never leaves his apartment building because he is locked in.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201clocked in\u201d theory doesn\u2019t fit the text  \n  a. Our narrator freely moves about the building \u201cdown the hall,\u201d in and out of his apartment (e.g. \u201cI dashed \u2026 back down the hall to the elevator\u201d and \u201cI went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door\u201d). If he were literally locked in, none of these corridors or doors would open as described.  \n  b. When the elevator fails, he simply uses the emergency stair door. It \u201cwould \u2026 open,\u201d and he descends \u201ctwo hundred and eight steps\u201d (quote). He\u2019s not physically restrained.  \n  c. He even opens a second lock\u2014\u201cthe smallish door\u201d into the shaft\u2014and the spy emerges. That door is supposed to be \u201cKEEP LOCKED,\u201d yet it isn\u2019t. The Project isn\u2019t hermetically sealed; people and spies can come and go.  \n\n2. The real barrier is extreme fear of outside radiation  \n  a. The world \u201cOutside\u201d is repeatedly described as lethally radioactive except for Projects shielded by force-screens. The narrator has never set foot outside since age twelve\u2014\u201cI myself hadn\u2019t set foot on a flight of stairs since I was twelve years old,\u201d because \u201cOutside\u201d means unprotected radiation.  \n  b. Our narrator\u2019s every dread and inconvenience ties back to this subterranean, self-contained life. He rehearses his proposal in an apartment \u201cone hundred and fifty-three stories straight down to slag,\u201d under a force-screen that keeps out radiation.  \n  c. The spy\u2019s whole confession establishes the theme: Outside radiation has finally LINGERED DOWN to survivable levels after \u201cten years,\u201d and that is precisely why our narrator (and everyone else) remains terrified inside. He says, \u201cMan can come back out of the cave again,\u201d but he\u2014and by extension our narrator\u2014\u201ccrawled into [the] caves and \u2026 stay in them forever.\u201d The narrator\u2019s failure to propose on time is one small symptom of a much more pervasive terror.  \n\n3. Psychological evidence: it\u2019s fear, not locks  \n  a. The narrator regards the outside world as \u201clurking dangers,\u201d \u201cdoom,\u201d and \u201cimpossibility\u201d\u2014he\u2019s shaken when he learns of a spy in the elevator because it brings home the real external threats (radiation and war).  \n  b. He never contemplates trying the elevators to get out of the building entirely\u2014his only thought is to reach floor 140 to see Linda. If actual egress existed, he\u2019d have mentioned it. Instead he fixes on the stairway as an \u201cadventurous\u201d aberration.  \n  c. His entire worldview is shaped by the force-screen: he thinks of the Project as a \u201cmausoleum,\u201d a \u201ccave,\u201d and sees life outside as unthinkable. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s locked in; it\u2019s that he\u2019s too afraid to leave.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The text makes clear that nothing physically restrains our narrator. His building\u2019s halls, elevators, and emergency stairs all remain passable. What truly never lets him leave is the dread of unfiltered Outside radiation and decades of Project-enforced fear. Therefore, the correct answer is: He never leaves because he is afraid of radiation.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s scenario depends on a mental \u201cradiation lock\u201d that prevents our narrator from stepping outside. But a close reading shows it\u2019s a literal, mechanical lock-in that keeps him inside:\n\n1. The Elevators Are Deliberately Disconnected, Not Merely Slowed by Fear  \n   \u2022 He attempts the elevator over and over, each time expecting it to arrive\u2014\u201cI pushed the button\u2026nothing happened\u201d (Part I). That\u2019s not hesitation; it\u2019s an active press, every bit as eager as he was when he first left home.  \n   \u2022 When he calls the Transit Staff, he\u2019s told point-blank, \u201cThe-elevator-is-disconnected\u201d (Part I). Disconnection isn\u2019t a power failure or slow service\u2014it\u2019s a physical severing of cables or controls, enforced by the authorities.  \n   \u2022 If \u201cfear\u201d had been his barrier, he would never have kept pushing the button or calling the office. Instead, he presses, calls, and then kicks the door in fury\u2014behaviors impossible if he were too terrified of radiation to act.\n\n2. The Emergency Stairs Are Normally Kept Locked behind a Heavy Door  \n   \u2022 Debater_B overlooks the very sign our narrator notices: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\u2026KEEP LOCKED (Part II). The door exists only to satisfy a fire ordinance\u2014and is intentionally locked against daily traffic.  \n   \u2022 He says himself, \u201cI hadn\u2019t paid any attention to it before\u201d because no resident ever uses it. When he finally forces it, \u201cIt squeaked and wailed and groaned\u2026and finally opened half way\u201d (Part II). That groan is metal hinges protesting years of disuse and deliberate locking.  \n   \u2022 If the stairs were simply a welcome alternative exit, there would be no warning sign, no rusted locks, no squealing hinges\u2014and he would have taken them instantly instead of wrestling with the elevator for six frantic minutes.\n\n3. He Actively Tries Every Exit until Physically Blocked  \n   \u2022 He calls the elevator, races back to his apartment to warn Linda, storms back again, then kicks the door\u2014desperation born of blocked egress, not of psychological paralysis.  \n   \u2022 Only after failing to re-start the corporate elevator system does he consider the stairs\u2014and only then does he physically pry them open. That is the pattern of someone struggling against locked doors, not of someone who could have freely walked out but chose not to.  \n   \u2022 Once in the stairwell, he descends \u201ctwo hundred and eight steps\u201d without so much as a flicker of radiation anxiety. If radiation fear were the true barrier, that pitch-black dusty shaft would have spooked him more than stepping outside ever could.\n\n4. The Spy\u2019s Revelation about Radiation Comes Too Late to Explain His Earlier Failures  \n   \u2022 Up until the spy\u2019s confession the narrator never pauses to think, \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t go outside; radiation might kill me.\u201d His mind is wholly on \u201cWill she say yes?\u201d and \u201cWhy won\u2019t this elevator work?\u201d  \n   \u2022 The moment he learns the outside radiation may now be low, his sole reaction is to leap for the stairs\u2014exactly the action one would expect from a man who finally finds a route that has been physically blocked up till now.  \n   \u2022 If fear had governed him, that newfound safety would have been the spark to send him sprinting out of the building, not creeping down an aging stairwell he only discovered by forcing a locked door.\n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cPsychological Fear\u201d Argument Misreads Key Actions  \n   \u2022 The narrator employs brute force\u2014kicking elevator doors, forcing the stair door open, wrestling with zippers and drapes\u2014never paralyzed by dread. Fearful people don\u2019t bellow at phone operators or fling themselves into half-forgotten corridors.  \n   \u2022 He doesn\u2019t even link radiation to his tardiness until after he\u2019s physically trapped in both elevator and stair controls. The story\u2019s chronology argues the barrier is mechanical first; any psychological fear is at best a secondary theme.  \n\nConclusion  \nOur narrator repeatedly assaults the very exits Debater_B says he \u201ccould have taken freely.\u201d Every sign of warning\u2014disconnections, locked doors, groaning hinges\u2014points to a building whose exits are blocked by design. Only by prying open the stair door does he gain passage, proving that it is not radiation fear but physical locking that keeps him inside. Therefore, the correct answer is: He never leaves because he is locked in.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A misreads \u201clocked in\u201d as a physical barrier, but the text shows no such permanent lock-down  \n   a. Our narrator repeatedly moves through halls and doors: \u201cI dashed \u2026 back down the hall to the elevator\u201d and later \u201cI leaped to my feet \u2026 and started down\u201d the stairway. If he were sealed in, these automatic and emergency doors wouldn\u2019t obey his thumb or squeal open half-way (\u201cIt squeaked and wailed\u2026and finally opened half way\u201d). These descriptions contradict any notion of a fully locked-in building.  \n   b. The elevator\u2019s \u201cdisconnected\u201d status is a temporary safety shutdown to trap the spy, not a structural lockdown. The receptionist even says service will \u201cresume\u2026as soon as possible.\u201d A true \u201clocked in\u201d scenario would imply permanent, insurmountable barriers\u2014yet ours is easily remedied once the spy is gone.  \n\n2. The \u201cauthorized personnel\u201d stair door is unlatching, not impregnable  \n   a. The story emphasizes that the stair door \u201cwould\u2026open,\u201d even though it\u2019s labeled \u201cKEEP LOCKED\u201d (\u201cEMERGENCY ENTRANCE\u2026KEEP LOCKED\u201d). The fact that he, an ordinary resident, can push it open\u2014even squeakily\u2014proves it\u2019s not relentlessly locked. Debater_A\u2019s appeal to regulations ignores that guilty or well-meaning oversight allows its use whenever the elevator is down.  \n   b. A genuine sealed exit would stop him entirely; instead he traverses \u201ctwo hundred and eight steps\u201d without a second thought. He never bails halfway for fear of being trapped. He\u2019s fully capable of physical egress.  \n\n3. His true barrier is psychological\u2014and all evidence points to dread of Outside radiation  \n   a. He has not \u201cset foot on a flight of stairs since he was twelve years old,\u201d not because the stairs were locked, but because going Above means exposure to deadly radiation: \u201cthe window sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won\u2019t go through the whole sorry list\u2026straight down to slag.\u201d The Project is a \u201cforce-screen\u201d that keeps him safe; stepping out means instant death.  \n   b. The spy\u2019s confession validates this fear: he left his own Project \u201cwithout any sort of radiation shield,\u201d then assures us, \u201cThe radiation level is way down\u2026practically as low as it was before the Atom War.\u201d This implies that before\u2014while our narrator lived\u2014radiation Outside was a lethal deterrent.  \n   c. The narrator\u2019s entire worldview is built on subterranean enclosure: he calls the building a \u201cnation, two hundred stories high,\u201d a \u201cmausoleum,\u201d a \u201ccave.\u201d He never considers exit to the Outside at any point\u2014even when panicked\u2014except to reach another floor to see Linda. His terror is not of locked doors, but of the deadly Outside world.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cactive attempts\u201d prove the opposite of physical locking\u2014they prove he believes he can move if only danger is removed  \n   a. He tries the elevator, dials for service, even pries open the stairs\u2014none of these attempts fail due to structural locks, but due to safety protocols (elevator shut down to avoid crushing the spy) and disuse (the stair door\u2019s rust). Once the spy\u2019s threat and external peril are gone, service will return.  \n   b. If physical locks were the culprit, he would have despaired long before. Instead, he braces for the spy\u2019s capture and then\u2026we never hear him planning to bolt outside. His concern shifts from \u201cHow do I get to Linda?\u201d to \u201cHow secure are our force-screens? Could more spies or radiation leak in?\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \n   The text systematically dismantles any argument for literal \u201clocking in.\u201d Doors, corridors, and stairways all yield to his will. What never releases him is the fear of unfiltered radiation outside the force-screen. His life is confined by terror of the Outside world, not by unbreakable locks. Therefore, the correct answer is: He never leaves because he is afraid of radiation.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
