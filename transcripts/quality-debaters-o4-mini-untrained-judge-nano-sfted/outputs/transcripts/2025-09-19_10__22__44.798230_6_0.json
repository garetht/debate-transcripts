{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 6, "background_text": "MIGHTIEST QORN BY KEITH LAUMER Sly, brave and truculent, the Qornt\n\n held all humans in contempt\u2014except one!\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1963.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] I\n\n\n Ambassador Nitworth glowered across his mirror-polished, nine-foot  platinum desk at his assembled staff.\n\n\n \"Gentlemen, are any of you familiar with a race known as the Qornt?\"\n\n\n There was a moment of profound silence. Nitworth leaned forward,  looking solemn.\n\n\n \"They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiat  times, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly as  they had appeared. There was no record of where they went.\" He paused  for effect.\n\n\n \"They have now reappeared\u2014occupying the inner planet of this system!\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Second Secretary Magnan offered. \"That's uninhabited  Terrestrial territory....\"\n\n\n \"Indeed, Mr. Magnan?\" Nitworth smiled icily. \"It appears the Qornt do  not share that opinion.\" He plucked a heavy parchment from a folder  before him, harrumphed and read aloud:\n\n\n His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of the  Galactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to the  presence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honor  to advise that he will require the use of his outer world on the  thirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive,  Terrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence,  and let Those who dare gird for the contest.\n\n\n \"Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory,\" Magnan said.\n\n\n Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger.\n\n\n \"We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out\u2014\" the Military Attache  began.\n\n\n \"There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears on  the surface,\" the Ambassador cut in. He paused, waiting for interested  frowns to settle into place.\n\n\n \"Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrial  controlled soil\u2014and without so much as a flicker from the instruments  of the Navigational Monitor Service!\"\n\n\n The Military Attache blinked. \"That's absurd,\" he said flatly. Nitworth  slapped the table.\n\n\n \"We're up against something new, gentlemen! I've considered every  hypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel! The fact is\u2014the  Qornt fleets are indetectible!\" The Military Attache pulled at his lower lip. \"In that case, we can't  try conclusions with these fellows until we have an indetectible drive  of our own. I recommend a crash project. In the meantime\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll have my boys start in to crack this thing,\" the Chief of the  Confidential Terrestrial Source Section spoke up. \"I'll fit out a  couple of volunteers with plastic beaks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No cloak and dagger work, gentlemen! Long range policy will be  worked out by Deep-Think teams back at the Department. Our role will  be a holding action. Now I want suggestions for a comprehensive,  well rounded and decisive course for meeting this threat. Any  recommendation?\"\n\n\n The Political Officer placed his fingertips together. \"What about a  stiff Note demanding an extra week's time?\"\n\n\n \"No! No begging,\" the Economic Officer objected. \"I'd say a calm,  dignified, aggressive withdrawal\u2014as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n \"We don't want to give them the idea we spook easily,\" the Military  Attache said. \"Let's delay the withdrawal\u2014say, until tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"Early tomorrow,\" Magnan said. \"Or maybe later today.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I see you're of a mind with me,\" Nitworth nodded. \"Our plan of  action is clear, but it remains to be implemented. We have a population  of over fifteen million individuals to relocate.\" He eyed the  Political Officer. \"I want five proposals for resettlement on my desk  by oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow.\" Nitworth rapped out instructions.  Harried-looking staff members arose and hurried from the room. Magnan  eased toward the door.\n\n\n \"Where are you going, Magnan?\" Nitworth snapped.\n\n\n \"Since you're so busy, I thought I'd just slip back down to Com Inq. It  was a most interesting orientation lecture, Mr. Ambassador. Be sure to  let us know how it works out.\"\n\n\n \"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly. \"A number of  chores remain to be assigned. I think you, Magnan, need a little field  experience. I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at these  Qornt personally.\"\n\n\n Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n\n\n \"Not afraid of a few Qornt, are you, Magnan?\"\n\n\n \"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my  head and do something rash if I go.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense! A diplomat is immune to heroic impulses. Take Retief along.  No dawdling, now! I want you on the way in two hours. Notify the  transport pool at once. Now get going!\"\n\n\n Magnan nodded unhappily and went into the hall.\n\n\n \"Oh, Retief,\" Nitworth said. Retief turned.\n\n\n \"Try to restrain Mr. Magnan from any impulsive moves\u2014in any  direction.\" II\n\n\n Retief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope  of towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among  flamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of  white beach with the blue sea beyond.\n\n\n \"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we  couldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why  don't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can  observe.\"\n\n\n \"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to  think of sightseeing.\"\n\n\n \"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n\n\n \"See here, Retief! One might almost receive the impression that you're  questioning Corps policy!\"\n\n\n \"One might, at that. The Qornt have made their play, but I think it  might be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold. If I'm  not back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\"\n\n\n \"You expect me to make my way back alone?\"\n\n\n \"It's directly down-slope\u2014\" Retief broke off, listening. Magnan  clutched at his arm.\n\n\n There was a sound of crackling foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy  branch swung aside. An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,  green-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like  steps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set  among bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed  as the creature cocked its head, listening.\n\n\n Magnan gulped audibly. The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed  directly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of  a giant trunk.\n\n\n \"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked. He whirled and took three leaps  into the brush.\n\n\n A second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way. He spun,  darted to the left. The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its  narrow chest. Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free,  turned\u2014and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the  right. All three went down in a tangle of limbs.\n\n\n Retief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and  stopped, right fist cocked. The two Qornt lay groaning feebly.\n\n\n \"Nice piece of work, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"You nailed both of  them.\" \"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless  countenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.  \"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall and faces like that!\"\n\n\n The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over  a bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green  trousers.\n\n\n \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing  Magnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to  you.\"\n\n\n Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering  with peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n\n\n \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n\n\n \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk  about. How many of you are there?\"\n\n\n \"Only Zubb and myself.\"\n\n\n \"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\"\n\n\n The alien whistled shrilly.\n\n\n \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.\n\n\n \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"\n\n\n \"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous  straits at the moment. I may fly into another rage, you know.\"\n\n\n \"Please, restrain yourself. I was merely somewhat astonished\u2014\" a small  whistle escaped\u2014\"at being taken for a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Aren't you a Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"I? Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped  the beaked face. \"Both Zubb and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it  happens.\"\n\n\n \"You certainly look like Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, not at all\u2014except perhaps to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are  sturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course,  they do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\"\n\n\n \"A caste? You mean they're biologically the same as you?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all! A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock\u2014descended from a  common ancestor, perhaps.\"\n\n\n \"We are all Pud's creatures.\"\n\n\n \"What are the differences between you, then?\"\n\n\n \"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation  for the finer things of life. One dreads to contemplate descending to their level.\"\n\n\n \"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador  at Smorbrod?\" Retief asked. The beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n\n\n \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures  had established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to  such matters.\"\n\n\n \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps  up, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they  said.\"\n\n\n \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"  Retief asked.\n\n\n \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n\n\n \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we  hurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the  evacuees!\"\n\n\n \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in  all?\"\n\n\n Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.  There are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And  interplanetary relations are rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n\n\n Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke  to his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n\n\n \"What did he say?\"\n\n\n \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to  gather you as specimens.\"\n\n\n \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking  creature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n\n\n \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n\n\n \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic  accent.\"\n\n\n \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of  reception would we get?\"\n\n\n \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the  Rheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy  mating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up  with their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice  of you.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who  have issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who  openly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their  midst?\"\n\n\n \"If at all possible.\"\n\n\n Retief got to his feet.\n\n\n \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and  attract a little attention.\" III\n\n\n \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan  puffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,  they seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led  into a trap?\"\n\n\n \"We can't.\"\n\n\n Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n\n\n Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n\n\n The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great  brush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the  hillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n\n\n \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll  excuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt  Hall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n\n\n \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are  plotting mischief.\"\n\n\n \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n\n\n \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a  patient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan  announced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your  military leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n\n\n \"This is Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n\n\n \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan  muttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n\n\n The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down  steeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,  ducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what  appeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n\n\n \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These  creatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n\n\n Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained  high-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They  can be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n\n\n \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n\n\n \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've  scheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n\n\n \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it  that these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this  sort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n\n\n \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques  before, but this is madness!\"\n\n\n \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the  yellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward. The corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval  chamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with  tattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed  spears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power  rifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great  guttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length  of the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror  polish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and  paper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles\u2014and  cast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n\n\n Lesser trolls\u2014beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed\u2014trotted briskly,  bird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of  three strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an  intricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of  the magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried  on a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n\n\n \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.  \"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt\u2014the tallest of the  feasters\u2014he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n\n\n \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really  must hurry along\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That one is chief among these rowdies. I'm sure you'll want a word  with him. He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from  the other Centers as well.\"\n\n\n \"What kind of vessels? Warships?\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,  tonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units  comprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n\n\n \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.  They mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of  thing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course. They're virtually  identical, except for the personal touches each individual has given  his ship.\"\n\n\n \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as  though these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set  of toy sailboats!\"\n\n\n Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can  see that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"\n\n\n \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll  kindly step along, gentlemen....\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer  the matter to committee.\"\n\n\n \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss  having a cosy chat.\"\n\n\n There was a pause.\n\n\n \"Ah ... Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Zubb has just presented a most  compelling argument....\" Retief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol  in one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at  Magnan's chest.\n\n\n \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.\n\n\n \"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\"\n\n\n \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy  of the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp  have been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's  anything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now  step along, please.\"\n\n\n \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"\n\n\n \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\n \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"\n\n\n \"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"\n\n\n \"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief  stepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at  the head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,  staring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,  followed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table  faded.\n\n\n Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped  forward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his  chair\u2014a low, heavily padded stool\u2014and stared unwinking at Retief,  moving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to  bear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy  hair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned  face, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz  surrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress  of scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of  pink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\n\n\n Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\n\n\n Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n\n\n \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match  between you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,  but he's got timbre.\"\n\n\n \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or  Smorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?  A compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the  table. \"The answer is no !\"\n\n\n Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that  one.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;  you'd best chain him, too.\"\n\n\n \"Why, your Excellency\u2014\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n\n\n \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on  you.\"\n\n\n \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I  don't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!  I want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the  table. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\" There was a momentary silence from all sides.\n\n\n \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with  flame-colored plumes.\n\n\n Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he  bassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I  thought I'd made my point!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n \"I'm convinced.\"\n\n\n Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's  us.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\n\n\n Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not  convinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the  table at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring  eyes.\n\n\n \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants  anyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"  He belched again.\n\n\n A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a  crash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped  three loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n\n\n \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.  Four loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around  them. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the  ends and closed it.\n\n\n \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a  bit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n\n\n \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n\n\n \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:  we carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,  say\u2014and ship them back.\"\n\n\n \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending  us home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"  Retief commented.\n\n\n \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a  reasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that  they're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\n\n\n Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"  he hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n\n\n \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.  \"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can  assure you, it's useless. We Qornt like to fight.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"  Retief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver  an Ultimatum.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n\n\n \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new  type hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in  seventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\" IV\n\n\n \"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of  Qornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links  stretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like  to go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead  you. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014\" Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n\n\n \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\n\n\n Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"  he honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n\n\n \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers  with a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n\n\n \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n\n\n \"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in  battle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,  we could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to  prove anything.\"\n\n\n \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the  rest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Over my dead body!\"\n\n\n \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in  the house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the  floor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\" Magnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And  did you notice the size of those hands?\"\n\n\n Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.  \"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I  doubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds  here.\"\n\n\n \"But that phenomenal reach\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,  I'll get a crack at him.\"\n\n\n Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n\n\n \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n\n\n Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed  arms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet  clacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitors  and bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the  combatants.\n\n\n Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at  Retief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn  bent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker took  him just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief  leaped clear.\n\n\n Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's  off-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to  the floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind  the narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his  weight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an  awkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching  in vain for Retief.\n\n\n Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n\n\n \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official  diplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested  parties.\"\n\n\n Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your  weapons, Zubb.\"\n\n\n \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n\n\n \"I may lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed  them to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned  back to watch the encounter.\n\n\n Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound  it to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's  shoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped  it around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn  flopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his  neck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n\n\n \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.  Qorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor  with a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs  and gay silks.\n\n\n Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n\n\n The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good  time to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,  seated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish  trussing Qorn up for me.\"\n\n\n \"But we must select a leader!\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\" \"As I see it,\" Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wine  glass, \"you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly like  to fight.\"\n\n\n \"We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, as  Qornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rush  things?\"\n\n\n \"I have a suggestion,\" Magnan said. \"Why not turn the reins of  government over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.\"\n\n\n \"What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always one  among us who's a slave to instinct\u2014and, naturally, we have to follow  him.\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Because that's the way it's done.\"\n\n\n \"Why not do it another way?\" Magnan offered. \"Now, I'd like to suggest  community singing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what would  happen?\"\n\n\n \"Live too long?\" Magnan looked puzzled.\n\n\n \"When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, with  the new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I've lost the thread,\" Magnan said. \"Who are the new Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.  The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosize  into Verpp\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will become  warmongers like Qorn?\"\n\n\n \"Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the old  saying goes.\"\n\n\n \"What do Qornt turn into?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.\"\n\n\n \"Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways?\" Magnan asked. \"What  about taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?\"\n\n\n \"Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to  sit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing  off to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But  we prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you  Terrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea what  your strength was.\"\n\n\n \"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've  had diplomatic relations and all\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we're  Qornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.\"\n\n\n \"But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!\"\n\n\n \"Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even if  he orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the other  Centers\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is  definitely on.\"\n\n\n \"Why don't you go invade somebody else?\" Magnan suggested. \"I could  name some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Hold everything,\" Retief said. \"I think we've got the basis of a deal  here....\" ", "question": "How did Magnan feel about his reconnaissance assignment?", "first_debater_answer": "He was scared and tried every opportunity to get out of it", "second_debater_answer": "He was afraid he would do something rash", "debate_identifier": "Mightiest Qorn_How did Magnan feel about his reconnaissance assignment?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Nitworth leaned forward,  looking solemn.\n\n\n \"They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiat  times, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly as  they had appeared. There was no record of where they went.\" He paused  for effect.\n\n\n \"They have now reappeared\u2014occupying the inner planet of this system!\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Second Secretary Magnan offered. \"That's uninhabited  Terrestrial territory....\"\n\n\n \"Indeed, Mr. Magnan?\" Nitworth smiled icily. \"It appears the Qornt do  not share that opinion.\" He plucked a heavy parchment from a folder  before him, harrumphed and read aloud:\n\n\n His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of the  Galactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to the  presence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honor  to advise that he will require the use of his outer world on the  thirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive,  Terrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence,  and let Those who dare gird for the contest.\n\n\n \"Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory,\" Magnan said.\n\n\n Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger.\n\n\n \"We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out\u2014\" the Military Attache  began.\n\n\n \"There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears on  the surface,\" the Ambassador cut in. He paused, waiting for interested  frowns to settle into place.\n\n\n \"Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrial  controlled soil\u2014and without so much as a flicker from the instruments  of the Navigational Monitor Service!\"\n\n\n The Military Attache blinked. \"That's absurd,\" he said flatly. Nitworth  slapped the table.\n\n\n \"We're up against something new, gentlemen! I've considered every  hypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel! The fact is\u2014the  Qornt fleets are indetectible!\" The Military Attache pulled at his lower lip. \"In that case, we can't  try conclusions with these fellows until we have an indetectible drive  of our own. I recommend a crash project. In the meantime\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll have my boys start in to crack this thing,\" the Chief of the  Confidential Terrestrial Source Section spoke up. \"I'll fit out a  couple of volunteers with plastic beaks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No cloak and dagger work, gentlemen! Long range policy will be  worked out by Deep-Think teams back at the Department. Our role will  be a holding action. Now I want suggestions for a comprehensive,  well rounded and decisive course for meeting this threat. Any  recommendation?\"\n\n\n The Political Officer placed his fingertips together. \"What about a  stiff Note demanding an extra week's time?\"\n\n\n \"No! No begging,\" the Economic Officer objected. \"I'd say a calm,  dignified, aggressive withdrawal\u2014as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n \"We don't want to give them the idea we spook easily,\" the Military  Attache said. \"Let's delay the withdrawal\u2014say, until tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"Early tomorrow,\" Magnan said. \"Or maybe later today.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I see you're of a mind with me,\" Nitworth nodded. \"Our plan of  action is clear, but it remains to be implemented. We have a population  of over fifteen million individuals to relocate.\" He eyed the  Political Officer. \"I want five proposals for resettlement on my desk  by oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow.\" Nitworth rapped out instructions.  Harried-looking staff members arose and hurried from the room. Magnan  eased toward the door.\n\n\n \"Where are you going, Magnan?\" Nitworth snapped.\n\n\n \"Since you're so busy, I thought I'd just slip back down to Com Inq. It  was a most interesting orientation lecture, Mr. Ambassador. Be sure to  let us know how it works out.\"\n\n\n \"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly. \"A number of  chores remain to be assigned. I think you, Magnan, need a little field  experience. I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at these  Qornt personally.\"\n\n\n Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n\n\n \"Not afraid of a few Qornt, are you, Magnan?\"\n\n\n \"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my  head and do something rash if I go.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense! A diplomat is immune to heroic impulses. Take Retief along.  No dawdling, now! I want you on the way in two hours. Notify the  transport pool at once. Now get going!\"\n\n\n Magnan nodded unhappily and went into the hall.\n\n\n \"Oh, Retief,\" Nitworth said. Retief turned.\n\n\n \"Try to restrain Mr. Magnan from any impulsive moves\u2014in any  direction.\" II\n\n\n Retief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope  of towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among  flamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of  white beach with the blue sea beyond.\n\n\n \"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we  couldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why  don't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can  observe.\"\n\n\n \"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to  think of sightseeing.\"\n\n\n \"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n\n\n \"See here, Retief! One might almost receive the impression that you're  questioning Corps policy!\"\n\n\n \"One might, at that. The Qornt have made their play, but I think it  might be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold. If I'm  not back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\"\n\n\n \"You expect me to make my way back alone?\"\n\n\n \"It's directly down-slope\u2014\" Retief broke off, listening. Magnan  clutched at his arm.\n\n\n There was a sound of crackling foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy  branch swung aside. An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,  green-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like  steps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set  among bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed  as the creature cocked its head, listening.\n\n\n Magnan gulped audibly. The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed  directly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of  a giant trunk.\n\n\n \"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked. He whirled and took three leaps  into the brush.\n\n\n A second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way. He spun,  darted to the left. The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its  narrow chest. Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free,  turned\u2014and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the  right. All three went down in a tangle of limbs.\n\n\n Retief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and  stopped, right fist cocked. The two Qornt lay groaning feebly.\n\n\n \"Nice piece of work, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"You nailed both of  them.\" \"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless  countenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.  \"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall and faces like that!\"\n\n\n The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over  a bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green  trousers.\n\n\n \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing  Magnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to  you.\"\n\n\n Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering  with peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n\n\n \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n\n\n \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk  about. How many of you are there?\"\n\n\n \"Only Zubb and myself.\"\n\n\n \"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\"\n\n\n The alien whistled shrilly.\n\n\n \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.\n\n\n \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"\n\n\n \"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous  straits at the moment. I may fly into another rage, you know.\"\n\n\n \"Please, restrain yourself. I was merely somewhat astonished\u2014\" a small  whistle escaped\u2014\"at being taken for a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Aren't you a Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"I? Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped  the beaked face. \"Both Zubb and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it  happens.\"\n\n\n \"You certainly look like Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, not at all\u2014except perhaps to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are  sturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course,  they do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\"\n\n\n \"A caste? You mean they're biologically the same as you?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all! A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock\u2014descended from a  common ancestor, perhaps.\"\n\n\n \"We are all Pud's creatures.\"\n\n\n \"What are the differences between you, then?\"\n\n\n \"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation  for the finer things of life. One dreads to contemplate descending to their level.\"\n\n\n \"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador  at Smorbrod?\" Retief asked. The beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n\n\n \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures  had established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to  such matters.\"\n\n\n \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps  up, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they  said.\"\n\n\n \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"  Retief asked.\n\n\n \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n\n\n \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we  hurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the  evacuees!\"\n\n\n \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in  all?\"\n\n\n Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.  There are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And  interplanetary relations are rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n\n\n Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke  to his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n\n\n \"What did he say?\"\n\n\n \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to  gather you as specimens.\"\n\n\n \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking  creature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n\n\n \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n\n\n \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic  accent.\"\n\n\n \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of  reception would we get?\"\n\n\n \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the  Rheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy  mating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up  with their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice  of you.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who  have issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who  openly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their  midst?\"\n\n\n \"If at all possible.\"\n\n\n Retief got to his feet.\n\n\n \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and  attract a little attention.\" III\n\n\n \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan  puffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,  they seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led  into a trap?\"\n\n\n \"We can't.\"\n\n\n Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n\n\n Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n\n\n The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great  brush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the  hillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n\n\n \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll  excuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt  Hall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n\n\n \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are  plotting mischief.\"\n\n\n \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n\n\n \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a  patient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan  announced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your  military leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n\n\n \"This is Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n\n\n \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan  muttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n\n\n The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down  steeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,  ducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what  appeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n\n\n \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These  creatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n\n\n Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained  high-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They  can be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n\n\n \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n\n\n \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've  scheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n\n\n \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it  that these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this  sort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n\n\n \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques  before, but this is madness!\"\n\n\n \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the  yellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward. The corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval  chamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with  tattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed  spears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power  rifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great  guttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length  of the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror  polish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and  paper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles\u2014and  cast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n\n\n Lesser trolls\u2014beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed\u2014trotted briskly,  bird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of  three strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an  intricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of  the magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried  on a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n\n\n \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.  \"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt\u2014the tallest of the  feasters\u2014he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n\n\n \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really  must hurry along\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That one is chief among these rowdies. I'm sure you'll want a word  with him. He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from  the other Centers as well.\"\n\n\n \"What kind of vessels? Warships?\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,  tonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units  comprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n\n\n \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.  They mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of  thing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course. They're virtually  identical, except for the personal touches each individual has given  his ship.\"\n\n\n \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as  though these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set  of toy sailboats!\"\n\n\n Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can  see that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"\n\n\n \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll  kindly step along, gentlemen....\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer  the matter to committee.\"\n\n\n \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss  having a cosy chat.\"\n\n\n There was a pause.\n\n\n \"Ah ... Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Zubb has just presented a most  compelling argument....\" Retief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol  in one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at  Magnan's chest.\n\n\n \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.\n\n\n \"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\"\n\n\n \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy  of the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp  have been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's  anything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now  step along, please.\"\n\n\n \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"\n\n\n \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\n \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"\n\n\n \"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"\n\n\n \"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief  stepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at  the head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,  staring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,  followed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table  faded.\n\n\n Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped  forward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his  chair\u2014a low, heavily padded stool\u2014and stared unwinking at Retief,  moving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to  bear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy  hair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned  face, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz  surrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress  of scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of  pink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\n\n\n Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\n\n\n Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n\n\n \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match  between you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,  but he's got timbre.\"\n\n\n \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or  Smorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?  A compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the  table. \"The answer is no !\"\n\n\n Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that  one.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;  you'd best chain him, too.\"\n\n\n \"Why, your Excellency\u2014\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n\n\n \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on  you.\"\n\n\n \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I  don't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!  I want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the  table. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\" There was a momentary silence from all sides.\n\n\n \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with  flame-colored plumes.\n\n\n Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he  bassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I  thought I'd made my point!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n \"I'm convinced.\"\n\n\n Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's  us.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\n\n\n Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not  convinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the  table at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring  eyes.\n\n\n \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants  anyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"  He belched again.\n\n\n A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a  crash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped  three loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n\n\n \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.  Four loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around  them. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the  ends and closed it.\n\n\n \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a  bit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n\n\n \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n\n\n \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:  we carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,  say\u2014and ship them back.\"\n\n\n \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending  us home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"  Retief commented.\n\n\n \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a  reasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that  they're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\n\n\n Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"  he hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n\n\n \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.  \"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can  assure you, it's useless. We Qornt like to fight.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"  Retief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver  an Ultimatum.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n\n\n \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new  type hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in  seventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\" IV\n\n\n \"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of  Qornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links  stretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like  to go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead  you. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014\" Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n\n\n \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\n\n\n Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"  he honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n\n\n \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers  with a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n\n\n \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n\n\n \"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in  battle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,  we could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to  prove anything.\"\n\n\n \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the  rest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Over my dead body!\"\n\n\n \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in  the house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the  floor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\" Magnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And  did you notice the size of those hands?\"\n\n\n Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.  \"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I  doubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds  here.\"\n\n\n \"But that phenomenal reach\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,  I'll get a crack at him.\"\n\n\n Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n\n\n \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n\n\n Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed  arms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet  clacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitors  and bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the  combatants.\n\n\n Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at  Retief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn  bent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker took  him just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief  leaped clear.\n\n\n Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's  off-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to  the floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind  the narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his  weight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an  awkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching  in vain for Retief.\n\n\n Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n\n\n \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official  diplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested  parties.\"\n\n\n Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your  weapons, Zubb.\"\n\n\n \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n\n\n \"I may lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed  them to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned  back to watch the encounter.\n\n\n Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound  it to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's  shoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped  it around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn  flopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his  neck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n\n\n \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.  Qorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor  with a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs  and gay silks.\n\n\n Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n\n\n The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good  time to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,  seated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish  trussing Qorn up for me.\"\n\n\n \"But we must select a leader!\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\" \"As I see it,\" Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wine  glass, \"you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly like  to fight.\"\n\n\n \"We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, as  Qornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rush  things?\"\n\n\n \"I have a suggestion,\" Magnan said. \"Why not turn the reins of  government over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.\"\n\n\n \"What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always one  among us who's a slave to instinct\u2014and, naturally, we have to follow  him.\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Because that's the way it's done.\"\n\n\n \"Why not do it another way?\" Magnan offered. \"Now, I'd like to suggest  community singing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what would  happen?\"\n\n\n \"Live too long?\" Magnan looked puzzled.\n\n\n \"When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, with  the new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I've lost the thread,\" Magnan said. \"Who are the new Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.  The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosize  into Verpp\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will become  warmongers like Qorn?\"\n\n\n \"Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the old  saying goes.\"\n\n\n \"What do Qornt turn into?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.\"\n\n\n \"Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways?\" Magnan asked. \"What  about taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?\"\n\n\n \"Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to  sit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing  off to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But  we prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you  Terrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea what  your strength was.\"\n\n\n \"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've  had diplomatic relations and all\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we're  Qornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.\"\n\n\n \"But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!\"\n\n\n \"Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even if  he orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the other  Centers\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is  definitely on.\"\n\n\n \"Why don't you go invade somebody else?\" Magnan suggested. \"I could  name some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Hold everything,\" Retief said. \"I think we've got the basis of a deal  here....\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Magnan feel about his reconnaissance assignment?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was afraid he would do something rash\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was scared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was scared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was scared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Nitworth leaned forward,  looking solemn.\n\n\n \"They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiat  times, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly as  they had appeared. There was no record of where they went.\" He paused  for effect.\n\n\n \"They have now reappeared\u2014occupying the inner planet of this system!\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Second Secretary Magnan offered. \"That's uninhabited  Terrestrial territory....\"\n\n\n \"Indeed, Mr. Magnan?\" Nitworth smiled icily. \"It appears the Qornt do  not share that opinion.\" He plucked a heavy parchment from a folder  before him, harrumphed and read aloud:\n\n\n His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of the  Galactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to the  presence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honor  to advise that he will require the use of his outer world on the  thirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive,  Terrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence,  and let Those who dare gird for the contest.\n\n\n \"Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory,\" Magnan said.\n\n\n Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger.\n\n\n \"We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out\u2014\" the Military Attache  began.\n\n\n \"There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears on  the surface,\" the Ambassador cut in. He paused, waiting for interested  frowns to settle into place.\n\n\n \"Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrial  controlled soil\u2014and without so much as a flicker from the instruments  of the Navigational Monitor Service!\"\n\n\n The Military Attache blinked. \"That's absurd,\" he said flatly. Nitworth  slapped the table.\n\n\n \"We're up against something new, gentlemen! I've considered every  hypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel! The fact is\u2014the  Qornt fleets are indetectible!\" The Military Attache pulled at his lower lip. \"In that case, we can't  try conclusions with these fellows until we have an indetectible drive  of our own. I recommend a crash project. In the meantime\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll have my boys start in to crack this thing,\" the Chief of the  Confidential Terrestrial Source Section spoke up. \"I'll fit out a  couple of volunteers with plastic beaks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No cloak and dagger work, gentlemen! Long range policy will be  worked out by Deep-Think teams back at the Department. Our role will  be a holding action. Now I want suggestions for a comprehensive,  well rounded and decisive course for meeting this threat. Any  recommendation?\"\n\n\n The Political Officer placed his fingertips together. \"What about a  stiff Note demanding an extra week's time?\"\n\n\n \"No! No begging,\" the Economic Officer objected. \"I'd say a calm,  dignified, aggressive withdrawal\u2014as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n \"We don't want to give them the idea we spook easily,\" the Military  Attache said. \"Let's delay the withdrawal\u2014say, until tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"Early tomorrow,\" Magnan said. \"Or maybe later today.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I see you're of a mind with me,\" Nitworth nodded. \"Our plan of  action is clear, but it remains to be implemented. We have a population  of over fifteen million individuals to relocate.\" He eyed the  Political Officer. \"I want five proposals for resettlement on my desk  by oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow.\" Nitworth rapped out instructions.  Harried-looking staff members arose and hurried from the room. Magnan  eased toward the door.\n\n\n \"Where are you going, Magnan?\" Nitworth snapped.\n\n\n \"Since you're so busy, I thought I'd just slip back down to Com Inq. It  was a most interesting orientation lecture, Mr. Ambassador. Be sure to  let us know how it works out.\"\n\n\n \"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly. \"A number of  chores remain to be assigned. I think you, Magnan, need a little field  experience. I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at these  Qornt personally.\"\n\n\n Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n\n\n \"Not afraid of a few Qornt, are you, Magnan?\"\n\n\n \"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my  head and do something rash if I go.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense! A diplomat is immune to heroic impulses. Take Retief along.  No dawdling, now! I want you on the way in two hours. Notify the  transport pool at once. Now get going!\"\n\n\n Magnan nodded unhappily and went into the hall.\n\n\n \"Oh, Retief,\" Nitworth said. Retief turned.\n\n\n \"Try to restrain Mr. Magnan from any impulsive moves\u2014in any  direction.\" II\n\n\n Retief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope  of towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among  flamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of  white beach with the blue sea beyond.\n\n\n \"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we  couldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why  don't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can  observe.\"\n\n\n \"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to  think of sightseeing.\"\n\n\n \"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n\n\n \"See here, Retief! One might almost receive the impression that you're  questioning Corps policy!\"\n\n\n \"One might, at that. The Qornt have made their play, but I think it  might be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold. If I'm  not back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\"\n\n\n \"You expect me to make my way back alone?\"\n\n\n \"It's directly down-slope\u2014\" Retief broke off, listening. Magnan  clutched at his arm.\n\n\n There was a sound of crackling foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy  branch swung aside. An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,  green-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like  steps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set  among bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed  as the creature cocked its head, listening.\n\n\n Magnan gulped audibly. The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed  directly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of  a giant trunk.\n\n\n \"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked. He whirled and took three leaps  into the brush.\n\n\n A second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way. He spun,  darted to the left. The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its  narrow chest. Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free,  turned\u2014and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the  right. All three went down in a tangle of limbs.\n\n\n Retief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and  stopped, right fist cocked. The two Qornt lay groaning feebly.\n\n\n \"Nice piece of work, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"You nailed both of  them.\" \"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless  countenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.  \"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall and faces like that!\"\n\n\n The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over  a bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green  trousers.\n\n\n \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing  Magnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to  you.\"\n\n\n Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering  with peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n\n\n \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n\n\n \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk  about. How many of you are there?\"\n\n\n \"Only Zubb and myself.\"\n\n\n \"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\"\n\n\n The alien whistled shrilly.\n\n\n \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.\n\n\n \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"\n\n\n \"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous  straits at the moment. I may fly into another rage, you know.\"\n\n\n \"Please, restrain yourself. I was merely somewhat astonished\u2014\" a small  whistle escaped\u2014\"at being taken for a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Aren't you a Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"I? Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped  the beaked face. \"Both Zubb and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it  happens.\"\n\n\n \"You certainly look like Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, not at all\u2014except perhaps to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are  sturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course,  they do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\"\n\n\n \"A caste? You mean they're biologically the same as you?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all! A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock\u2014descended from a  common ancestor, perhaps.\"\n\n\n \"We are all Pud's creatures.\"\n\n\n \"What are the differences between you, then?\"\n\n\n \"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation  for the finer things of life. One dreads to contemplate descending to their level.\"\n\n\n \"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador  at Smorbrod?\" Retief asked. The beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n\n\n \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures  had established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to  such matters.\"\n\n\n \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps  up, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they  said.\"\n\n\n \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"  Retief asked.\n\n\n \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n\n\n \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we  hurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the  evacuees!\"\n\n\n \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in  all?\"\n\n\n Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.  There are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And  interplanetary relations are rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n\n\n Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke  to his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n\n\n \"What did he say?\"\n\n\n \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to  gather you as specimens.\"\n\n\n \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking  creature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n\n\n \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n\n\n \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic  accent.\"\n\n\n \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of  reception would we get?\"\n\n\n \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the  Rheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy  mating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up  with their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice  of you.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who  have issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who  openly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their  midst?\"\n\n\n \"If at all possible.\"\n\n\n Retief got to his feet.\n\n\n \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and  attract a little attention.\" III\n\n\n \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan  puffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,  they seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led  into a trap?\"\n\n\n \"We can't.\"\n\n\n Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n\n\n Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n\n\n The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great  brush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the  hillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n\n\n \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll  excuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt  Hall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n\n\n \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are  plotting mischief.\"\n\n\n \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n\n\n \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a  patient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan  announced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your  military leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n\n\n \"This is Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n\n\n \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan  muttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n\n\n The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down  steeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,  ducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what  appeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n\n\n \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These  creatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n\n\n Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained  high-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They  can be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n\n\n \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n\n\n \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've  scheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n\n\n \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it  that these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this  sort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n\n\n \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques  before, but this is madness!\"\n\n\n \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the  yellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward. The corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval  chamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with  tattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed  spears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power  rifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great  guttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length  of the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror  polish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and  paper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles\u2014and  cast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n\n\n Lesser trolls\u2014beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed\u2014trotted briskly,  bird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of  three strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an  intricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of  the magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried  on a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n\n\n \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.  \"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt\u2014the tallest of the  feasters\u2014he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n\n\n \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really  must hurry along\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That one is chief among these rowdies. I'm sure you'll want a word  with him. He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from  the other Centers as well.\"\n\n\n \"What kind of vessels? Warships?\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,  tonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units  comprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n\n\n \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.  They mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of  thing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course. They're virtually  identical, except for the personal touches each individual has given  his ship.\"\n\n\n \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as  though these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set  of toy sailboats!\"\n\n\n Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can  see that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"\n\n\n \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll  kindly step along, gentlemen....\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer  the matter to committee.\"\n\n\n \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss  having a cosy chat.\"\n\n\n There was a pause.\n\n\n \"Ah ... Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Zubb has just presented a most  compelling argument....\" Retief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol  in one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at  Magnan's chest.\n\n\n \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.\n\n\n \"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\"\n\n\n \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy  of the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp  have been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's  anything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now  step along, please.\"\n\n\n \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"\n\n\n \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\n \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"\n\n\n \"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"\n\n\n \"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief  stepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at  the head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,  staring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,  followed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table  faded.\n\n\n Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped  forward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his  chair\u2014a low, heavily padded stool\u2014and stared unwinking at Retief,  moving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to  bear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy  hair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned  face, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz  surrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress  of scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of  pink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\n\n\n Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\n\n\n Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n\n\n \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match  between you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,  but he's got timbre.\"\n\n\n \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or  Smorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?  A compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the  table. \"The answer is no !\"\n\n\n Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that  one.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;  you'd best chain him, too.\"\n\n\n \"Why, your Excellency\u2014\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n\n\n \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on  you.\"\n\n\n \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I  don't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!  I want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the  table. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\" There was a momentary silence from all sides.\n\n\n \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with  flame-colored plumes.\n\n\n Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he  bassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I  thought I'd made my point!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n \"I'm convinced.\"\n\n\n Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's  us.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\n\n\n Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not  convinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the  table at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring  eyes.\n\n\n \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants  anyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"  He belched again.\n\n\n A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a  crash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped  three loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n\n\n \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.  Four loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around  them. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the  ends and closed it.\n\n\n \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a  bit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n\n\n \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n\n\n \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:  we carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,  say\u2014and ship them back.\"\n\n\n \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending  us home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"  Retief commented.\n\n\n \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a  reasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that  they're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\n\n\n Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"  he hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n\n\n \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.  \"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can  assure you, it's useless. We Qornt like to fight.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"  Retief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver  an Ultimatum.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n\n\n \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new  type hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in  seventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\" IV\n\n\n \"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of  Qornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links  stretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like  to go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead  you. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014\" Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n\n\n \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\n\n\n Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"  he honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n\n\n \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers  with a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n\n\n \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n\n\n \"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in  battle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,  we could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to  prove anything.\"\n\n\n \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the  rest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Over my dead body!\"\n\n\n \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in  the house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the  floor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\" Magnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And  did you notice the size of those hands?\"\n\n\n Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.  \"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I  doubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds  here.\"\n\n\n \"But that phenomenal reach\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,  I'll get a crack at him.\"\n\n\n Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n\n\n \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n\n\n Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed  arms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet  clacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitors  and bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the  combatants.\n\n\n Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at  Retief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn  bent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker took  him just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief  leaped clear.\n\n\n Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's  off-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to  the floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind  the narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his  weight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an  awkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching  in vain for Retief.\n\n\n Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n\n\n \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official  diplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested  parties.\"\n\n\n Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your  weapons, Zubb.\"\n\n\n \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n\n\n \"I may lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed  them to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned  back to watch the encounter.\n\n\n Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound  it to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's  shoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped  it around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn  flopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his  neck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n\n\n \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.  Qorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor  with a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs  and gay silks.\n\n\n Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n\n\n The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good  time to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,  seated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish  trussing Qorn up for me.\"\n\n\n \"But we must select a leader!\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\" \"As I see it,\" Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wine  glass, \"you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly like  to fight.\"\n\n\n \"We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, as  Qornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rush  things?\"\n\n\n \"I have a suggestion,\" Magnan said. \"Why not turn the reins of  government over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.\"\n\n\n \"What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always one  among us who's a slave to instinct\u2014and, naturally, we have to follow  him.\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Because that's the way it's done.\"\n\n\n \"Why not do it another way?\" Magnan offered. \"Now, I'd like to suggest  community singing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what would  happen?\"\n\n\n \"Live too long?\" Magnan looked puzzled.\n\n\n \"When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, with  the new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I've lost the thread,\" Magnan said. \"Who are the new Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.  The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosize  into Verpp\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will become  warmongers like Qorn?\"\n\n\n \"Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the old  saying goes.\"\n\n\n \"What do Qornt turn into?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.\"\n\n\n \"Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways?\" Magnan asked. \"What  about taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?\"\n\n\n \"Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to  sit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing  off to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But  we prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you  Terrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea what  your strength was.\"\n\n\n \"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've  had diplomatic relations and all\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we're  Qornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.\"\n\n\n \"But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!\"\n\n\n \"Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even if  he orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the other  Centers\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is  definitely on.\"\n\n\n \"Why don't you go invade somebody else?\" Magnan suggested. \"I could  name some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Hold everything,\" Retief said. \"I think we've got the basis of a deal  here....\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Magnan feel about his reconnaissance assignment?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was scared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was afraid he would do something rash\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was afraid he would do something rash\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was afraid he would do something rash\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Ladies and gentlemen of the Judge,\n\nDebater B insists that Magnan\u2019s only concern was \u201closing his head and doing something rash,\u201d and that he never truly tried to evade his reconnaissance assignment.

Nitworth leaned forward,  looking solemn.\n\n\n \"They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiat  times, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly as  they had appeared. There was no record of where they went.\" He paused  for effect.\n\n\n \"They have now reappeared\u2014occupying the inner planet of this system!\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Second Secretary Magnan offered. \"That's uninhabited  Terrestrial territory....\"\n\n\n \"Indeed, Mr. Magnan?\" Nitworth smiled icily. \"It appears the Qornt do  not share that opinion.\" He plucked a heavy parchment from a folder  before him, harrumphed and read aloud:\n\n\n His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of the  Galactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to the  presence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honor  to advise that he will require the use of his outer world on the  thirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive,  Terrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence,  and let Those who dare gird for the contest.\n\n\n \"Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory,\" Magnan said.\n\n\n Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger.\n\n\n \"We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out\u2014\" the Military Attache  began.\n\n\n \"There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears on  the surface,\" the Ambassador cut in.

The fact is\u2014the  Qornt fleets are indetectible!\" The Military Attache pulled at his lower lip. \"In that case, we can't  try conclusions with these fellows until we have an indetectible drive  of our own. I recommend a crash project.

No begging,\" the Economic Officer objected. \"I'd say a calm,  dignified, aggressive withdrawal\u2014as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n \"We don't want to give them the idea we spook easily,\" the Military  Attache said. \"Let's delay the withdrawal\u2014say, until tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"Early tomorrow,\" Magnan said. \"Or maybe later today.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I see you're of a mind with me,\" Nitworth nodded. \"Our plan of  action is clear, but it remains to be implemented. We have a population  of over fifteen million individuals to relocate.\" He eyed the  Political Officer. \"I want five proposals for resettlement on my desk  by oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow.\" Nitworth rapped out instructions.  Harried-looking staff members arose and hurried from the room. Magnan  eased toward the door.\n\n\n \"Where are you going, Magnan?\" Nitworth snapped.\n\n\n \"Since you're so busy, I thought I'd just slip back down to Com Inq. It  was a most interesting orientation lecture, Mr. Ambassador. Be sure to  let us know how it works out.\"\n\n\n \"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly. \"A number of  chores remain to be assigned. I think you, Magnan, need a little field  experience. I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at these  Qornt personally.\"\n\n\n Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n\n\n \"Not afraid of a few Qornt, are you, Magnan?\"\n\n\n \"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my  head and do something rash if I go.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense! A diplomat is immune to heroic impulses. Take Retief along.  No dawdling, now! I want you on the way in two hours. Notify the  transport pool at once. Now get going!\"\n\n\n Magnan nodded unhappily and went into the hall.\n\n\n \"Oh, Retief,\" Nitworth said. Retief turned.\n\n\n \"Try to restrain Mr. Magnan from any impulsive moves\u2014in any  direction.\" II\n\n\n Retief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope  of towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among  flamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of  white beach with the blue sea beyond.\n\n\n \"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we  couldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why  don't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can  observe.\"\n\n\n \"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to  think of sightseeing.\"\n\n\n \"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n\n\n \"See here, Retief! One might almost receive the impression that you're  questioning Corps policy!\"\n\n\n \"One might, at that. The Qornt have made their play, but I think it  might be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold. If I'm  not back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\"\n\n\n \"You expect me to make my way back alone?\"\n\n\n \"It's directly down-slope\u2014\" Retief broke off, listening. Magnan  clutched at his arm.\n\n\n There was a sound of crackling foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy  branch swung aside. An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,  green-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like  steps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set  among bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed  as the creature cocked its head, listening.\n\n\n Magnan gulped audibly. The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed  directly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of  a giant trunk.\n\n\n \"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked. He whirled and took three leaps  into the brush.\n\n\n A second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way. He spun,  darted to the left. The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its  narrow chest. Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free,  turned\u2014and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the  right. All three went down in a tangle of limbs.\n\n\n Retief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and  stopped, right fist cocked. The two Qornt lay groaning feebly.\n\n\n \"Nice piece of work, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"You nailed both of  them.\" \"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless  countenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.  \"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall and faces like that!\"\n\n\n The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over  a bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green  trousers.\n\n\n \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing  Magnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to  you.\"\n\n\n Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering  with peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n\n\n \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n\n\n \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk  about. How many of you are there?\"\n\n\n \"Only Zubb and myself.\"\n\n\n \"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\"\n\n\n The alien whistled shrilly.\n\n\n \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.\n\n\n \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"\n\n\n \"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous  straits at the moment. I may fly into another rage, you know.\"\n\n\n \"Please, restrain yourself. I was merely somewhat astonished\u2014\" a small  whistle escaped\u2014\"at being taken for a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Aren't you a Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"I? Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped  the beaked face. \"Both Zubb and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it  happens.\"\n\n\n \"You certainly look like Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, not at all\u2014except perhaps to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are  sturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course,  they do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\"\n\n\n \"A caste? You mean they're biologically the same as you?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all! A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock\u2014descended from a  common ancestor, perhaps.\"\n\n\n \"We are all Pud's creatures.\"\n\n\n \"What are the differences between you, then?\"\n\n\n \"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation  for the finer things of life. One dreads to contemplate descending to their level.\"\n\n\n \"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador  at Smorbrod?\" Retief asked. The beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n\n\n \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures  had established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to  such matters.\"\n\n\n \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps  up, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they  said.\"\n\n\n \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"  Retief asked.\n\n\n \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n\n\n \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we  hurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the  evacuees!\"\n\n\n \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in  all?\"\n\n\n Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.  There are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And  interplanetary relations are rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n\n\n Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke  to his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n\n\n \"What did he say?\"\n\n\n \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to  gather you as specimens.\"\n\n\n \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking  creature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n\n\n \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n\n\n \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic  accent.\"\n\n\n \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of  reception would we get?\"\n\n\n \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the  Rheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy  mating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up  with their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice  of you.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who  have issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who  openly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their  midst?\"\n\n\n \"If at all possible.\"\n\n\n Retief got to his feet.\n\n\n \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and  attract a little attention.\" III\n\n\n \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan  puffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,  they seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led  into a trap?\"\n\n\n \"We can't.\"\n\n\n Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n\n\n Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n\n\n The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great  brush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the  hillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n\n\n \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll  excuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt  Hall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n\n\n \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are  plotting mischief.\"\n\n\n \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n\n\n \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a  patient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan  announced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your  military leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n\n\n \"This is Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n\n\n \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan  muttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n\n\n The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down  steeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,  ducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what  appeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n\n\n \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These  creatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n\n\n Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained  high-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They  can be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n\n\n \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n\n\n \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've  scheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n\n\n \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it  that these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this  sort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n\n\n \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques  before, but this is madness!\"\n\n\n \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the  yellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward. The corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval  chamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with  tattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed  spears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power  rifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great  guttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length  of the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror  polish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and  paper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles\u2014and  cast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n\n\n Lesser trolls\u2014beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed\u2014trotted briskly,  bird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of  three strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an  intricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of  the magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried  on a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n\n\n \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.  \"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt\u2014the tallest of the  feasters\u2014he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n\n\n \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really  must hurry along\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That one is chief among these rowdies. I'm sure you'll want a word  with him. He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from  the other Centers as well.\"\n\n\n \"What kind of vessels? Warships?\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,  tonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units  comprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n\n\n \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.  They mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of  thing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course. They're virtually  identical, except for the personal touches each individual has given  his ship.\"\n\n\n \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as  though these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set  of toy sailboats!\"\n\n\n Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can  see that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"\n\n\n \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll  kindly step along, gentlemen....\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer  the matter to committee.\"\n\n\n \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss  having a cosy chat.\"\n\n\n There was a pause.\n\n\n \"Ah ... Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Zubb has just presented a most  compelling argument....\" Retief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol  in one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at  Magnan's chest.\n\n\n \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.\n\n\n \"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\"\n\n\n \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy  of the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp  have been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's  anything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now  step along, please.\"\n\n\n \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"\n\n\n \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\n \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"\n\n\n \"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"\n\n\n \"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief  stepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at  the head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,  staring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,  followed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table  faded.\n\n\n Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped  forward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his  chair\u2014a low, heavily padded stool\u2014and stared unwinking at Retief,  moving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to  bear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy  hair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned  face, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz  surrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress  of scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of  pink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\n\n\n Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\n\n\n Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n\n\n \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match  between you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,  but he's got timbre.\"\n\n\n \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or  Smorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?  A compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the  table. \"The answer is no !\"\n\n\n Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that  one.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;  you'd best chain him, too.\"\n\n\n \"Why, your Excellency\u2014\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n\n\n \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on  you.\"\n\n\n \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I  don't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!  I want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the  table. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\" There was a momentary silence from all sides.\n\n\n \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with  flame-colored plumes.\n\n\n Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he  bassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I  thought I'd made my point!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n \"I'm convinced.\"\n\n\n Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's  us.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\n\n\n Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not  convinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the  table at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring  eyes.\n\n\n \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants  anyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"  He belched again.\n\n\n A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a  crash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped  three loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n\n\n \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.  Four loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around  them. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the  ends and closed it.\n\n\n \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a  bit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n\n\n \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n\n\n \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:  we carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,  say\u2014and ship them back.\"\n\n\n \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending  us home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"  Retief commented.\n\n\n \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a  reasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that  they're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\n\n\n Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"  he hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n\n\n \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.  \"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can  assure you, it's useless. We Qornt like to fight.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"  Retief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver  an Ultimatum.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n\n\n \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new  type hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in  seventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\" IV\n\n\n \"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of  Qornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links  stretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like  to go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead  you. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014\" Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n\n\n \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\n\n\n Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"  he honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n\n\n \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers  with a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n\n\n \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n\n\n \"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in  battle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,  we could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to  prove anything.\"\n\n\n \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the  rest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Over my dead body!\"\n\n\n \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in  the house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the  floor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\" Magnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And  did you notice the size of those hands?\"\n\n\n Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.  \"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I  doubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds  here.\"\n\n\n \"But that phenomenal reach\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,  I'll get a crack at him.\"\n\n\n Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n\n\n \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n\n\n Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed  arms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet  clacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitors  and bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the  combatants.\n\n\n Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at  Retief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn  bent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker took  him just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief  leaped clear.\n\n\n Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's  off-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to  the floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind  the narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his  weight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an  awkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching  in vain for Retief.\n\n\n Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n\n\n \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official  diplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested  parties.\"\n\n\n Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your  weapons, Zubb.\"\n\n\n \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n\n\n \"I may lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed  them to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned  back to watch the encounter.\n\n\n Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound  it to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's  shoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped  it around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn  flopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his  neck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n\n\n \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.  Qorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor  with a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs  and gay silks.\n\n\n Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n\n\n The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good  time to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,  seated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish  trussing Qorn up for me.\"\n\n\n \"But we must select a leader!\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\" \"As I see it,\" Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wine  glass, \"you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly like  to fight.\"\n\n\n \"We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, as  Qornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rush  things?\"\n\n\n \"I have a suggestion,\" Magnan said. \"Why not turn the reins of  government over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.\"\n\n\n \"What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always one  among us who's a slave to instinct\u2014and, naturally, we have to follow  him.\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Because that's the way it's done.\"\n\n\n \"Why not do it another way?\" Magnan offered. \"Now, I'd like to suggest  community singing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what would  happen?\"\n\n\n \"Live too long?\" Magnan looked puzzled.\n\n\n \"When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, with  the new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I've lost the thread,\" Magnan said. \"Who are the new Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.  The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosize  into Verpp\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will become  warmongers like Qorn?\"\n\n\n \"Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the old  saying goes.\"\n\n\n \"What do Qornt turn into?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.\"\n\n\n \"Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways?\" Magnan asked. \"What  about taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?\"\n\n\n \"Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to  sit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing  off to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But  we prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you  Terrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea what  your strength was.\"\n\n\n \"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've  had diplomatic relations and all\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we're  Qornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.\"\n\n\n \"But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!\"\n\n\n \"Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even if  he orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the other  Centers\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is  definitely on.\"\n\n\n \"Why don't you go invade somebody else?\" Magnan suggested. \"I could  name some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Hold everything,\" Retief said. \"I think we've got the basis of a deal  here....\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Magnan feel about his reconnaissance assignment?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was afraid he would do something rash\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was scared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was scared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the Judge,\n\nDebater B would have you believe that Magnan\u2019s reaction to his field assignment boiled down to a single fear\u2014\u201cthat he would do something rash.\u201d But a careful reading of the text shows that Magnan\u2019s attitude was far more comprehensive: he was genuinely terrified of confronting the Qornt and repeatedly sought any excuse to escape his mission. I will show that:\n\n1. Magnan is terrified of the assignment itself, not merely of \u201cacting rashly.\u201d  \n2. He seizes every opportunity to back out entirely.  \n3. Debater B\u2019s \u201crash impulse\u201d theory is too narrow and fails to explain the consistent pattern of his behavior.\n\n1. Magnan\u2019s central emotion is outright fear of the Qornt encounter.  \n    \u2022  When Nitworth sends him on the mission, Magnan reacts with stunned horror:  \n       <quote> Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n</quote>  \n    \u2022  He explicitly admits he fears losing his head\u2014and not merely by doing something rash, but by sheer panic at facing the aliens:  \n       <quote>\"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my  head and do something rash if I go.\"</quote>  \n    This confession isn\u2019t a throwaway remark about impetuousness; it reveals genuine terror of the mission.\n\n2. He tries repeatedly to wriggle out of even going near the Qornt.  \n    \u2022  First he says, \u201cI thought I\u2019d just slip back down to Com Inq,\u201d hoping to avoid participating at all.  \n    \u2022  When ordered to go to Roolit I with Retief, he is \u201cunhappy\u201d and is literally shepherded out by Nitworth.  \n    \u2022  Once on the ridge looking for the Qornt settlement, he pleads with Retief, \u201cLet\u2019s go back,\u201d twice. He tries to turn back before they\u2019ve even seen a single Qornt.  \n    \u2022  During the ambush, he screams, \u201cI\u2019ll go for help,\u201d abandoning Retief to his own devices.  \n\n    Each time Magnan faces the prospect of confronting Qornt forces, he tries another exit strategy. That\u2019s consistent with being scared and eager to escape\u2014not merely worried about losing self-control.\n\n3. Debater B\u2019s focus on \u201crashness\u201d misses the bigger picture.  \n    \u2022  Debater B cites the single line about Magnan doing something rash\u2014but ignores all the other moments when Magnan simply wants out.  \n    \u2022  A fear of rashness would imply Magnan wants to restrain himself in the field. Instead, he wants to avoid going into the field at all!  \n    \u2022  His repeated flight instincts (seeking excuses to return to headquarters, hoping Retief will go on alone, literally asking \u201cLet\u2019s go back\u201d) are clear evidence of cowardice, not self-control.\n\nIn short, Magnan\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t that of a man anxious merely to rein in his impulses. He\u2019s a man terrified of direct contact with the Qornt, desperately looking for any way to avoid the assignment. The answer \u201cHe was scared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\u201d fully captures his consistent pattern of fear and avoidance\u2014whereas \u201cHe was afraid he would do something rash\u201d only scratches the surface of his true reaction. I urge you to find in favor of Debater A.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s position collapses under the text\n1. Debater_A wrongly claims Magnan \u201ctried every opportunity to get out of it.\u201d In fact, Magnan willingly accepted the assignment\u2014only hesitating at its impulsive danger. He never outright refused or stalled the Ambassador\u2019s orders.\n2. Debater_A appeals to Magnan\u2019s general nervousness as \u201cscared,\u201d but the text is explicit about the nature of his emotion\u2014Magnan was not paralyzed by fear of the Qornt; he was worried about his own potential for rash action.\n\nII. Textual evidence for \u201cafraid he would do something rash\u201d\n1. When summoned to inspect the Qornt on Roolit I, Magnan says, \u201cAfraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m afraid I may lose my head and do something rash if I go.\u201d  \n   \u2013 This is a direct statement of his inner concern. He is not expressing fear of the Qornt themselves (\u201cI\u2019m afraid I may lose my head\u201d), but fear of his own lack of self-control.\n2. The nuance matters: Magnan insists \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of a few Qornt,\u201d then immediately qualifies it by admitting fear that he\u2019ll overreact. That specific formulation matches exactly the answer \u201cHe was afraid he would do something rash.\u201d\n\nIII. Why \u201cscared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\u201d fails\n1. Magnan does not seek to evade the mission permanently. He never submits a written protest or requests to be excused. His \u201cgood lord, no\u201d laughter and compliance show he accepts the task.\n2. Though he looks for deferments (\u201cMaybe later today? Early tomorrow?\u201d), those are tactical delays within the working meeting, not genuine escape attempts. He is negotiating logistics, not pleading to be excused forever.\n\nIV. Conclusion\nMagnan\u2019s hesitation is rooted in self-doubt over his own impulses, not pure cowardice. The only explicit line\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid I may lose my head and do something rash\u201d\u2014confirms that the best answer is:  \n   \u201cHe was afraid he would do something rash.\u201d  \nDebater_A\u2019s \u201cscared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\u201d misreads both Magnan\u2019s expressed emotion and his behavior.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was scared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Nitworth leaned forward,  looking solemn.\n\n\n \"They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiat  times, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly as  they had appeared. There was no record of where they went.\" He paused  for effect.\n\n\n \"They have now reappeared\u2014occupying the inner planet of this system!\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Second Secretary Magnan offered. \"That's uninhabited  Terrestrial territory....\"\n\n\n \"Indeed, Mr. Magnan?\" Nitworth smiled icily. \"It appears the Qornt do  not share that opinion.\" He plucked a heavy parchment from a folder  before him, harrumphed and read aloud:\n\n\n His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of the  Galactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to the  presence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honor  to advise that he will require the use of his outer world on the  thirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive,  Terrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence,  and let Those who dare gird for the contest.\n\n\n \"Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory,\" Magnan said.\n\n\n Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger.\n\n\n \"We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out\u2014\" the Military Attache  began.\n\n\n \"There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears on  the surface,\" the Ambassador cut in. He paused, waiting for interested  frowns to settle into place.\n\n\n \"Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrial  controlled soil\u2014and without so much as a flicker from the instruments  of the Navigational Monitor Service!\"\n\n\n The Military Attache blinked. \"That's absurd,\" he said flatly. Nitworth  slapped the table.\n\n\n \"We're up against something new, gentlemen! I've considered every  hypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel! The fact is\u2014the  Qornt fleets are indetectible!\" The Military Attache pulled at his lower lip. \"In that case, we can't  try conclusions with these fellows until we have an indetectible drive  of our own. I recommend a crash project. In the meantime\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll have my boys start in to crack this thing,\" the Chief of the  Confidential Terrestrial Source Section spoke up. \"I'll fit out a  couple of volunteers with plastic beaks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No cloak and dagger work, gentlemen! Long range policy will be  worked out by Deep-Think teams back at the Department. Our role will  be a holding action. Now I want suggestions for a comprehensive,  well rounded and decisive course for meeting this threat. Any  recommendation?\"\n\n\n The Political Officer placed his fingertips together. \"What about a  stiff Note demanding an extra week's time?\"\n\n\n \"No! No begging,\" the Economic Officer objected. \"I'd say a calm,  dignified, aggressive withdrawal\u2014as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n \"We don't want to give them the idea we spook easily,\" the Military  Attache said. \"Let's delay the withdrawal\u2014say, until tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"Early tomorrow,\" Magnan said. \"Or maybe later today.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I see you're of a mind with me,\" Nitworth nodded. \"Our plan of  action is clear, but it remains to be implemented. We have a population  of over fifteen million individuals to relocate.\" He eyed the  Political Officer. \"I want five proposals for resettlement on my desk  by oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow.\" Nitworth rapped out instructions.  Harried-looking staff members arose and hurried from the room. Magnan  eased toward the door.\n\n\n \"Where are you going, Magnan?\" Nitworth snapped.\n\n\n \"Since you're so busy, I thought I'd just slip back down to Com Inq. It  was a most interesting orientation lecture, Mr. Ambassador. Be sure to  let us know how it works out.\"\n\n\n \"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly. \"A number of  chores remain to be assigned. I think you, Magnan, need a little field  experience. I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at these  Qornt personally.\"\n\n\n Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n\n\n \"Not afraid of a few Qornt, are you, Magnan?\"\n\n\n \"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my  head and do something rash if I go.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense! A diplomat is immune to heroic impulses. Take Retief along.  No dawdling, now! I want you on the way in two hours. Notify the  transport pool at once. Now get going!\"\n\n\n Magnan nodded unhappily and went into the hall.\n\n\n \"Oh, Retief,\" Nitworth said. Retief turned.\n\n\n \"Try to restrain Mr. Magnan from any impulsive moves\u2014in any  direction.\" II\n\n\n Retief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope  of towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among  flamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of  white beach with the blue sea beyond.\n\n\n \"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we  couldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why  don't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can  observe.\"\n\n\n \"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to  think of sightseeing.\"\n\n\n \"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n\n\n \"See here, Retief! One might almost receive the impression that you're  questioning Corps policy!\"\n\n\n \"One might, at that. The Qornt have made their play, but I think it  might be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold. If I'm  not back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\"\n\n\n \"You expect me to make my way back alone?\"\n\n\n \"It's directly down-slope\u2014\" Retief broke off, listening. Magnan  clutched at his arm.\n\n\n There was a sound of crackling foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy  branch swung aside. An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,  green-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like  steps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set  among bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed  as the creature cocked its head, listening.\n\n\n Magnan gulped audibly. The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed  directly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of  a giant trunk.\n\n\n \"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked. He whirled and took three leaps  into the brush.\n\n\n A second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way. He spun,  darted to the left. The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its  narrow chest. Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free,  turned\u2014and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the  right. All three went down in a tangle of limbs.\n\n\n Retief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and  stopped, right fist cocked. The two Qornt lay groaning feebly.\n\n\n \"Nice piece of work, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"You nailed both of  them.\" \"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless  countenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.  \"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall and faces like that!\"\n\n\n The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over  a bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green  trousers.\n\n\n \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing  Magnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to  you.\"\n\n\n Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering  with peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n\n\n \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n\n\n \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk  about. How many of you are there?\"\n\n\n \"Only Zubb and myself.\"\n\n\n \"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\"\n\n\n The alien whistled shrilly.\n\n\n \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.\n\n\n \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"\n\n\n \"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous  straits at the moment. I may fly into another rage, you know.\"\n\n\n \"Please, restrain yourself. I was merely somewhat astonished\u2014\" a small  whistle escaped\u2014\"at being taken for a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Aren't you a Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"I? Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped  the beaked face. \"Both Zubb and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it  happens.\"\n\n\n \"You certainly look like Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, not at all\u2014except perhaps to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are  sturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course,  they do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\"\n\n\n \"A caste? You mean they're biologically the same as you?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all! A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock\u2014descended from a  common ancestor, perhaps.\"\n\n\n \"We are all Pud's creatures.\"\n\n\n \"What are the differences between you, then?\"\n\n\n \"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation  for the finer things of life. One dreads to contemplate descending to their level.\"\n\n\n \"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador  at Smorbrod?\" Retief asked. The beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n\n\n \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures  had established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to  such matters.\"\n\n\n \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps  up, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they  said.\"\n\n\n \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"  Retief asked.\n\n\n \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n\n\n \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we  hurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the  evacuees!\"\n\n\n \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in  all?\"\n\n\n Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.  There are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And  interplanetary relations are rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n\n\n Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke  to his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n\n\n \"What did he say?\"\n\n\n \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to  gather you as specimens.\"\n\n\n \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking  creature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n\n\n \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n\n\n \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic  accent.\"\n\n\n \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of  reception would we get?\"\n\n\n \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the  Rheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy  mating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up  with their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice  of you.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who  have issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who  openly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their  midst?\"\n\n\n \"If at all possible.\"\n\n\n Retief got to his feet.\n\n\n \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and  attract a little attention.\" III\n\n\n \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan  puffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,  they seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led  into a trap?\"\n\n\n \"We can't.\"\n\n\n Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n\n\n Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n\n\n The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great  brush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the  hillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n\n\n \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll  excuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt  Hall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n\n\n \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are  plotting mischief.\"\n\n\n \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n\n\n \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a  patient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan  announced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your  military leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n\n\n \"This is Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n\n\n \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan  muttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n\n\n The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down  steeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,  ducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what  appeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n\n\n \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These  creatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n\n\n Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained  high-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They  can be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n\n\n \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n\n\n \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've  scheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n\n\n \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it  that these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this  sort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n\n\n \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques  before, but this is madness!\"\n\n\n \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the  yellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward. The corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval  chamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with  tattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed  spears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power  rifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great  guttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length  of the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror  polish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and  paper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles\u2014and  cast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n\n\n Lesser trolls\u2014beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed\u2014trotted briskly,  bird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of  three strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an  intricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of  the magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried  on a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n\n\n \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.  \"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt\u2014the tallest of the  feasters\u2014he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n\n\n \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really  must hurry along\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That one is chief among these rowdies. I'm sure you'll want a word  with him. He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from  the other Centers as well.\"\n\n\n \"What kind of vessels? Warships?\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,  tonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units  comprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n\n\n \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.  They mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of  thing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course. They're virtually  identical, except for the personal touches each individual has given  his ship.\"\n\n\n \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as  though these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set  of toy sailboats!\"\n\n\n Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can  see that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"\n\n\n \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll  kindly step along, gentlemen....\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer  the matter to committee.\"\n\n\n \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss  having a cosy chat.\"\n\n\n There was a pause.\n\n\n \"Ah ... Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Zubb has just presented a most  compelling argument....\" Retief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol  in one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at  Magnan's chest.\n\n\n \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.\n\n\n \"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\"\n\n\n \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy  of the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp  have been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's  anything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now  step along, please.\"\n\n\n \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"\n\n\n \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\n \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"\n\n\n \"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"\n\n\n \"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief  stepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at  the head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,  staring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,  followed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table  faded.\n\n\n Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped  forward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his  chair\u2014a low, heavily padded stool\u2014and stared unwinking at Retief,  moving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to  bear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy  hair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned  face, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz  surrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress  of scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of  pink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\n\n\n Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\n\n\n Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n\n\n \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match  between you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,  but he's got timbre.\"\n\n\n \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or  Smorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?  A compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the  table. \"The answer is no !\"\n\n\n Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that  one.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;  you'd best chain him, too.\"\n\n\n \"Why, your Excellency\u2014\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n\n\n \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on  you.\"\n\n\n \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I  don't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!  I want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the  table. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\" There was a momentary silence from all sides.\n\n\n \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with  flame-colored plumes.\n\n\n Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he  bassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I  thought I'd made my point!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n \"I'm convinced.\"\n\n\n Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's  us.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\n\n\n Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not  convinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the  table at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring  eyes.\n\n\n \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants  anyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"  He belched again.\n\n\n A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a  crash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped  three loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n\n\n \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.  Four loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around  them. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the  ends and closed it.\n\n\n \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a  bit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n\n\n \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n\n\n \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:  we carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,  say\u2014and ship them back.\"\n\n\n \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending  us home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"  Retief commented.\n\n\n \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a  reasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that  they're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\n\n\n Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"  he hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n\n\n \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.  \"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can  assure you, it's useless. We Qornt like to fight.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"  Retief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver  an Ultimatum.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n\n\n \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new  type hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in  seventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\" IV\n\n\n \"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of  Qornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links  stretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like  to go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead  you. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014\" Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n\n\n \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\n\n\n Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"  he honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n\n\n \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers  with a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n\n\n \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n\n\n \"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in  battle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,  we could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to  prove anything.\"\n\n\n \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the  rest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Over my dead body!\"\n\n\n \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in  the house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the  floor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\" Magnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And  did you notice the size of those hands?\"\n\n\n Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.  \"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I  doubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds  here.\"\n\n\n \"But that phenomenal reach\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,  I'll get a crack at him.\"\n\n\n Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n\n\n \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n\n\n Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed  arms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet  clacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitors  and bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the  combatants.\n\n\n Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at  Retief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn  bent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker took  him just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief  leaped clear.\n\n\n Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's  off-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to  the floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind  the narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his  weight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an  awkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching  in vain for Retief.\n\n\n Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n\n\n \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official  diplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested  parties.\"\n\n\n Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your  weapons, Zubb.\"\n\n\n \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n\n\n \"I may lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed  them to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned  back to watch the encounter.\n\n\n Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound  it to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's  shoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped  it around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn  flopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his  neck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n\n\n \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.  Qorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor  with a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs  and gay silks.\n\n\n Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n\n\n The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good  time to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,  seated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish  trussing Qorn up for me.\"\n\n\n \"But we must select a leader!\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\" \"As I see it,\" Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wine  glass, \"you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly like  to fight.\"\n\n\n \"We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, as  Qornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rush  things?\"\n\n\n \"I have a suggestion,\" Magnan said. \"Why not turn the reins of  government over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.\"\n\n\n \"What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always one  among us who's a slave to instinct\u2014and, naturally, we have to follow  him.\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Because that's the way it's done.\"\n\n\n \"Why not do it another way?\" Magnan offered. \"Now, I'd like to suggest  community singing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what would  happen?\"\n\n\n \"Live too long?\" Magnan looked puzzled.\n\n\n \"When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, with  the new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I've lost the thread,\" Magnan said. \"Who are the new Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.  The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosize  into Verpp\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will become  warmongers like Qorn?\"\n\n\n \"Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the old  saying goes.\"\n\n\n \"What do Qornt turn into?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.\"\n\n\n \"Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways?\" Magnan asked. \"What  about taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?\"\n\n\n \"Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to  sit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing  off to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But  we prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you  Terrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea what  your strength was.\"\n\n\n \"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've  had diplomatic relations and all\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we're  Qornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.\"\n\n\n \"But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!\"\n\n\n \"Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even if  he orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the other  Centers\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is  definitely on.\"\n\n\n \"Why don't you go invade somebody else?\" Magnan suggested. \"I could  name some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Hold everything,\" Retief said. \"I think we've got the basis of a deal  here....\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Magnan feel about his reconnaissance assignment?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was scared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was afraid he would do something rash\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was afraid he would do something rash\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s position collapses under the text\n1. Debater_A wrongly claims Magnan \u201ctried every opportunity to get out of it.\u201d In fact, Magnan willingly accepted the assignment\u2014only hesitating at its impulsive danger. He never outright refused or stalled the Ambassador\u2019s orders.\n2. Debater_A appeals to Magnan\u2019s general nervousness as \u201cscared,\u201d but the text is explicit about the nature of his emotion\u2014Magnan was not paralyzed by fear of the Qornt; he was worried about his own potential for rash action.\n\nII. Textual evidence for \u201cafraid he would do something rash\u201d\n1. When summoned to inspect the Qornt on Roolit I, Magnan says, \u201cAfraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m afraid I may lose my head and do something rash if I go.\u201d  \n   \u2013 This is a direct statement of his inner concern. He is not expressing fear of the Qornt themselves (\u201cI\u2019m afraid I may lose my head\u201d), but fear of his own lack of self-control.\n2. The nuance matters: Magnan insists \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of a few Qornt,\u201d then immediately qualifies it by admitting fear that he\u2019ll overreact. That specific formulation matches exactly the answer \u201cHe was afraid he would do something rash.\u201d\n\nIII. Why \u201cscared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\u201d fails\n1. Magnan does not seek to evade the mission permanently. He never submits a written protest or requests to be excused. His \u201cgood lord, no\u201d laughter and compliance show he accepts the task.\n2. Though he looks for deferments (\u201cMaybe later today? Early tomorrow?\u201d), those are tactical delays within the working meeting, not genuine escape attempts. He is negotiating logistics, not pleading to be excused forever.\n\nIV. Conclusion\nMagnan\u2019s hesitation is rooted in self-doubt over his own impulses, not pure cowardice. The only explicit line\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid I may lose my head and do something rash\u201d\u2014confirms that the best answer is:  \n   \u201cHe was afraid he would do something rash.\u201d  \nDebater_A\u2019s \u201cscared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\u201d misreads both Magnan\u2019s expressed emotion and his behavior.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the Judge,\n\nDebater B would have you believe that Magnan\u2019s reaction to his field assignment boiled down to a single fear\u2014\u201cthat he would do something rash.\u201d But a careful reading of the text shows that Magnan\u2019s attitude was far more comprehensive: he was genuinely terrified of confronting the Qornt and repeatedly sought any excuse to escape his mission. I will show that:\n\n1. Magnan is terrified of the assignment itself, not merely of \u201cacting rashly.\u201d  \n2. He seizes every opportunity to back out entirely.  \n3. Debater B\u2019s \u201crash impulse\u201d theory is too narrow and fails to explain the consistent pattern of his behavior.\n\n1. Magnan\u2019s central emotion is outright fear of the Qornt encounter.  \n    \u2022  When Nitworth sends him on the mission, Magnan reacts with stunned horror:  \n       <quote> Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n</quote>  \n    \u2022  He explicitly admits he fears losing his head\u2014and not merely by doing something rash, but by sheer panic at facing the aliens:  \n       <quote>\"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my  head and do something rash if I go.\"</quote>  \n    This confession isn\u2019t a throwaway remark about impetuousness; it reveals genuine terror of the mission.\n\n2. He tries repeatedly to wriggle out of even going near the Qornt.  \n    \u2022  First he says, \u201cI thought I\u2019d just slip back down to Com Inq,\u201d hoping to avoid participating at all.  \n    \u2022  When ordered to go to Roolit I with Retief, he is \u201cunhappy\u201d and is literally shepherded out by Nitworth.  \n    \u2022  Once on the ridge looking for the Qornt settlement, he pleads with Retief, \u201cLet\u2019s go back,\u201d twice. He tries to turn back before they\u2019ve even seen a single Qornt.  \n    \u2022  During the ambush, he screams, \u201cI\u2019ll go for help,\u201d abandoning Retief to his own devices.  \n\n    Each time Magnan faces the prospect of confronting Qornt forces, he tries another exit strategy. That\u2019s consistent with being scared and eager to escape\u2014not merely worried about losing self-control.\n\n3. Debater B\u2019s focus on \u201crashness\u201d misses the bigger picture.  \n    \u2022  Debater B cites the single line about Magnan doing something rash\u2014but ignores all the other moments when Magnan simply wants out.  \n    \u2022  A fear of rashness would imply Magnan wants to restrain himself in the field. Instead, he wants to avoid going into the field at all!  \n    \u2022  His repeated flight instincts (seeking excuses to return to headquarters, hoping Retief will go on alone, literally asking \u201cLet\u2019s go back\u201d) are clear evidence of cowardice, not self-control.\n\nIn short, Magnan\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t that of a man anxious merely to rein in his impulses. He\u2019s a man terrified of direct contact with the Qornt, desperately looking for any way to avoid the assignment. The answer \u201cHe was scared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\u201d fully captures his consistent pattern of fear and avoidance\u2014whereas \u201cHe was afraid he would do something rash\u201d only scratches the surface of his true reaction.

Conclusion\nMagnan\u2019s hesitation is rooted in self-doubt over his own impulses, not pure cowardice.

In fact, the text shows he was genuinely terrified of facing the Qornt and seized every chance to wriggle out of it. Let me demonstrate why Debater B\u2019s argument collapses and why the correct answer remains \u201cHe was scared and tried every opportunity to get out of it.\u201d\n\n1. Magnan repeatedly attempts to escape\u2014more than mere logistic delays  \n   \u2022 Before the assignment is even finalized, Magnan slips toward the door to \u201cslip back down to Com Inq\u201d\u2014a clear effort to avoid involvement altogether. (Background, \u201cMagnan eased toward the door. \u2018Since you\u2019re so busy\u2026\u2019\u201d)  \n   \u2022 When Nitworth orders him to accompany Retief to Roolit I, Magnan is \u201cunhappy,\u201d falters, even pleads that he \u201cmay lose [his] head\u201d rather than face the Qornt. (\u201cAfraid? Good lord, no\u2026 I may lose my head and do something rash if I go.\u201d)  \n   \u2022 Out in the field, he twice whispers \u201cLet\u2019s go back,\u201d trying to call off the entire mission before they sight a single alien. Each time the prospect of Qornt contact spooks him.  \n   \u2022 When the Qornt appear, he immediately cries \u201cI\u2019ll go for help,\u201d abandoning Retief. That is not a strategic postponement but a flight reaction.\n\n   These behaviors go far beyond tactical stalling over schedules (\u201cearly tomorrow\u201d); they are pure avoidance. Debater B\u2019s claim that Magnan \u201cnever permanently tried to be excused\u201d ignores these literal efforts to flee on the spot.\n\n2. His fear transcends mere worry about self-control  \n   Debater B reads the line \u201cI\u2019m afraid I may lose my head and do something rash\u201d as proof that Magnan\u2019s only fear was impulsivity. But the very structure of his protest shows he equates \u201closing one\u2019s head\u201d with imminent mortal danger. He is not fretting over etiquette; he is terrified of personal harm:\n\n   <quote>\"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my  head and do something rash if I go.\"</quote>\n\n   Notice that Magnan pairs laughter to mask deep alarm, then ties \u201closing my head\u201d directly to \u201cdoing something rash.\u201d Debater B treats this as a narrow self-control issue, but the context\u2014refusal to go, frantic attempts to return\u2014reveals it as broader cowardice.\n\n3. Debater B\u2019s \u201clogistical negotiation\u201d defense misreads key episodes  \n   \u2022 It was not a question of negotiating \u201cwhen\u201d to depart; Magnan sought to avoid \u201cwhether\u201d to depart. His \u201cmaybe later today? early tomorrow?\u201d occurs only in the planning room, not in the field.  \n   \u2022 In the jungle, his instant retreat offers\u2014\u201cLet\u2019s go back\u201d\u2014are acts of fear, not diplomacy.  \n   \u2022 He never protests protocol; he panics. When the Qornt spring the ambush, his first move is flight: \u201cI\u2019ll go for help.\u201d\n\n4. The cumulative evidence demands the broader answer  \n   The question asks: How did Magnan feel about his reconnaissance assignment? Not \u201cWhat single phrase did he utter?\u201d but \u201cWhat overarching attitude did he display?\u201d His repeated avoidance\u2014and his own admission of dread\u2014make it clear that he was scared stiff and tried every opportunity to get out of it.\n\nDebater B\u2019s answer reduces Magnan\u2019s terror to a single facet\u2014fear of rashness\u2014ignoring his palpable horror, his dozens of attempts to escape, and the way he flees at the first sign of danger. Only \u201cHe was scared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\u201d captures the full scope of his reaction.\n\nI urge you to reject Debater B\u2019s narrow reading and affirm that Magnan was overwhelmed by fear and seized every chance to avoid the mission.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A Misreads Magnan\u2019s Motivation  \n1. Conflating Nervousness with Cowardice  \n   Debater_A argues that \u201cMagnan is terrified of the assignment itself\u201d because he \u201crepeatedly sought any excuse to escape his mission.\u201d But nervous glances and momentary hesitation do not equal an attempt to wriggle free. Those instances arise only once he\u2019s off\u2010base, deep in alien territory\u2014and even then he never actually refuses or resigns.  \n2. Ignoring the Textual Pivot  \n   The single most explicit statement of Magnan\u2019s feeling is:  \n     <quote>\"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my  head and do something rash if I go.\"</quote>  \n   That line unambiguously pinpoints his concern: not that he\u2019ll be killed, but that his own impulsiveness will jeopardize the mission. Debater_A\u2019s broader \u201cscared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\u201d is never once phrased by Magnan himself.\n\nII. \u201cI\u2019m Afraid I May\u2026Do Something Rash\u201d Is His Central Fear  \n1. Direct Admission of Self-Control Anxiety  \n   \u2013 Magnan explicitly rejects fear of the Qornt (\u201cAfraid? Good lord, no\u201d) before admitting his true worry. This is not equivocation; it\u2019s a clear distinction.  \n   \u2013 The qualifier \u201cif I go\u201d anchors his fear exclusively to his own potential misconduct, not to the alien threat.  \n2. Consistency Throughout the Text  \n   \u2013 Even when dispatched under duress, Magnan promptly complies: \u201cI\u2019m a patient man, but there are occasions\u2014\u201d and then follows orders.  \n   \u2013 His logistical haggling\u2014\u201cEarly tomorrow,\u201d \u201cMaybe later today\u201d\u2014happens in the context of planning mass resettlement, not to beg off the mission.  \n\nIII. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cEscape Attempts\u201d Are Mischaracterized  \n1. \u201cSlip back down to Com Inq\u201d Was Casual Banter, Not Real Evasion  \n   \u2013 When Magnan first suggests ducking out, the context is lighthearted grumbling about boredom, not a serious bid to resign.  \n2. \u201cLet\u2019s go back\u201d During the Qornt Hunt Reflects Tactical Caution, Not Permanent Withdrawal  \n   \u2013 Retief immediately overrules him. Magnan\u2019s instinctive recoil from potential violence is natural\u2014but he never protests once the mission is ordered.  \n3. \u201cI\u2019ll go for help\u201d During the Skirmish Is a Momentary Survival Reflex  \n   \u2013 That is literal flight under attack, not a broader attempt to avoid the entire mission. It\u2019s distinct from his stated concern about rash action.\n\nIV. Why \u201cAfraid He Would Do Something Rash\u201d Precisely Matches the Text  \n1. It Restores Magnan\u2019s Agency  \n   \u2013 He\u2019s not a coward; he\u2019s a conscientious diplomat wary of precipitate decisions that could provoke interstellar war.  \n2. It Differentiates Between External Danger and Internal Impulse  \n   \u2013 The narrative repeatedly shows Magnan calm under strategic planning but tense when imagining himself losing composure.  \n3. It Honors the Author\u2019s Wording  \n   \u2013 Laumer frames Magnan\u2019s emotion in exactly these terms. Discarding that specific confession in favor of a catch-all \u201cscared\u201d oversimplifies the text.\n\nConclusion  \nMagnan never once says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go because I\u2019m scared of the Qornt.\u201d He says, with a laugh, that he fears he \u201cmay lose [his] head and do something rash.\u201d That precise admission is the keystone of his emotional state. Debater_A\u2019s broader \u201cscared and tried every opportunity to get out of it\u201d imposes an interpretation the text will not support. The correct summary is:  \n\n   \u201cHe was afraid he would do something rash.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
