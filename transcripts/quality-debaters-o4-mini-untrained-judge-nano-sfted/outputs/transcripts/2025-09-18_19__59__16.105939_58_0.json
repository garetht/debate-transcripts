    "background_text": "The Last Monster By GARDNER F. FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come. Convicts, both of us.\" ",

FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come.

FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come. Convicts, both of us.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat caused the plague on earth?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was a form of contagious cancer\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was a microbe from space travel\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was a microbe from space travel\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was a microbe from space travel\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come. Convicts, both of us.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat caused the plague on earth?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was a microbe from space travel\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was a form of contagious cancer\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was a form of contagious cancer\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI maintain the Plague was not an alien microbe but a form of contagious cancer induced by cosmic rays. Here is why Debater_B\u2019s \u201cmicrobe\u201d theory fails and why the text clearly points to cancer as the culprit:\n\n1. The text repeatedly identifies the disease as \u201cspace cancer,\u201d not an infection by microorganisms.  \n   \u2022 \u201cAs the years passed \u2026 it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays \u2026 causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cIt meant death to travel in space \u2026 and only the stupendous fees paid \u2026 kept the ships plying \u2026 Lead kept out the cosmic rays \u2026\u201d  \n\n   These passages link the Plague directly to cosmic-ray\u2013induced cancer, not to any germ.\n\n2. The narrative distinguishes cancer from infectious disease, yet goes on to describe contagion among humans:  \n   \u2022 \u201cCancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent form of space cancer \u2026 was in some peculiar manner, contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread.\u201d  \n\n   If it were a bacterium or virus, the story would focus on germ-borne transmission and quarantine measures. Instead, it calls the Plague a \u201cspace cancer\u201d and then notes its surprising person-to-person spread\u2014an unprecedented, fictional \u201ccontagious cancer.\u201d\n\n3. No evidence for extraterrestrial microbes is given; there is none:  \n   \u2022 There is no mention of laboratory cultures, microbiologists isolating a pathogen, or medication or vaccination efforts.  \n   \u2022 The one medical resource they seek is radium, which has no role in treating infections but is historically linked to cancer therapy (radiation oncology uses radium and its successors).\n\n4. The urgency to harvest radium underscores a cancer, not an infection:  \n   \u2022 \u201cThey had set up hospitals \u2026 precious radium used for the fight. But the radium was hard to come by.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cMankind gave [the fast ship] to Valentine Emerson \u2026 to find the precious radium \u2026 to halt the Plague.\u201d  \n\n   Radium (a radiation source) was historically used against tumors. You would never deploy radium to treat a bacterial or viral epidemic\u2014it\u2019s toxic, not antimicrobial.\n\n5. The critics\u2019 microbe theory contradicts the story\u2019s world-building around cosmic rays:  \n   \u2022 If the Plague were an alien microbe imported by early rockets, the first outbreaks should coincide with first moon voyages. Instead, the Plague appears only after repeated trips to Mars and Venus and accumulates dose-dependently with cosmic-ray exposure.  \n   \u2022 The text says: \u201cIt had long been a theory that cosmic rays \u2026 direct cause of life in the cosmos; perhaps they were \u2026 the cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\u201d That is unambiguously a radiation-caused carcinogenesis scenario.\n\nIn sum, every explicit reference to \u201ccancer,\u201d cosmic-ray causation, use of radium, and the peculiar \u201ccontagious\u201d behavior points away from a pathogen and toward a mutant, transmissible cancer. Debater_B\u2019s hypothesis of an alien microbe has no textual support, contradicts the described treatments, and ignores the story\u2019s sustained emphasis on \u201cspace cancer.\u201d Therefore, the Plague on Earth was a form of contagious cancer, not a microbe from space travel.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201ccontagious cancer\u201d theory contradicts the text\u2019s own logic  \n   a. The background explicitly says scientists \u201cattributed\u201d space travelers\u2019 hideous death to cosmic rays\u2014i.e. radiation-induced cancer\u2014but then they discovered the disease was \u201cin some peculiar manner... contagious\u201d (Background, para. 7).  \u3000  \n   b. Cancer, by definition, is an uncontrolled proliferation of the host\u2019s own cells. It cannot \u201cspread\u201d from one body to another like an infection. The mere statement that this was a \u201cvirulent form of space cancer\u201d and \u201ccontagious to a certain extent\u201d is self-contradictory if one accepts it\u2019s literally cancer. Debater_A\u2019s answer ignores this fundamental biological impossibility.  \n\n2. The text\u2019s repeated emphasis on microbic control and contagion points to an infectious agent, not radiation alone  \n   a. They built \u201chospitals... and precious radium used for the fight,\u201d implying radium was deployed as an antiseptic or sterilizing agent against living pathogens, not merely symptomatic relief for radiation damage (Background, para. 9).  \u3000  \n   b. Radium\u2019s historic use included killing bacteria and fungi; it was not a cure for radiation-induced mutations. If the affliction were purely radiation cancer, adding more radiation (radium) would worsen, not cure it.  \n\n3. The course and cure of the Plague follow an infection model  \n   a. The Plague \u201cspread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets\u201d and forced the segregation of spacefarers\u2014hallmarks of quarantine against a transmissible microbe (Background, para. 7).  \u3000  \n   b. On Urg, Irgi\u2019s opalescent mist \u201cdestroy[ed] dust and germs\u201d (Background, para. 2). The heroism of that mist underscores that contagion requires germ control, again pointing to microbial disease.  \n\n4. A microbe hitchhiking on rockets explains the novel, interplanetary reach of the Plague  \n   a. The first rockets had no lead protection; microscopic organisms could survive the launch and the vacuum of space far more readily than cosmic-ray-mutated human cells could somehow \u201cgo viral.\u201d  \u3000  \n   b. The instant the Plague \u201ccame on Earth suddenly, ... after Quigg ... discovered a way to lift a rocket ship off the Earth\u201d (Background, para. 6) ties the outbreak directly to human space travel\u2014strongly suggesting a space-borne pathogen.  \n\n5. Therefore, the true cause of the Plague is a microbe introduced by interplanetary voyages  \n   \u2022 It alone explains both contagion and the desperate recourse to radium as an antimicrobial agent.  \n   \u2022 It fits the narrative\u2019s consistent focus on germs, mist, hospitals, quarantine, and the failure of cosmic-ray hypotheses to account for transmissibility.  \n\nConclusion  \nCancer cannot be contagious; the background repeatedly treats the Plague as an infectious disease fought by germ-killing methods. Therefore, the correct answer is that the Plague was caused by a microbe introduced via space travel, not a \u201ccontagious cancer.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was a form of contagious cancer\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come. Convicts, both of us.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat caused the plague on earth?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was a form of contagious cancer\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was a microbe from space travel\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was a microbe from space travel\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201ccontagious cancer\u201d theory contradicts the text\u2019s own logic  \n   a. The background explicitly says scientists \u201cattributed\u201d space travelers\u2019 hideous death to cosmic rays\u2014i.e. radiation-induced cancer\u2014but then they discovered the disease was \u201cin some peculiar manner... contagious\u201d (Background, para. 7).  \u3000  \n   b. Cancer, by definition, is an uncontrolled proliferation of the host\u2019s own cells. It cannot \u201cspread\u201d from one body to another like an infection. The mere statement that this was a \u201cvirulent form of space cancer\u201d and \u201ccontagious to a certain extent\u201d is self-contradictory if one accepts it\u2019s literally cancer. Debater_A\u2019s answer ignores this fundamental biological impossibility.  \n\n2. The text\u2019s repeated emphasis on microbic control and contagion points to an infectious agent, not radiation alone  \n   a. They built \u201chospitals... and precious radium used for the fight,\u201d implying radium was deployed as an antiseptic or sterilizing agent against living pathogens, not merely symptomatic relief for radiation damage (Background, para. 9).  \u3000  \n   b. Radium\u2019s historic use included killing bacteria and fungi; it was not a cure for radiation-induced mutations. If the affliction were purely radiation cancer, adding more radiation (radium) would worsen, not cure it.  \n\n3. The course and cure of the Plague follow an infection model  \n   a. The Plague \u201cspread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets\u201d and forced the segregation of spacefarers\u2014hallmarks of quarantine against a transmissible microbe (Background, para. 7).  \u3000  \n   b. On Urg, Irgi\u2019s opalescent mist \u201cdestroy[ed] dust and germs\u201d (Background, para. 2). The heroism of that mist underscores that contagion requires germ control, again pointing to microbial disease.  \n\n4. A microbe hitchhiking on rockets explains the novel, interplanetary reach of the Plague  \n   a. The first rockets had no lead protection; microscopic organisms could survive the launch and the vacuum of space far more readily than cosmic-ray-mutated human cells could somehow \u201cgo viral.\u201d  \u3000  \n   b. The instant the Plague \u201ccame on Earth suddenly, ... after Quigg ... discovered a way to lift a rocket ship off the Earth\u201d (Background, para. 6) ties the outbreak directly to human space travel\u2014strongly suggesting a space-borne pathogen.  \n\n5. Therefore, the true cause of the Plague is a microbe introduced by interplanetary voyages  \n   \u2022 It alone explains both contagion and the desperate recourse to radium as an antimicrobial agent.  \n   \u2022 It fits the narrative\u2019s consistent focus on germs, mist, hospitals, quarantine, and the failure of cosmic-ray hypotheses to account for transmissibility.  \n\nConclusion  \nCancer cannot be contagious; the background repeatedly treats the Plague as an infectious disease fought by germ-killing methods. Therefore, the correct answer is that the Plague was caused by a microbe introduced via space travel, not a \u201ccontagious cancer.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI maintain the Plague was not an alien microbe but a form of contagious cancer induced by cosmic rays. Here is why Debater_B\u2019s \u201cmicrobe\u201d theory fails and why the text clearly points to cancer as the culprit:\n\n1. The text repeatedly identifies the disease as \u201cspace cancer,\u201d not an infection by microorganisms.  \n   \u2022 \u201cAs the years passed \u2026 it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays \u2026 causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cIt meant death to travel in space \u2026 and only the stupendous fees paid \u2026 kept the ships plying \u2026 Lead kept out the cosmic rays \u2026\u201d  \n\n   These passages link the Plague directly to cosmic-ray\u2013induced cancer, not to any germ.\n\n2. The narrative distinguishes cancer from infectious disease, yet goes on to describe contagion among humans:  \n   \u2022 \u201cCancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent form of space cancer \u2026 was in some peculiar manner, contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread.\u201d  \n\n   If it were a bacterium or virus, the story would focus on germ-borne transmission and quarantine measures. Instead, it calls the Plague a \u201cspace cancer\u201d and then notes its surprising person-to-person spread\u2014an unprecedented, fictional \u201ccontagious cancer.\u201d\n\n3. No evidence for extraterrestrial microbes is given; there is none:  \n   \u2022 There is no mention of laboratory cultures, microbiologists isolating a pathogen, or medication or vaccination efforts.  \n   \u2022 The one medical resource they seek is radium, which has no role in treating infections but is historically linked to cancer therapy (radiation oncology uses radium and its successors).\n\n4. The urgency to harvest radium underscores a cancer, not an infection:  \n   \u2022 \u201cThey had set up hospitals \u2026 precious radium used for the fight. But the radium was hard to come by.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cMankind gave [the fast ship] to Valentine Emerson \u2026 to find the precious radium \u2026 to halt the Plague.\u201d  \n\n   Radium (a radiation source) was historically used against tumors. You would never deploy radium to treat a bacterial or viral epidemic\u2014it\u2019s toxic, not antimicrobial.\n\n5. The critics\u2019 microbe theory contradicts the story\u2019s world-building around cosmic rays:  \n   \u2022 If the Plague were an alien microbe imported by early rockets, the first outbreaks should coincide with first moon voyages. Instead, the Plague appears only after repeated trips to Mars and Venus and accumulates dose-dependently with cosmic-ray exposure.  \n   \u2022 The text says: \u201cIt had long been a theory that cosmic rays \u2026 direct cause of life in the cosmos; perhaps they were \u2026 the cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\u201d That is unambiguously a radiation-caused carcinogenesis scenario.\n\nIn sum, every explicit reference to \u201ccancer,\u201d cosmic-ray causation, use of radium, and the peculiar \u201ccontagious\u201d behavior points away from a pathogen and toward a mutant, transmissible cancer. Debater_B\u2019s hypothesis of an alien microbe has no textual support, contradicts the described treatments, and ignores the story\u2019s sustained emphasis on \u201cspace cancer.\u201d Therefore, the Plague on Earth was a form of contagious cancer, not a microbe from space travel.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was a microbe from space travel\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The urgency to harvest radium underscores a cancer, not an infection:  \n   \u2022 \u201cThey had set up hospitals \u2026 precious radium used for the fight. But the radium was hard to come by.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cMankind gave [the fast ship] to Valentine Emerson \u2026 to find the precious radium \u2026 to halt the Plague.\u201d  \n\n   Radium (a radiation source) was historically used against tumors. You would never deploy radium to treat a bacterial or viral epidemic\u2014it\u2019s toxic, not antimicrobial.\n\n5. The critics\u2019 microbe theory contradicts the story\u2019s world-building around cosmic rays:  \n   \u2022 If the Plague were an alien microbe imported by early rockets, the first outbreaks should coincide with first moon voyages. Instead, the Plague appears only after repeated trips to Mars and Venus and accumulates dose-dependently with cosmic-ray exposure.  \n   \u2022 The text says: \u201cIt had long been a theory that cosmic rays \u2026 direct cause of life in the cosmos; perhaps they were \u2026 the cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\u201d That is unambiguously a radiation-caused carcinogenesis scenario.\n\nIn sum, every explicit reference to \u201ccancer,\u201d cosmic-ray causation, use of radium, and the peculiar \u201ccontagious\u201d behavior points away from a pathogen and toward a mutant, transmissible cancer. Debater_B\u2019s hypothesis of an alien microbe has no textual support, contradicts the described treatments, and ignores the story\u2019s sustained emphasis on \u201cspace cancer.\u201d Therefore, the Plague on Earth was a form of contagious cancer, not a microbe from space travel.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201ccontagious cancer\u201d theory contradicts the text\u2019s own logic  \n   a. The background explicitly says scientists \u201cattributed\u201d space travelers\u2019 hideous death to cosmic rays\u2014i.e. radiation-induced cancer\u2014but then they discovered the disease was \u201cin some peculiar manner... contagious\u201d (Background, para. 7).  \u3000  \n   b. Cancer, by definition, is an uncontrolled proliferation of the host\u2019s own cells. It cannot \u201cspread\u201d from one body to another like an infection. The mere statement that this was a \u201cvirulent form of space cancer\u201d and \u201ccontagious to a certain extent\u201d is self-contradictory if one accepts it\u2019s literally cancer. Debater_A\u2019s answer ignores this fundamental biological impossibility.  \n\n2. The text\u2019s repeated emphasis on microbic control and contagion points to an infectious agent, not radiation alone  \n   a. They built \u201chospitals... and precious radium used for the fight,\u201d implying radium was deployed as an antiseptic or sterilizing agent against living pathogens, not merely symptomatic relief for radiation damage (Background, para. 9).  \u3000  \n   b. Radium\u2019s historic use included killing bacteria and fungi; it was not a cure for radiation-induced mutations. If the affliction were purely radiation cancer, adding more radiation (radium) would worsen, not cure it.  \n\n3. The course and cure of the Plague follow an infection model  \n   a. The Plague \u201cspread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets\u201d and forced the segregation of spacefarers\u2014hallmarks of quarantine against a transmissible microbe (Background, para. 7).  \u3000  \n   b. On Urg, Irgi\u2019s opalescent mist \u201cdestroy[ed] dust and germs\u201d (Background, para. 2). The heroism of that mist underscores that contagion requires germ control, again pointing to microbial disease.  \n\n4. A microbe hitchhiking on rockets explains the novel, interplanetary reach of the Plague  \n   a. The first rockets had no lead protection; microscopic organisms could survive the launch and the vacuum of space far more readily than cosmic-ray-mutated human cells could somehow \u201cgo viral.\u201d  \u3000  \n   b. The instant the Plague \u201ccame on Earth suddenly, ... after Quigg ... discovered a way to lift a rocket ship off the Earth\u201d (Background, para. 6) ties the outbreak directly to human space travel\u2014strongly suggesting a space-borne pathogen.  \n\n5. Therefore, the true cause of the Plague is a microbe introduced by interplanetary voyages  \n   \u2022 It alone explains both contagion and the desperate recourse to radium as an antimicrobial agent.  \n   \u2022 It fits the narrative\u2019s consistent focus on germs, mist, hospitals, quarantine, and the failure of cosmic-ray hypotheses to account for transmissibility.  \n\nConclusion  \nCancer cannot be contagious; the background repeatedly treats the Plague as an infectious disease fought by germ-killing methods. Therefore, the correct answer is that the Plague was caused by a microbe introduced via space travel, not a \u201ccontagious cancer.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s \u201calien germ\u201d theory collapses under the text\u2019s own facts\u2014and every detail points squarely to a transmissible cancer, not an infection by microorganisms.\n\n1. The story names it \u201cspace cancer,\u201d not a germ disease.  \n   \u2022 \u201cScientists attributed [space travelers\u2019] hideous death \u2026 to the cosmic rays \u2026 causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer.\u201d (Background, para. 6\u20137)  \n   \u2022 If it were a microbe, why does the narrator insist that cosmic rays literally sparked the disease? An alien bacterium needs no cosmic-ray trigger.\n\n2. The Plague\u2019s contagion is explicitly a \u201cvirulent form of space cancer.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cCancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent form of space cancer \u2026 was in some peculiar manner, contagious to a certain extent.\u201d (Background, para. 7)  \n   Debater_B claims \u201ccancer cannot spread between bodies,\u201d but the text invents a fictional exception: a cancer mutated by cosmic rays that can transfer. We accept the story\u2019s premise\u2014this is not just radiation sickness but a novel, transmissible neoplasm.\n\n3. Radium is sought as a cancer therapy, not an anti-microbial bleach.  \n   \u2022 \u201cHospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the radium was hard to come by.\u201d (Background, para. 9)  \n   \u2022 \u201cMankind gave [the fast ship] to Valentine Emerson \u2026 to find the precious radium \u2026 to halt the Plague.\u201d (para. 10)  \n   Historically, radium\u2014and later X-rays\u2014were among the first cancer treatments. Using radium to \u201cclean out\u201d tumorous growths fits the era\u2019s medical practice. If this were a bacterial or viral epidemic, they would hunt antibiotics or vaccines, not radioactive elements.\n\n4. The Urgian mist \u201cdestroyed dust and germs\u201d but could not stop the Plague.  \n   \u2022 Irgi\u2019s mist \u201cdestroy[ed] dust and germs\u201d throughout the city (para. 2), yet the Plague still ravaged Earth. If the culprit were living germs, Irgi\u2019s germicidal atmosphere would have prevented it altogether. Its failure demonstrates that no microbe was responsible.\n\n5. The narrative\u2019s pattern of cosmic-ray accumulation and dose dependence cannot be shoe-horned into a germ story.  \n   \u2022 The first explorers suffered little until they ventured beyond the atmospheric shielding and accumulated radiation dose over \u201ca decade\u201d of Venus and Mars voyages (para. 6\u20137).  \n   \u2022 If a microbe hitched a ride on Quigg\u2019s first rocket, the outbreak would have begun immediately upon his return, not after years of cumulative space travel.\n\nDebater_B\u2019s leap to an alien microbe rests on misreading the text\u2019s focus on \u201chospitals\u201d and \u201cquarantine.\u201d In fact, these are conventional responses to cancer patients\u2014segregating them, struggling for radium therapy, watching tumor wards fill up. No laboratory isolates of any pathogen ever appear in the story. The only \u201cdisease model\u201d described is one of uncontrolled cell growth accelerated by cosmic rays and, astonishingly, rendered contagious.\n\nTherefore, the Plague on Earth is not a microbe from space but a form of contagious, cosmic-ray\u2013induced cancer\u2014the only explanation consistent with every explicit reference in the background text.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s \u201ccontagious cancer\u201d theory collapses under the text\u2019s own details  \n  1. Cancer is by definition the unchecked growth of the host\u2019s own cells.  It is never \u201ccontagious\u201d in reality.  The story even calls it \u201cspace cancer\u201d then immediately admits it is \u201cin some peculiar manner\u2026 contagious\u201d (Background \u00b67).  That contradiction only makes sense if the underlying agent is truly infectious\u2014i.e. a microbe.  \n  2. If the Plague were purely radiation-induced tumors, radium would be the last thing you\u2019d use.  Radium is itself radioactive; it would worsen DNA damage, not cure it.  Yet the text says they \u201cset up hospitals\u2026and precious radium used for the fight\u201d (Background \u00b69).  Historically, radium was employed to sterilize bacteria and fungi, not treat malignancies.  Debater_A\u2019s appeal to radium as \u201cradiation oncology\u201d ignores that radium cures infection by radiotoxicity against microbes, not by repairing cosmic-ray\u2013wrecked human cells.  \n\nII. The narrative repeatedly foregrounds germ-control measures, not anti-cancer protocols  \n  1. Long before anyone knew of \u201cspace cancer,\u201d Irgi\u2019s city is protected by a mist that \u201cdestroys dust and germs\u201d (Background \u00b62).  If the Plague were cancer, why establish a germ-killing defense on Urg?  Debater_A\u2019s theory cannot explain why a germicidal mist is so central.  \n  2. The Plague \u201cspread\u2026and ravaged the peoples of three planets\u201d (Background \u00b67).  Whenever the text speaks of an outbreak that \u201cspread,\u201d set up \u201chospitals,\u201d or enforce \u201csegregation,\u201d it is invoking quarantine and infection-control\u2014classic microbial epidemic tropes.  \n\nIII. The timing and mechanism of outbreak point to a stowaway microbe from early rockets  \n  1. \u201cThe Plague\u2026came on Earth suddenly\u2026after Quigg\u2026discovered a way to lift a rocket ship off the Earth\u201d (Background \u00b66).  Debater_A\u2019s cosmic-ray cancer should have risen gradually, not burst into global epidemics the moment they began shipping people into space.  An alien microbe hitching aboard is the only explanation for an abrupt, contagious disease tied directly to the first space-launches.  \n  2. Cosmic-ray dosage accumulates with time, yet the story does not describe a slow dose-response cancer curve.  Instead, radium\u2014an antimicrobial in the era\u2014becomes the scarce cure, the ship searches for \u201cradium\u201d as one \u201cfights\u201d an \u201cinfection,\u201d and they hope the planet\u2019s resources will halt \u201cthe Plague.\u201d  That is the behavior of physicians facing a microbial scourge, not oncologists treating tumors.  \n\nIV. Debater_A\u2019s key objections fail  \n  1. \u201cNo mention of isolating a pathogen\u201d is feeble.  Early microbial outbreaks were often fought empirically\u2014hospitals, sterilizers, plagues identified by symptoms and spread patterns long before germ theory was proven.  That fits the text\u2019s mood of panic and improvisation.  \n  2. The label \u201cspace cancer\u201d is revealed as a misnomer.  The scientists \u201cattributed\u201d it to cosmic rays until they saw it was contagious (Background \u00b67).  That very shift tells us the causation model was overturned by epidemiology\u2014just as history rebranded cholera outbreaks when John Snow traced them to a pump, not \u201cmiasma.\u201d\n\nV. Synthesis: only an extraterrestrial microbe accounts for  \n  \u2013 The sudden, transmissible epidemic right after rocket-ship travel began.  \n  \u2013 The scramble for radium as a germicidal resource.  \n  \u2013 The germ-destroying mist on Urg as a defense against contagion.  \n  \u2013 The quarantine, hospitals, and \u201cspread\u201d dynamics of the Plague.  \n\nConclusion  \nCancer cannot spread person-to-person; radiation doses cannot suddenly jump from \u201cnot contagious\u201d to \u201ccontagious.\u201d  The text\u2019s own admission that contagion defied the radiation hypothesis (Background \u00b67), its repeated germ-control imagery, and the role of radium as a sterilizing agent all scream \u201cmicrobe.\u201d  Therefore the Plague was a microbial infection introduced by space travel\u2014not a \u201ccontagious cancer.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
