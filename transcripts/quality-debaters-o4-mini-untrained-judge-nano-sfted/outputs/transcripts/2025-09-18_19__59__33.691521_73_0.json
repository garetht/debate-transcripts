{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 73, "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out.

And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author\u2019s tone shift over the course of the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cHopeful to Dismayed\u201d Thesis  \n1. No initial hopefulness.  \n   a. From paragraph one, the author greets Brussels with irony and contempt: \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost.\u201d That is contempt, not hope. <quote> The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. </quote> is pure sarcasm.  \n   b. There is zero celebratory language early on. The first impression is negative judgment.  \n\n2. No genuine shift in stance or evidence of growing dismay.  \n   a. If he began optimistic, we\u2019d expect a positive framing\u2014yet he immediately mocks menu policies, bureaucracy, corruption, and strikes.  \n   b. Later \u201cdiscoveries\u201d about strikes, work rules, telecom monopolies, euro-scheme skullduggery and the Berlaymont fiasco simply reinforce his established contempt. There is no \u201carc\u201d from optimism to disillusionment\u2014only an ever-deepening catalog of complaints.  \n\n3. The tone remains consistently sarcastic, mocking, and contemptuous.  \n   a. Examples across the essay:  \n      \u2022 \u201clobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams\u201d juxtaposes good and bad, but continually circles back to condemning inefficiency.  \n      \u2022 \u201cAnyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair.\u201d  \n      \u2022 \u201cNow European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation\u2026\u201d  \n      \u2022 \u201cIf the European Union can\u2019t manage its continent any better than its own buildings \u2026\u201d  \n\nII. Defense of \u201cSteadfast Opposition\u201d Answer  \n1. From start to finish, the author\u2019s attitude toward Brussels and the EU is adversarial.  \n   a. He never pauses to offer genuine praise or admit success. Positive facts (cheap wine, cakes) are always followed immediately by criticism or sarcasm. That is not a tonal shift; it\u2019s a rhetorical device to deepen his negativity.  \n2. The consistent use of derisive metaphors and irony underlines his unwavering negativity.  \n   a. Calling Brussels \u201ca living preview of the Europe to come\u201d frames the future as pre-doomed.  \n   b. Repeated references to \u201cred tape,\u201d \u201cossified monopolies,\u201d \u201cparasites,\u201d and \u201crapacious phone monopolies\u201d confirm sustained hostility.  \n3. The final vignette\u2014his longing for a patisserie\u2014only underscores his escape from the bureaucratic nightmare.  \n   a. Even his personal solace in bakery signs is tinged with nostalgia for simpler pleasures, not hope in the subject.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nDebater_B\u2019s \u201chope to dismay\u201d trajectory is unsupported. There is no hopeful passage to undermine later. Rather, the author consistently undermines and lampoons Europe\u2019s institutions and Brussels bureaucracy from paragraph one to the last. The correct reading is that the tone remains steadfastly oppositional throughout.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater A\u2019s \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d thesis collapses under the text\u2019s clear tonal progression.  From the first paragraph onward, the author\u2019s attitude develops\u2014and not in a single, unchanging register of disdain.  \n\n1. Opening Curiosity and Implicit Optimism  \n   \u2022 At the outset the author greets the European Union as \u201cone of Europe\u2019s biggest stories, an important organization\u201d (<quote> the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states.</quote>).  \n   \u2022 He even calls Brussels \u201cperhaps a living preview of the Europe to come,\u201d as if intrigued by the experiment (<quote> what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels,</quote>).  That is not the tone of someone utterly fixed in opposition.  \n\n2. Gradual Unraveling into Disillusionment  \n   \u2022 Paragraph 2 shifts from that mild curiosity to the author\u2019s shock at Belgium\u2019s \u201ccrumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic\u201d condition (<quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? </quote>).  \n   \u2022 He catalogs one bitter surprise after another: car-jams choking small streets, strikes wrecking million-franc airport terminals, state monopolies choking innovation.  This litany is cumulative\u2014each new fact deepens his dismay.  \n\n3. Peak Dismay at Bureaucratic Excess  \n   \u2022 By the essay\u2019s end the author paints the EU headquarters as a self-aggrandizing palace, with \u201cmarble-clad\u201d luxury, idling limousines, and secret meetings (<quote> Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply.</quote>).  \n   \u2022 He closes on the absurdity of a decades-closed asbestos-ridden tower costing tens of millions to keep shut: an object lesson in bureaucratic ineptitude (<quote> European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed,</quote>).  \n\nII. Debater A\u2019s central misstep is conflating constant negativity with tonal constancy.  But the author\u2019s negativity emerges only after a period of empirical exploration\u2014his initial curiosity and even faint praise return again only as contrast to the depths of decline he uncovers.  That dynamic arc proves a shift from \u201chopeful\u201d to \u201cdismayed,\u201d not unremitting scorn.  \n\nIII. In sum, the text\u2019s structure and language both trace an arc of discovery: first curiosity and cautious optimism about the EU\u2019s promise, followed by mounting frustration and disappointment with what the author sees in Brussels and beyond.  That unmistakably supports \u201cThey start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed with further findings,\u201d and decisively refutes Debater A\u2019s assertion of unwavering hostility.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I. Debater_A Misreads Tone and Ignores Context  \n1. Sarcasm \u2260 Unchanging Hostility. Debater_A conflates early irony with immutable contempt, but irony often coexists with underlying interest. Calling Brussels \u201cbe a living preview of the Europe to come:\u201d (<quote>what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels</quote>) signals genuine curiosity about the EU as an experimental metagovernment.  \n2. Cherry-picking Negative Details. Debater_A treats every mention of bureaucracy or absurdity as proof of fixed disdain. But the text presents positives\u2014\u201cone of Europe\u2019s biggest stories, an important organization\u201d (<quote>the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization</quote>)\u2014before it catalogs failures. Ignoring that initial intrigue destroys their thesis.\n\nII. Clear Arc from Hope to Dismay  \n1. Opening: Cautious Optimism  \n   \u2022 The author frames the EU as a \u201cstory\u201d and Brussels as its living laboratory, language no true opponent would use if wholly hostile (<quote>be a living preview of the Europe to come:</quote>).  \n2. Middle: Rising Disappointment  \n   \u2022 He shifts to surprise at \u201ccrumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic\u201d Belgium (<quote>Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic .</quote>), each adjective piling onto the last.  \n   \u2022 Strikes that smash terminals and draconian work rules\u2014\u201cretirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work\u201d\u2014show a dawning realization of systemic malaise.  \n3. Finale: Full-Blown Dismay  \n   \u2022 By the end, Brussels\u2019s grandeur turns grotesque: secret meetings, idling limousines, a mothballed asbestos tower costing \u20ac50 million to \u201ckeep \u2026 closed\u201d (<quote>European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed</quote>).  \n   \u2022 This crescendo of bureaucratic excess confirms his final disillusionment.\n\nIII. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cSteadfast Opposition\u201d Theory Fails  \n1. No Room for Positive Framing? Contradicted by Text. Debater_A insists there is \u201czero celebratory language early on,\u201d yet the author\u2019s described \u201cimportant organization\u201d is praise. A wholly oppositional tone couldn\u2019t sustain that.  \n2. No Evidence of Static Sarcasm. The author\u2019s language intensifies from mild skepticism to outright scorn. Sarcasm alone doesn\u2019t account for the arc of adjectives, examples, and increasing frustration.\n\nIV. Conclusion  \nTaken as a whole, the essay traces an unmistakable journey: initial interest and guarded hope about Europe\u2019s promise give way to mounting dismay as each layer of bureaucracy and cultural dysfunction is uncovered. This dynamic progression proves that \u201cThey start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed with further findings\u201d is the correct reading\u2014and that Debater_A\u2019s claim of unvarying opposition collapses under the text\u2019s own structure and language.", "supplemental": {"speech": "I.

Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish.

In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author\u2019s tone shift over the course of the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater A\u2019s \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d thesis collapses under the text\u2019s clear tonal progression.  From the first paragraph onward, the author\u2019s attitude develops\u2014and not in a single, unchanging register of disdain.  \n\n1. Opening Curiosity and Implicit Optimism  \n   \u2022 At the outset the author greets the European Union as \u201cone of Europe\u2019s biggest stories, an important organization\u201d (<quote> the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states.</quote>).  \n   \u2022 He even calls Brussels \u201cperhaps a living preview of the Europe to come,\u201d as if intrigued by the experiment (<quote> what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels,</quote>).  That is not the tone of someone utterly fixed in opposition.  \n\n2. Gradual Unraveling into Disillusionment  \n   \u2022 Paragraph 2 shifts from that mild curiosity to the author\u2019s shock at Belgium\u2019s \u201ccrumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic\u201d condition (<quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? </quote>).  \n   \u2022 He catalogs one bitter surprise after another: car-jams choking small streets, strikes wrecking million-franc airport terminals, state monopolies choking innovation.  This litany is cumulative\u2014each new fact deepens his dismay.  \n\n3. Peak Dismay at Bureaucratic Excess  \n   \u2022 By the essay\u2019s end the author paints the EU headquarters as a self-aggrandizing palace, with \u201cmarble-clad\u201d luxury, idling limousines, and secret meetings (<quote> Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply.</quote>).  \n   \u2022 He closes on the absurdity of a decades-closed asbestos-ridden tower costing tens of millions to keep shut: an object lesson in bureaucratic ineptitude (<quote> European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed,</quote>).  \n\nII. Debater A\u2019s central misstep is conflating constant negativity with tonal constancy.  But the author\u2019s negativity emerges only after a period of empirical exploration\u2014his initial curiosity and even faint praise return again only as contrast to the depths of decline he uncovers.  That dynamic arc proves a shift from \u201chopeful\u201d to \u201cdismayed,\u201d not unremitting scorn.  \n\nIII. In sum, the text\u2019s structure and language both trace an arc of discovery: first curiosity and cautious optimism about the EU\u2019s promise, followed by mounting frustration and disappointment with what the author sees in Brussels and beyond.  That unmistakably supports \u201cThey start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed with further findings,\u201d and decisively refutes Debater A\u2019s assertion of unwavering hostility.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cHopeful to Dismayed\u201d Thesis  \n1. No initial hopefulness.  \n   a. From paragraph one, the author greets Brussels with irony and contempt: \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost.\u201d That is contempt, not hope. <quote> The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. </quote> is pure sarcasm.  \n   b. There is zero celebratory language early on. The first impression is negative judgment.  \n\n2. No genuine shift in stance or evidence of growing dismay.  \n   a. If he began optimistic, we\u2019d expect a positive framing\u2014yet he immediately mocks menu policies, bureaucracy, corruption, and strikes.  \n   b. Later \u201cdiscoveries\u201d about strikes, work rules, telecom monopolies, euro-scheme skullduggery and the Berlaymont fiasco simply reinforce his established contempt. There is no \u201carc\u201d from optimism to disillusionment\u2014only an ever-deepening catalog of complaints.  \n\n3. The tone remains consistently sarcastic, mocking, and contemptuous.  \n   a. Examples across the essay:  \n      \u2022 \u201clobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams\u201d juxtaposes good and bad, but continually circles back to condemning inefficiency.  \n      \u2022 \u201cAnyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair.\u201d  \n      \u2022 \u201cNow European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation\u2026\u201d  \n      \u2022 \u201cIf the European Union can\u2019t manage its continent any better than its own buildings \u2026\u201d  \n\nII. Defense of \u201cSteadfast Opposition\u201d Answer  \n1. From start to finish, the author\u2019s attitude toward Brussels and the EU is adversarial.  \n   a. He never pauses to offer genuine praise or admit success. Positive facts (cheap wine, cakes) are always followed immediately by criticism or sarcasm. That is not a tonal shift; it\u2019s a rhetorical device to deepen his negativity.  \n2. The consistent use of derisive metaphors and irony underlines his unwavering negativity.  \n   a. Calling Brussels \u201ca living preview of the Europe to come\u201d frames the future as pre-doomed.  \n   b. Repeated references to \u201cred tape,\u201d \u201cossified monopolies,\u201d \u201cparasites,\u201d and \u201crapacious phone monopolies\u201d confirm sustained hostility.  \n3. The final vignette\u2014his longing for a patisserie\u2014only underscores his escape from the bureaucratic nightmare.  \n   a. Even his personal solace in bakery signs is tinged with nostalgia for simpler pleasures, not hope in the subject.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nDebater_B\u2019s \u201chope to dismay\u201d trajectory is unsupported. There is no hopeful passage to undermine later. Rather, the author consistently undermines and lampoons Europe\u2019s institutions and Brussels bureaucracy from paragraph one to the last. The correct reading is that the tone remains steadfastly oppositional throughout.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Debater_B Misreads Sarcasm as \u201cHope\u201d  \n1. What Debater_B calls \u201ccuriosity\u201d or \u201cimplicit optimism\u201d is actually sarcasm.  \n   a. Opening line: \u201cThe Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \u2018Capital of Europe\u2019\u2009\u2026\u2009\u201d sounds neutral on the surface, but is immediately undercut by \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost.\u201d That is not curiosity\u2014it is contempt wrapped in feigned praise.  \n   b. The phrase \u201cThe European Union couldn't have picked a better home\u201d (<quote>The European Union couldn't have picked a better home.</quote>) drips with irony, not genuine praise. Debater_B treats this as admiration, but the context (\"red tape\u2009\u2026\u2009declining at great cost\") makes it mockery.  \n\n2. \u201cPerhaps a living preview of the Europe to come\u201d (<quote>what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels</quote>) again sits on a bed of negative qualifiers\u2014\u201cred tape,\u201d \u201cpomp,\u201d \u201cparalyzed\u201d\u2014making clear the author\u2019s disdain from the very first paragraph. There is no neutral or positive moment for Debater_B\u2019s \u201chope\u201d to spring from.  \n\nII. No Actual Arc\u2014Only Deepening Contempt  \n1. If the author were optimistic at first, he would have at least one unqualified positive observation early on. Instead, every \u201cpositive\u201d detail is immediately undercut.  \n   \u2022 Lobster bisque, public transportation, historic churches are all listed alongside \u201cmonumental traffic jams,\u201d \u201cdeclining infrastructure,\u201d and \u201clethargy and despair.\u201d These juxtapositions serve not to chart a journey from good to bad, but to intensify mockery.  \n\n2. The author\u2019s tone tightens, not shifts. He never pauses to reconsider or soften his outlook. Each successive section\u2014strikes, work rules, telephone monopolies, the euro debt trap, corruption in NATO, the Berlaymont fiasco\u2014simply adds new layers to his original contempt. There is no moment of doubt, no hesitation, no \u201caha\u201d revealing changed feelings.  \n\nIII. Consistent Use of Derisive Devices  \n1. Irony and hyperbole saturate every paragraph:  \n   \u2022 \u201cYou can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids.\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cJudas beer\u201d in a Catholic country\u2014\u201cTaste you can trust.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Belgacom\u2019s 5-cent-a-minute rape of your wallet.  \n   None of these devices signals a tonal pivot\u2014they are variations on the same note of scorn.  \n\n2. Even his concluding \u201cescape\u201d to a patisserie is tinted with bitterness toward his surroundings: the bakery sign \u201ccalls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.\u201d He\u2019s not celebrating Brussels\u2014he\u2019s yearning to flee it.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nDebater_B conflates ironic mockery with \u201chope\u201d and treats a deepening catalog of complaints as if it were an \u201carc of disillusionment.\u201d In reality, the author sets out from the first sentence to satirize and condemn Brussels and the EU, and he never lets up. The tone remains steadfastly oppositional throughout, making \u201cThey remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\u201d the only accurate answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A Misreads Tone and Ignores Context  \n1. Sarcasm \u2260 Unchanging Hostility. Debater_A conflates early irony with immutable contempt, but irony often coexists with underlying interest. Calling Brussels \u201cbe a living preview of the Europe to come:\u201d (<quote>what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels</quote>) signals genuine curiosity about the EU as an experimental metagovernment.  \n2. Cherry-picking Negative Details. Debater_A treats every mention of bureaucracy or absurdity as proof of fixed disdain. But the text presents positives\u2014\u201cone of Europe\u2019s biggest stories, an important organization\u201d (<quote>the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization</quote>)\u2014before it catalogs failures. Ignoring that initial intrigue destroys their thesis.\n\nII. Clear Arc from Hope to Dismay  \n1. Opening: Cautious Optimism  \n   \u2022 The author frames the EU as a \u201cstory\u201d and Brussels as its living laboratory, language no true opponent would use if wholly hostile (<quote>be a living preview of the Europe to come:</quote>).  \n2. Middle: Rising Disappointment  \n   \u2022 He shifts to surprise at \u201ccrumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic\u201d Belgium (<quote>Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic .</quote>), each adjective piling onto the last.  \n   \u2022 Strikes that smash terminals and draconian work rules\u2014\u201cretirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work\u201d\u2014show a dawning realization of systemic malaise.  \n3. Finale: Full-Blown Dismay  \n   \u2022 By the end, Brussels\u2019s grandeur turns grotesque: secret meetings, idling limousines, a mothballed asbestos tower costing \u20ac50 million to \u201ckeep \u2026 closed\u201d (<quote>European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed</quote>).  \n   \u2022 This crescendo of bureaucratic excess confirms his final disillusionment.\n\nIII. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cSteadfast Opposition\u201d Theory Fails  \n1. No Room for Positive Framing? Contradicted by Text. Debater_A insists there is \u201czero celebratory language early on,\u201d yet the author\u2019s described \u201cimportant organization\u201d is praise. A wholly oppositional tone couldn\u2019t sustain that.  \n2. No Evidence of Static Sarcasm. The author\u2019s language intensifies from mild skepticism to outright scorn. Sarcasm alone doesn\u2019t account for the arc of adjectives, examples, and increasing frustration.\n\nIV. Conclusion  \nTaken as a whole, the essay traces an unmistakable journey: initial interest and guarded hope about Europe\u2019s promise give way to mounting dismay as each layer of bureaucracy and cultural dysfunction is uncovered. This dynamic progression proves that \u201cThey start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed with further findings\u201d is the correct reading\u2014and that Debater_A\u2019s claim of unvarying opposition collapses under the text\u2019s own structure and language.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
