They gnawed\n\n at her soil, drank deep of her seas. Where, on\n\n this gutted cosmic carcass, could humanity flee?\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Westover got a shock when he stumbled onto the monster, for all that he  knew one had been through here.\n\n\n He had been following the high ground toward the hills, alternately  splashing through waist-deep water and climbing onto comparatively dry  knolls. To right and left of him was the sullen noise of the river in  flood, and behind him, too, the rising water he had barely escaped. The  night was overcast, the moon a faint disk of glow that left river and  hills and even the mud underfoot invisible.\n\n\n He had not sought in his mind for the flood's cause, but had merely  taken it numbly as part of the fury and confusion of a world in ruin.  Anyway, he was dead tired out on his feet.\n\n\n He sensed more than saw the looming wall before him, but he thought  it the bare ledge-rock of a stripped hillside until he stepped into a  small pot-hole and lurched forward, and his outflung hands sank into  the slime that covered a surface faintly, horrifyingly resilient.\n\n\n He recoiled as if seared, and retreated, slithering in the muck. For  moments his mind was full of dark formless panic; then he took a firm  hold on himself and tried to comprehend the situation.\n\n\n Nothing was distinguishable beyond a few yards, but his mind's eye  could see the rest\u2014the immense slug-like shape that extended in  ponderous repose across the river valley, its head and tail spilling  over the hills on either side, five miles apart. The beast was  quiescent until morning\u2014sleeping, if such things slept.\n\n\n And that explained the flood; the monster's body had formed an  unbreakable dam behind which the river had been steadily piling up in  those first hours of night; if it did not move until dawn, the level  would be far higher then.\n\n\n Westover stood motionless in the blackness; how long, he did not know.  He was hardly aware of the water that covered his feet, crept over his  ankles, and swirled halfway to his knees. Only the emergence of the  moon through a rift of the cloud blanket brought him awake; its dim  light gleamed all around on a great sheet of water, unbroken save for  scattered black hummocks\u2014crests of knolls like that on which he stood,  all soon to be hidden by the rising flood.\n\n\n For a moment he knew despair. The way back was impassable, and the way  ahead was blocked by the titanic enemy.\n\n\n Then the impersonal will that had driven him implacably two days and  nights without stopping came to his rescue. Westover plodded forward,  pressed his shrinking body against the slimy, faintly warm surface of  the monster's foot, and sought above him with upstretched hands\u2014found  holds, and began to climb with a strength he had not known was left in  him.\n\n\n The moonlight's fading again was merciful as he climbed the sheer,  slippery face of the foot; but he could hear the wash and chuckle of  the flood below. His tired brain told him treacherously: \"I'm already  asleep\u2014this is a nightmare.\" Once, listening to that insidious voice,  he slipped and for instants hung dizzily by his hands, and for some  minutes after he had found a new foothold merely clung panting with  pounding heart.\n\n\n Some time after he had found courage to resume the climb, he dragged  himself, gasping and quivering, to comparative safety on the broad  shelf that marked the rim of the foot. Above him lay the great black  steep that rose to the summit of the monster's humped back, a mountain  to be climbed. Westover felt poignantly that his exhausted body could  not make that ascent and face the long and dangerous descent beyond,  which he had to make before dawn ... but not now ... not now.... He lay in a state between waking and dreaming, high on the monster's  side; and it seemed that the colossal body moved, swelling and  sighing\u2014but he knew they did not breathe as backboned animals do.  Westover had been one of the men who, in the days when humanity was  still fighting, had accumulated quite a store of knowledge about the  enemy\u2014the enemy that was brainless and toolless, but that was simply  too vast for human intelligence and weapons to defeat....\n\n\n Westover no longer saw the murky moonlight, the far faint glitter of  the flood or the slope of the living mountain. He saw, as he had seen  from a circling jet plane, an immense tree of smoke that rose and  expanded under the noonday sun, creamy white above and black and oily  below, and beneath the black cloud something that writhed and flowed  sluggishly in a cyclopean death agony.\n\n\n That picture dissolved, and was replaced by the face of a man\u2014one who  might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated  planet. It was an ordinary face, roundish, spectacled, but etched now  by tragedy; the voice that went with it was flat, unemotional, pedantic.\n\n\n \"There are so many of them, and we've destroyed so few\u2014and to kill  those few took our mightiest weapons. Examination of the ones that have  been killed discloses the reason why ordinary projectiles and bombs and  poisons are ineffective against them\u2014apart, that is, from the chief  reason of sheer size. The creatures are so loosely organized that a  local injury hardly affects the whole. In a sense, each one of them is  a single cell\u2014like the slime molds, the Earthly life forms that most  resemble them.\n\n\n \"That striking resemblance, together with the fact that they chose  Earth to attack out of all the planets of the Solar System, shows they  must have originated on a world much like this. But while on Earth the  slime molds are the highest reticular organisms, and the dominant life  is all multicellular, on the monsters' home world conditions must have  favored unicellular growth. Probably as a result of this unspecialized  structure, the monsters have attained their great size and perhaps for  the same reason they have achieved what even intelligent cellular life  so far hasn't\u2014liberation from existence bound to one world's surface,  the conquest of space. They accomplished it not by invention but by  adaptation, as brainless life once crawled out of the sea to conquer  the dry land.\n\n\n \"The monsters who have descended on Earth must represent the end result  of a long evolution completed in space itself. They are evidently  deep-space beings, able to propel themselves from planet to planet and  from star to star in search of food, guided by instinct to suns and  worlds like ours. Descending on such a planet, they move across its  surface systematically ingesting all edible material\u2014all life not  mobile enough to avoid their march. They are like caterpillars that  overrun a planet and strip it of its leaves, before moving on to the  next.\n\n\n \"Man is a highly mobile species, so our direct casualties of this  invasion have been very light and will continue to be. But when the  monsters have finished with Earth, there will be no vegetation left  for man's food, no houses, no cities, none of the fixed installations  of civilization, and the end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured by the monsters.\" Westover awoke, feeling himself bathed by the cold sweat of  nightmare\u2014then he realized that a misty rain had wetted his face and  sogged his clothes. That, and the sleep he had had, refreshed him and  made his mind clearer than it had been for days, and he remembered that  he could not sleep but had to go on, searching with a hope that would  not die for some miraculously spared refuge where civilization and  science might yet exist, where there would be the means to realize his  idea for stopping the monsters.\n\n\n He sat up, eyes searching the sky for a sign to tell him how long he  had slept. Low on the western horizon he found the faint glow that told  of the moon's setting; and in the east a stronger light was already  struggling through the clouds and mist, becoming every moment less  tenuous and illusory, more the bitter reality of the breaking day.\n\n\n Even as Westover began frantically climbing, out of that lightening  sky the hopelessness of his effort pressed down on him. With dawn the  monster would begin to move, to crawl eastward impelled by the same dim  phototropic urge which must guide these things out of the interstellar  depths to Sun-type stars. All of them had crept endlessly eastward  around the Earth, gutting the continents and churning the sea bottoms,  and by now whatever was left of human civilization must be starving  beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships at sea. The hordes that  still lived and wandered over the once populous fertile lands, like  this\u2014would not live long.\n\n\n For a man like Westover, who had been a scientist, it was not the  prospect of death that was most crushing, but the death blow to his  human pride, the star-storming pride of mind and will\u2014defeated by  sheer bulk and mindless hunger.\n\n\n Near the crest of the monster's back, he stumbled and fell hands and  knees on the shagreen-roughness of the skin; at first he thought only  that an attack of dizziness had made him fall, then he realized that  the surface beneath him had shifted. Unmistakably even in the misty  dawn-light, the hills and valleys of the rugose back were changing  shape, as the vast protoplasmic mass below crawled, flowed beneath its  integument. In slow peristaltic motion the waves marched eastward,  toward the monster's head.\n\n\n He could stay where he was unharmed, of course. On the monster's back,  of all places, he had nothing to fear from it or from others of its  kind. But he knew with desperate clarity that by nightfall, when the  beast became still once more, exhaustion and growing hunger would have  made him unable to descend. As he lay where he had fallen, he felt that  weakness creeping over him, no longer held in check by the will that  had kept him doggedly plodding forward.\n\n\n Again he lay half conscious, in a lethargy that unchecked must grow  steadily deeper until death. Isolated thoughts floated through his  head. It occurred to him that he was now ideally located to conduct  the experiments necessary to prove his theory of how to destroy the  monsters\u2014if only someone had had the foresight to build a biological  laboratory on the monster's back. Of course the rolling motion would  create special problems of technique.... Idiocy.... Once more he seemed  to glimpse Sutton's face, as the biologist calmly made that grisly  report to the President's Committee on Extermination.... Sutton's  prediction had been a hundred percent correct. The monsters' hunger  knew no halt until they had absorbed into themselves all the organic  material on the world which was their prey.... And men must starve, as  he was starving now.... With a struggle Westover roused himself, first sitting up, then swaying  to his feet, frowning with the effort to look sanely at the terrible  inspiration that had come to him. The cloud blanket was breaking up,  the sun already high, beating down on the naked moving plateau on which  the man stood. The idea born in him seemed to stand that light, even to  expand into hope.\n\n\n Fingers shaking, he unhitched the light ax from his belt and began to  hack with feverish industry at the monster's crusted hide.\n\n\n The scaly, weathered epidermis seemed immeasurably thick. But at last  he had chopped through it, reached the softer protoplasm beneath.  Clawing and hewing in the hole he had made, he tore out heavy slabs of  the monster's flesh.\n\n\n A ripple that did not belong to the crawling motion ran over the  thing's surface round about. Westover laughed wildly with a sudden  sense of power. He, the insignificant human mite, had made the  miles-long beast twitch like a flea-bitten dog.\n\n\n The analogy was pat; like a flea, he had lodged on a larger animal and  was about to nourish himself from it. The slabs of flesh he had cut off  were gray and unappetizing, but he knew from the studies he had helped  Sutton make that the monsters, extraterrestrial though they were, were  in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates one with man  or the amoeba, and therefore might be\u2014food.\n\n\n His matches were dry in their water-proof case; he made a smoldering  fire from the loose fibrous scale of the monster's back, and half an  hour later was replete. Either the long fast, or involuntary revulsion,  or perhaps merely the motion of the creature brought on nausea, but he  fought it sternly back and succeeded in keeping his strange meal down.  Then he was tormented by thirst. It was some time, though, before he  could bring himself to drink the colorless fluid that had collected in  the wound he had inflicted on the monster.\n\n\n Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea  on a dog. The monster crawled by day and rested by night; strengthened,  the man could have left it then, but somehow night after night he did  not. It wasn't, he argued with himself sometimes in the days when he  lay torpidly drowsing, lulled by the long sway, arms over his head to  protect him from the sun's baking, merely that he was chained to the  only source of food he knew in all the world\u2014not just that he was  developing a flea's psychology. He was a man and a scientist, and he  was conducting an experiment.... His life on the monster's back was  proving something, something of vast importance for man, the extinct  animal\u2014but for increasingly longer periods of time he could not  remember what it was....\n\n\n There came a morning, though, when he remembered. Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog. He woke with the sun's warmth on his body and the realization of  something amiss trickling through his head. It was a little while  before he recognized the wrongness, and when he did he sat bolt upright.\n\n\n The sun was already up, and the monster should have begun once more its  steady, ravenous march to the east. But there was no motion; the great  living expanse lay still around him. He wondered wildly if it was dead.\n\n\n Presently, though, he felt a faint shuddering and lift beneath his  feet, and heard far stifled mutterings and sighs.\n\n\n Westover's mind was beginning to function again; it was as though the  cessation of the rock and sway had exorcised the lethargy that had lain  upon him. He knew now that he had been almost insane for the time he  had passed here, touched by the madness that takes hermits and men lost  in deserts or oceans. And his was a stranger solitude than any of those.\n\n\n Now he listened strainingly to the portentous sounds of change in the  monster's vitals, and in a flash of insight knew them for what they  were. The scientists had found, in the burst bodies of the Titans  that had been killed by atomic bombs, the answer to the riddle of  these creatures' crossing of space: great vacuoles, pockets of gas  that in the living animal could be under exceedingly high pressures,  and that could be expelled to drive the monster in flight like a  reaction engine. Rocket propulsion, of course, was nothing new to  zoology; it was developed ages before man, by the squids and by those  odd degenerate relatives of the vertebrates that are called tunicates  because of their gaudy cellulose-plastic armor....\n\n\n The monster on which Westover had been living as a parasite was  generating gases within itself, preparing to leave the ravished Earth.  That was the meaning of its gargantuan belly rumblings. And they meant  further that he must finally leave it\u2014now or never\u2014or be borne aloft  to die gasping in the stratosphere.\n\n\n Hurriedly the man scrambled to the highest eminence of the back and  stood looking about; and what he saw brought him to the brink of  despair. For all around lay blue water, waves dancing and glinting in  the fresh breeze; and sniffing the air he recognized the salt tang  of the sea. While he slept the monster had crept beyond the coast  line, and lay now in what to it was shallow water\u2014fifty or a hundred  fathoms. Back the way it had come, a headland was visible, mockingly,  hopelessly distant.\n\n\n Of course\u2014the great beast would crawl into the sea, which would float  its bloated bulk and enable it to accelerate and take flight. It would  never have been able to lift itself into the air from the dry land.\n\n\n He should have foreseen that and made his escape in time. Now that  he had solved the problem of human survival.... But the bright ocean  laughed at him, sparkling away wave beyond rolling wave, and beyond  that blue headland could be only a land made desert, where men become  beasts fought crazily over the last morsels of food. He had lost track  of the days he had been on the monster's back, but the rape of Earth  must be finished now. He had no doubt that the things would depart  as they had come into the Solar System\u2014in that close, seemingly  one-willed swarm that Earth's astronomers had at first taken for a  comet. If this one was leaving, the rest no doubt were too.\n\n\n Westover sat for a space with head in hands, hearing the faint  continuing murmurs from below. And he remembered the voices. He had been hearing them again as he awoke\u2014the distant muffled voices  whose words he could not make out, not the small close ones that  sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even  called his name. The latter had to be, as he had vaguely accepted them  even then, illusions\u2014but the others\u2014with his new clarity he was  suddenly sure that they had been real.\n\n\n And a wild, white light of hope blazed in him, and he flung himself  flat on the rough surface, beat on it with bare fists and shouted:  \"Help! Here I am! Help!\"\n\n\n He paused to listen with fierce intentness, and heard nothing but the  faint eructations deep inside the monster.\n\n\n Then he sprang to his feet, gripping his hand-ax, and ran panting to  the place where he had dug for food. His excavations tended to close  and heal overnight; now he went to work with vicious strokes enlarging  the latest one, hacking and tearing it deeper and deeper.\n\n\n He was almost hidden in the cavity when a shadow fell across him from  behind. He whirled, for there could be no shadows on the monster's back.\n\n\n A man stood watching him calmly\u2014an elderly man in rusty black  clothing, leaning on a stick. The staff, the snowy beard, and something  that smoldered behind the benign eyes, gave him the look of an ancient  prophet.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" asked Westover, breathlessly but almost without surprise.\n\n\n \"I am the Preacher,\" the old man said. \"The Lord hath sent me to save  you. Arise, my son, and follow me.\"\n\n\n Westover hesitated. \"I'm not just imagining you?\" he appealed.  \"Somebody else has really found the answer?\"\n\n\n The Preacher's brows knitted faintly, but then his look turned to  benevolent understanding. \"You have been alone too long here. Come with  me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor.\"\n\n\n Westover was still not sure that the other was more than one of the  powerful specters of childhood\u2014the Preacher, the Doctor, no doubt the  Teacher next\u2014risen to rob him of his last shreds of sanity. But he  nodded in childlike obedience, and followed.\n\n\n When, a few hundred yards nearer the monster's head, the other halted  at a black rent in the rugose hide, the mouth of a burrow descending  into utter blackness\u2014Westover knew that both the Preacher and his own  wild hope were real.\n\n\n \"Down here. Into the belly of Leviathan,\" said the old man solemnly,  and Westover nodded this time with alacrity. The crawling descent through the twisting, Stygian burrow had much  that ought to belong to a journey into Hell.... More than that, no  demonologist's imagination could have conceived without experiencing  the sheer horror of the yielding beslimed walls that seemed every  moment squeezing in to trap them unspeakably. The air was warm and  rank with the familiar heavy sweetish odor of the monster's colorless  blood....\n\n\n Then, as he knew it must, a light glimmered ahead, the sinus widened,  and Westover climbed to his feet and stood, weak-kneed still, staring  at a chamber carved in the veritable belly of Leviathan. The floor  underfoot was firm, as was the wall his shaking fingers tested.  Dazzled, he saw tools leaning against the walls, spades, crowbars,  axes, and a half-dozen people, men and women in rough grimy clothing,  who stood watching him with lively interest.\n\n\n The Preacher stood beside him, breathing hard and mopping his forehead.  But he brushed aside the deferential offers of the others: \"No\u2014I will  take him to the Doctor myself. All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"\n\n\n There was another tunnel to be crawled through, but that one was  firm-walled as the room they left behind. They emerged into a larger  cavern, that like the first was lit\u2014only now did the miracle of it  obtrude itself in his dazed mind\u2014by fluorescent tubes, and filled with  equipment that gleamed glass and metal. Over an apparatus with many  fluid-dripping trays, like an air-conditioning device, bent a lone man.\n\n\n \"Is it working?\" inquired the Preacher.\n\n\n \"It's working,\" the other answered without looking up from the  adjustment he was making. Bubbles were rising in the fluid that filled  the trays, rising and bursting, rising and bursting with a curiously  fascinating monotony. The subtly tense attitudes of the two initiates  told Westover better than words that there was something hugely  important in the success of whatever magic was producing those bubbles.\n\n\n The thaumaturge straightened, wiping his hands on his trousers as he  turned with a satisfied grin on his round, spectacled face\u2014then both  he and Westover froze in dumbfounded recognition. Sutton was first to recover. He said quietly, \"Welcome aboard the ark,  Bill. You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\" His  quick eyes studied Westover's face, and he gestured toward a packing  box against the wall opposite his apparatus. \"Sit down. You've been  through the mill.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Westover sat down dizzily. \"I've been aboard your ark  for some time now, though. Only as an ectoparasite.\"\n\n\n \"It's high time you joined the endoparasites. Lucky you scratched  around enough up there to create repercussions we could feel down here.  You got the same idea, then?\"\n\n\n \"I stumbled onto it,\" Westover admitted. \"I was wandering across  country\u2014my plane crashed on the way back from that South American  bug hunt dreamed up by somebody who'd been reading Wells' War of the  Worlds . I think my pilot went nuts; you could see too much of the  destruction from up there.... But I got out in one piece and started  walking\u2014looking for some place with people and facilities that could  try out my method of killing the monsters. I thought\u2014I still think\u2014I  had a sure-fire way to do that\u2014but I didn't realize then that it was  too late to think of killing them off.\"\n\n\n Sutton nodded thoughtfully. \"It was too late\u2014or too early, perhaps.  We'll have to talk that over.\"\n\n\n Westover finished the brief account of his coming to dwell on the  monster's back. The other grinned happily.\n\n\n \"You began with the practice, where I worked out the theory first.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got so far with the theory,\" said Westover, \"but I think  I've got the main outlines. Until the monsters came, man was a parasite  on the face of the Earth. Fundamentally, parasitism\u2014on the green  plants and their by-products\u2014was our way of life, as of all animals  from the beginning. But the monsters absorbed into themselves all the  plant food and even the organic material in the soil. So we have only  one way out\u2014to transfer our parasitism to the only remaining food  source\u2014the monsters themselves.\n\n\n \"The monsters almost defeated us, because of their two special  adaptations of extreme size and ability to cross space. But man has  always won the battle of adaptations before, because he could improvise  new ones as the need arose. The greatest crisis humanity ever faced  called for the most radical innovation in our way of life.\"\n\n\n \"Very well put,\" approved Sutton. \"Except that you make it sound easy.  By the time I'd worked it out like that, things were already in  such a turmoil that putting it into effect was the devil's own job.  About the only ones I could find to help me were the Preacher and his  people. They have the faith that moves mountains, that has made this  self-moving mountain inhabitable.\"\n\n\n \"It is inhabitable?\" Westover's question reflected no doubt. Sutton gestured at the bubbling device behind him. \"That thing is  making air now, which we're going to need when the monster's in space.  It was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I  hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2014that's  its blood flowing through the filters. We've got an electric generator  running by tapping the monster's internal gas pressure. There are  problems left before we'll be fully self-sufficient here\u2014but the  monster is so much like us in fundamental makeup that its body contains  all the elements human life needs too.\"\n\n\n \"Then,\" Westover glanced appreciatively around, \"it looks like the main  hazard is claustrophobia.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about a cave-in. We're surrounded by solid cystoid  tissue. But,\" Sutton's voice took on a graver note, \"there may be  other psychological dangers. I don't think all our people\u2014there are  fifty-one, fifty-two of us now\u2014realize yet that this colony isn't just  a temporary expedient. Human history hasn't had such a turning-point  since men first started chipping stone. Spengler's Mensch als  Raubtier \u2014if he ever existed\u2014has to be replaced by the Mensch als  Schmarotzer , and the adjustment may come hard. We've got to plan  for the rest of our lives\u2014and our children's and our children's  children's\u2014as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can  manage to\u2014infect\u2014when they're clustered again in space.\"\n\n\n \"For the future,\" put in the Preacher, who had watched benignly the  biologists' reunion, \"the Lord will provide, even as He did unto Jonah  when he cried to Him out of the belly of the fish.\"\n\n\n \"Amen,\" agreed Sutton. But the gaze he fixed on Westover was oddly  troubled. \"Speaking of the future brings up the question of the idea  you mentioned\u2014your monster-killing scheme.\" Westover flexed his hands involuntarily, like one who has been too  long enforcedly idle. In terse eager sentences he outlined for Sutton  the plan that had burned in him during his bitter wandering over  the face of the ruined land. It would be very easy to accomplish  from an endoparasite's point of vantage, merely by isolating from  the creature's blood over a long period enough of some potent  secretion\u2014hormone, enzyme or the like\u2014to kill when suddenly  reintroduced into the system. \"Originally I thought we could accomplish  the same thing by synthesis\u2014but this way will be simpler.\"\n\n\n \"Beautifully simple.\" Sutton smiled wryly. \"So much so that I wish  you'd never thought of it.\"\n\n\n Westover stared. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Describing your plan, you sounded almost ready to put it into effect  on the spot.\"\n\n\n \"No! Of course I realize\u2014Well, I see what you mean\u2014I think.\" Westover  was crestfallen.\n\n\n Sutton smiled faintly.\n\n\n \"I think you do, Bill. To survive, we've got to be good parasites.  That means before all, for the coming generations, that we keep our  numbers down. A good parasite doesn't destroy or even overtax its host.  We don't want to follow the sorry example of such unsuccessful species  as the bugs of bubonic plague or typhoid; we'll do better to model  ourselves on the humble tapeworm.\n\n\n \"Your idea is dangerous for the same reason. The monsters probably  spend thousands of years in interstellar space; during that time  they'll be living exclusively on their fat\u2014the fuel they stored on  Earth, and so will we. We've got a whole new history of man ahead  of us, under such changed conditions that we can't begin to predict  what turns it may take. There's a very great danger that men will  proliferate until they kill their hosts. But imagine a struggle for Lebensraum when all the living space there is is a few thousand  monsters capable of supporting a very limited number of people  each\u2014with your method giving an easy way to destroy these little  worlds our descendants will inhabit. It's too much dynamite to have  around the house.\"\n\n\n Westover bowed his head, but he had caught a curiously expectant glint  in Sutton's eyes as he spoke. He thought, and his face lightened.  \"Suppose we work out a way to record my idea, one that can't be  deciphered by anyone unintelligent enough to be likely to misuse it. A  riddle for our descendants\u2014who should have use for it some day.\"\n\n\n At last Sutton smiled. \"That's better. You've thought it through to  the end, I see.... This phase of our history won't last forever.  Eventually, the monsters will come to another planet not too unlike  Earth, because it's on such worlds they prey. A tapeworm can cross the  Sahara desert in the intestine of a camel\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice was drowned in a vast hissing roar. An irresistible pressure  distorted the walls of the chamber and scythed its occupants from their  feet. Sutton staggered drunkenly almost erect, fought his way across  the tilting floor to make sure of his precious apparatus. He turned  back toward the others, bracing himself and shouting something; then,  knowing his words lost in the thunder, gestured toward the Earth they  were leaving, a half-regretful, half-triumphant farewell.

They gnawed\n\n at her soil, drank deep of her seas. Where, on\n\n this gutted cosmic carcass, could humanity flee?\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Westover got a shock when he stumbled onto the monster, for all that he  knew one had been through here.\n\n\n He had been following the high ground toward the hills, alternately  splashing through waist-deep water and climbing onto comparatively dry  knolls. To right and left of him was the sullen noise of the river in  flood, and behind him, too, the rising water he had barely escaped. The  night was overcast, the moon a faint disk of glow that left river and  hills and even the mud underfoot invisible.\n\n\n He had not sought in his mind for the flood's cause, but had merely  taken it numbly as part of the fury and confusion of a world in ruin.  Anyway, he was dead tired out on his feet.\n\n\n He sensed more than saw the looming wall before him, but he thought  it the bare ledge-rock of a stripped hillside until he stepped into a  small pot-hole and lurched forward, and his outflung hands sank into  the slime that covered a surface faintly, horrifyingly resilient.\n\n\n He recoiled as if seared, and retreated, slithering in the muck. For  moments his mind was full of dark formless panic; then he took a firm  hold on himself and tried to comprehend the situation.\n\n\n Nothing was distinguishable beyond a few yards, but his mind's eye  could see the rest\u2014the immense slug-like shape that extended in  ponderous repose across the river valley, its head and tail spilling  over the hills on either side, five miles apart. The beast was  quiescent until morning\u2014sleeping, if such things slept.\n\n\n And that explained the flood; the monster's body had formed an  unbreakable dam behind which the river had been steadily piling up in  those first hours of night; if it did not move until dawn, the level  would be far higher then.\n\n\n Westover stood motionless in the blackness; how long, he did not know.  He was hardly aware of the water that covered his feet, crept over his  ankles, and swirled halfway to his knees. Only the emergence of the  moon through a rift of the cloud blanket brought him awake; its dim  light gleamed all around on a great sheet of water, unbroken save for  scattered black hummocks\u2014crests of knolls like that on which he stood,  all soon to be hidden by the rising flood.\n\n\n For a moment he knew despair. The way back was impassable, and the way  ahead was blocked by the titanic enemy.\n\n\n Then the impersonal will that had driven him implacably two days and  nights without stopping came to his rescue. Westover plodded forward,  pressed his shrinking body against the slimy, faintly warm surface of  the monster's foot, and sought above him with upstretched hands\u2014found  holds, and began to climb with a strength he had not known was left in  him.\n\n\n The moonlight's fading again was merciful as he climbed the sheer,  slippery face of the foot; but he could hear the wash and chuckle of  the flood below. His tired brain told him treacherously: \"I'm already  asleep\u2014this is a nightmare.\" Once, listening to that insidious voice,  he slipped and for instants hung dizzily by his hands, and for some  minutes after he had found a new foothold merely clung panting with  pounding heart.\n\n\n Some time after he had found courage to resume the climb, he dragged  himself, gasping and quivering, to comparative safety on the broad  shelf that marked the rim of the foot. Above him lay the great black  steep that rose to the summit of the monster's humped back, a mountain  to be climbed. Westover felt poignantly that his exhausted body could  not make that ascent and face the long and dangerous descent beyond,  which he had to make before dawn ... but not now ... not now.... He lay in a state between waking and dreaming, high on the monster's  side; and it seemed that the colossal body moved, swelling and  sighing\u2014but he knew they did not breathe as backboned animals do.  Westover had been one of the men who, in the days when humanity was  still fighting, had accumulated quite a store of knowledge about the  enemy\u2014the enemy that was brainless and toolless, but that was simply  too vast for human intelligence and weapons to defeat....\n\n\n Westover no longer saw the murky moonlight, the far faint glitter of  the flood or the slope of the living mountain. He saw, as he had seen  from a circling jet plane, an immense tree of smoke that rose and  expanded under the noonday sun, creamy white above and black and oily  below, and beneath the black cloud something that writhed and flowed  sluggishly in a cyclopean death agony.\n\n\n That picture dissolved, and was replaced by the face of a man\u2014one who  might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated  planet. It was an ordinary face, roundish, spectacled, but etched now  by tragedy; the voice that went with it was flat, unemotional, pedantic.\n\n\n \"There are so many of them, and we've destroyed so few\u2014and to kill  those few took our mightiest weapons. Examination of the ones that have  been killed discloses the reason why ordinary projectiles and bombs and  poisons are ineffective against them\u2014apart, that is, from the chief  reason of sheer size. The creatures are so loosely organized that a  local injury hardly affects the whole. In a sense, each one of them is  a single cell\u2014like the slime molds, the Earthly life forms that most  resemble them.\n\n\n \"That striking resemblance, together with the fact that they chose  Earth to attack out of all the planets of the Solar System, shows they  must have originated on a world much like this. But while on Earth the  slime molds are the highest reticular organisms, and the dominant life  is all multicellular, on the monsters' home world conditions must have  favored unicellular growth. Probably as a result of this unspecialized  structure, the monsters have attained their great size and perhaps for  the same reason they have achieved what even intelligent cellular life  so far hasn't\u2014liberation from existence bound to one world's surface,  the conquest of space. They accomplished it not by invention but by  adaptation, as brainless life once crawled out of the sea to conquer  the dry land.\n\n\n \"The monsters who have descended on Earth must represent the end result  of a long evolution completed in space itself. They are evidently  deep-space beings, able to propel themselves from planet to planet and  from star to star in search of food, guided by instinct to suns and  worlds like ours. Descending on such a planet, they move across its  surface systematically ingesting all edible material\u2014all life not  mobile enough to avoid their march. They are like caterpillars that  overrun a planet and strip it of its leaves, before moving on to the  next.\n\n\n \"Man is a highly mobile species, so our direct casualties of this  invasion have been very light and will continue to be. But when the  monsters have finished with Earth, there will be no vegetation left  for man's food, no houses, no cities, none of the fixed installations  of civilization, and the end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured by the monsters.\" Westover awoke, feeling himself bathed by the cold sweat of  nightmare\u2014then he realized that a misty rain had wetted his face and  sogged his clothes. That, and the sleep he had had, refreshed him and  made his mind clearer than it had been for days, and he remembered that  he could not sleep but had to go on, searching with a hope that would  not die for some miraculously spared refuge where civilization and  science might yet exist, where there would be the means to realize his  idea for stopping the monsters.\n\n\n He sat up, eyes searching the sky for a sign to tell him how long he  had slept. Low on the western horizon he found the faint glow that told  of the moon's setting; and in the east a stronger light was already  struggling through the clouds and mist, becoming every moment less  tenuous and illusory, more the bitter reality of the breaking day.\n\n\n Even as Westover began frantically climbing, out of that lightening  sky the hopelessness of his effort pressed down on him. With dawn the  monster would begin to move, to crawl eastward impelled by the same dim  phototropic urge which must guide these things out of the interstellar  depths to Sun-type stars. All of them had crept endlessly eastward  around the Earth, gutting the continents and churning the sea bottoms,  and by now whatever was left of human civilization must be starving  beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships at sea. The hordes that  still lived and wandered over the once populous fertile lands, like  this\u2014would not live long.\n\n\n For a man like Westover, who had been a scientist, it was not the  prospect of death that was most crushing, but the death blow to his  human pride, the star-storming pride of mind and will\u2014defeated by  sheer bulk and mindless hunger.\n\n\n Near the crest of the monster's back, he stumbled and fell hands and  knees on the shagreen-roughness of the skin; at first he thought only  that an attack of dizziness had made him fall, then he realized that  the surface beneath him had shifted. Unmistakably even in the misty  dawn-light, the hills and valleys of the rugose back were changing  shape, as the vast protoplasmic mass below crawled, flowed beneath its  integument. In slow peristaltic motion the waves marched eastward,  toward the monster's head.\n\n\n He could stay where he was unharmed, of course. On the monster's back,  of all places, he had nothing to fear from it or from others of its  kind. But he knew with desperate clarity that by nightfall, when the  beast became still once more, exhaustion and growing hunger would have  made him unable to descend. As he lay where he had fallen, he felt that  weakness creeping over him, no longer held in check by the will that  had kept him doggedly plodding forward.\n\n\n Again he lay half conscious, in a lethargy that unchecked must grow  steadily deeper until death. Isolated thoughts floated through his  head. It occurred to him that he was now ideally located to conduct  the experiments necessary to prove his theory of how to destroy the  monsters\u2014if only someone had had the foresight to build a biological  laboratory on the monster's back. Of course the rolling motion would  create special problems of technique.... Idiocy.... Once more he seemed  to glimpse Sutton's face, as the biologist calmly made that grisly  report to the President's Committee on Extermination.... Sutton's  prediction had been a hundred percent correct. The monsters' hunger  knew no halt until they had absorbed into themselves all the organic  material on the world which was their prey.... And men must starve, as  he was starving now.... With a struggle Westover roused himself, first sitting up, then swaying  to his feet, frowning with the effort to look sanely at the terrible  inspiration that had come to him. The cloud blanket was breaking up,  the sun already high, beating down on the naked moving plateau on which  the man stood. The idea born in him seemed to stand that light, even to  expand into hope.\n\n\n Fingers shaking, he unhitched the light ax from his belt and began to  hack with feverish industry at the monster's crusted hide.\n\n\n The scaly, weathered epidermis seemed immeasurably thick. But at last  he had chopped through it, reached the softer protoplasm beneath.  Clawing and hewing in the hole he had made, he tore out heavy slabs of  the monster's flesh.\n\n\n A ripple that did not belong to the crawling motion ran over the  thing's surface round about. Westover laughed wildly with a sudden  sense of power. He, the insignificant human mite, had made the  miles-long beast twitch like a flea-bitten dog.\n\n\n The analogy was pat; like a flea, he had lodged on a larger animal and  was about to nourish himself from it. The slabs of flesh he had cut off  were gray and unappetizing, but he knew from the studies he had helped  Sutton make that the monsters, extraterrestrial though they were, were  in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates one with man  or the amoeba, and therefore might be\u2014food.\n\n\n His matches were dry in their water-proof case; he made a smoldering  fire from the loose fibrous scale of the monster's back, and half an  hour later was replete. Either the long fast, or involuntary revulsion,  or perhaps merely the motion of the creature brought on nausea, but he  fought it sternly back and succeeded in keeping his strange meal down.  Then he was tormented by thirst. It was some time, though, before he  could bring himself to drink the colorless fluid that had collected in  the wound he had inflicted on the monster.\n\n\n Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea  on a dog. The monster crawled by day and rested by night; strengthened,  the man could have left it then, but somehow night after night he did  not. It wasn't, he argued with himself sometimes in the days when he  lay torpidly drowsing, lulled by the long sway, arms over his head to  protect him from the sun's baking, merely that he was chained to the  only source of food he knew in all the world\u2014not just that he was  developing a flea's psychology. He was a man and a scientist, and he  was conducting an experiment.... His life on the monster's back was  proving something, something of vast importance for man, the extinct  animal\u2014but for increasingly longer periods of time he could not  remember what it was....\n\n\n There came a morning, though, when he remembered. Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog. He woke with the sun's warmth on his body and the realization of  something amiss trickling through his head. It was a little while  before he recognized the wrongness, and when he did he sat bolt upright.\n\n\n The sun was already up, and the monster should have begun once more its  steady, ravenous march to the east. But there was no motion; the great  living expanse lay still around him. He wondered wildly if it was dead.\n\n\n Presently, though, he felt a faint shuddering and lift beneath his  feet, and heard far stifled mutterings and sighs.\n\n\n Westover's mind was beginning to function again; it was as though the  cessation of the rock and sway had exorcised the lethargy that had lain  upon him. He knew now that he had been almost insane for the time he  had passed here, touched by the madness that takes hermits and men lost  in deserts or oceans. And his was a stranger solitude than any of those.\n\n\n Now he listened strainingly to the portentous sounds of change in the  monster's vitals, and in a flash of insight knew them for what they  were. The scientists had found, in the burst bodies of the Titans  that had been killed by atomic bombs, the answer to the riddle of  these creatures' crossing of space: great vacuoles, pockets of gas  that in the living animal could be under exceedingly high pressures,  and that could be expelled to drive the monster in flight like a  reaction engine. Rocket propulsion, of course, was nothing new to  zoology; it was developed ages before man, by the squids and by those  odd degenerate relatives of the vertebrates that are called tunicates  because of their gaudy cellulose-plastic armor....\n\n\n The monster on which Westover had been living as a parasite was  generating gases within itself, preparing to leave the ravished Earth.  That was the meaning of its gargantuan belly rumblings. And they meant  further that he must finally leave it\u2014now or never\u2014or be borne aloft  to die gasping in the stratosphere.\n\n\n Hurriedly the man scrambled to the highest eminence of the back and  stood looking about; and what he saw brought him to the brink of  despair. For all around lay blue water, waves dancing and glinting in  the fresh breeze; and sniffing the air he recognized the salt tang  of the sea. While he slept the monster had crept beyond the coast  line, and lay now in what to it was shallow water\u2014fifty or a hundred  fathoms. Back the way it had come, a headland was visible, mockingly,  hopelessly distant.\n\n\n Of course\u2014the great beast would crawl into the sea, which would float  its bloated bulk and enable it to accelerate and take flight. It would  never have been able to lift itself into the air from the dry land.\n\n\n He should have foreseen that and made his escape in time. Now that  he had solved the problem of human survival.... But the bright ocean  laughed at him, sparkling away wave beyond rolling wave, and beyond  that blue headland could be only a land made desert, where men become  beasts fought crazily over the last morsels of food. He had lost track  of the days he had been on the monster's back, but the rape of Earth  must be finished now. He had no doubt that the things would depart  as they had come into the Solar System\u2014in that close, seemingly  one-willed swarm that Earth's astronomers had at first taken for a  comet. If this one was leaving, the rest no doubt were too.\n\n\n Westover sat for a space with head in hands, hearing the faint  continuing murmurs from below. And he remembered the voices. He had been hearing them again as he awoke\u2014the distant muffled voices  whose words he could not make out, not the small close ones that  sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even  called his name. The latter had to be, as he had vaguely accepted them  even then, illusions\u2014but the others\u2014with his new clarity he was  suddenly sure that they had been real.\n\n\n And a wild, white light of hope blazed in him, and he flung himself  flat on the rough surface, beat on it with bare fists and shouted:  \"Help! Here I am! Help!\"\n\n\n He paused to listen with fierce intentness, and heard nothing but the  faint eructations deep inside the monster.\n\n\n Then he sprang to his feet, gripping his hand-ax, and ran panting to  the place where he had dug for food. His excavations tended to close  and heal overnight; now he went to work with vicious strokes enlarging  the latest one, hacking and tearing it deeper and deeper.\n\n\n He was almost hidden in the cavity when a shadow fell across him from  behind. He whirled, for there could be no shadows on the monster's back.\n\n\n A man stood watching him calmly\u2014an elderly man in rusty black  clothing, leaning on a stick. The staff, the snowy beard, and something  that smoldered behind the benign eyes, gave him the look of an ancient  prophet.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" asked Westover, breathlessly but almost without surprise.\n\n\n \"I am the Preacher,\" the old man said. \"The Lord hath sent me to save  you. Arise, my son, and follow me.\"\n\n\n Westover hesitated. \"I'm not just imagining you?\" he appealed.  \"Somebody else has really found the answer?\"\n\n\n The Preacher's brows knitted faintly, but then his look turned to  benevolent understanding. \"You have been alone too long here. Come with  me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor.\"\n\n\n Westover was still not sure that the other was more than one of the  powerful specters of childhood\u2014the Preacher, the Doctor, no doubt the  Teacher next\u2014risen to rob him of his last shreds of sanity. But he  nodded in childlike obedience, and followed.\n\n\n When, a few hundred yards nearer the monster's head, the other halted  at a black rent in the rugose hide, the mouth of a burrow descending  into utter blackness\u2014Westover knew that both the Preacher and his own  wild hope were real.\n\n\n \"Down here. Into the belly of Leviathan,\" said the old man solemnly,  and Westover nodded this time with alacrity. The crawling descent through the twisting, Stygian burrow had much  that ought to belong to a journey into Hell.... More than that, no  demonologist's imagination could have conceived without experiencing  the sheer horror of the yielding beslimed walls that seemed every  moment squeezing in to trap them unspeakably. The air was warm and  rank with the familiar heavy sweetish odor of the monster's colorless  blood....\n\n\n Then, as he knew it must, a light glimmered ahead, the sinus widened,  and Westover climbed to his feet and stood, weak-kneed still, staring  at a chamber carved in the veritable belly of Leviathan. The floor  underfoot was firm, as was the wall his shaking fingers tested.  Dazzled, he saw tools leaning against the walls, spades, crowbars,  axes, and a half-dozen people, men and women in rough grimy clothing,  who stood watching him with lively interest.\n\n\n The Preacher stood beside him, breathing hard and mopping his forehead.  But he brushed aside the deferential offers of the others: \"No\u2014I will  take him to the Doctor myself. All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"\n\n\n There was another tunnel to be crawled through, but that one was  firm-walled as the room they left behind. They emerged into a larger  cavern, that like the first was lit\u2014only now did the miracle of it  obtrude itself in his dazed mind\u2014by fluorescent tubes, and filled with  equipment that gleamed glass and metal. Over an apparatus with many  fluid-dripping trays, like an air-conditioning device, bent a lone man.\n\n\n \"Is it working?\" inquired the Preacher.\n\n\n \"It's working,\" the other answered without looking up from the  adjustment he was making. Bubbles were rising in the fluid that filled  the trays, rising and bursting, rising and bursting with a curiously  fascinating monotony. The subtly tense attitudes of the two initiates  told Westover better than words that there was something hugely  important in the success of whatever magic was producing those bubbles.\n\n\n The thaumaturge straightened, wiping his hands on his trousers as he  turned with a satisfied grin on his round, spectacled face\u2014then both  he and Westover froze in dumbfounded recognition. Sutton was first to recover. He said quietly, \"Welcome aboard the ark,  Bill. You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\" His  quick eyes studied Westover's face, and he gestured toward a packing  box against the wall opposite his apparatus. \"Sit down. You've been  through the mill.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Westover sat down dizzily. \"I've been aboard your ark  for some time now, though. Only as an ectoparasite.\"\n\n\n \"It's high time you joined the endoparasites. Lucky you scratched  around enough up there to create repercussions we could feel down here.  You got the same idea, then?\"\n\n\n \"I stumbled onto it,\" Westover admitted. \"I was wandering across  country\u2014my plane crashed on the way back from that South American  bug hunt dreamed up by somebody who'd been reading Wells' War of the  Worlds . I think my pilot went nuts; you could see too much of the  destruction from up there.... But I got out in one piece and started  walking\u2014looking for some place with people and facilities that could  try out my method of killing the monsters. I thought\u2014I still think\u2014I  had a sure-fire way to do that\u2014but I didn't realize then that it was  too late to think of killing them off.\"\n\n\n Sutton nodded thoughtfully. \"It was too late\u2014or too early, perhaps.  We'll have to talk that over.\"\n\n\n Westover finished the brief account of his coming to dwell on the  monster's back. The other grinned happily.\n\n\n \"You began with the practice, where I worked out the theory first.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got so far with the theory,\" said Westover, \"but I think  I've got the main outlines. Until the monsters came, man was a parasite  on the face of the Earth. Fundamentally, parasitism\u2014on the green  plants and their by-products\u2014was our way of life, as of all animals  from the beginning. But the monsters absorbed into themselves all the  plant food and even the organic material in the soil. So we have only  one way out\u2014to transfer our parasitism to the only remaining food  source\u2014the monsters themselves.\n\n\n \"The monsters almost defeated us, because of their two special  adaptations of extreme size and ability to cross space. But man has  always won the battle of adaptations before, because he could improvise  new ones as the need arose. The greatest crisis humanity ever faced  called for the most radical innovation in our way of life.\"\n\n\n \"Very well put,\" approved Sutton. \"Except that you make it sound easy.  By the time I'd worked it out like that, things were already in  such a turmoil that putting it into effect was the devil's own job.  About the only ones I could find to help me were the Preacher and his  people. They have the faith that moves mountains, that has made this  self-moving mountain inhabitable.\"\n\n\n \"It is inhabitable?\" Westover's question reflected no doubt. Sutton gestured at the bubbling device behind him. \"That thing is  making air now, which we're going to need when the monster's in space.  It was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I  hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2014that's  its blood flowing through the filters. We've got an electric generator  running by tapping the monster's internal gas pressure. There are  problems left before we'll be fully self-sufficient here\u2014but the  monster is so much like us in fundamental makeup that its body contains  all the elements human life needs too.\"\n\n\n \"Then,\" Westover glanced appreciatively around, \"it looks like the main  hazard is claustrophobia.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about a cave-in. We're surrounded by solid cystoid  tissue. But,\" Sutton's voice took on a graver note, \"there may be  other psychological dangers. I don't think all our people\u2014there are  fifty-one, fifty-two of us now\u2014realize yet that this colony isn't just  a temporary expedient. Human history hasn't had such a turning-point  since men first started chipping stone. Spengler's Mensch als  Raubtier \u2014if he ever existed\u2014has to be replaced by the Mensch als  Schmarotzer , and the adjustment may come hard. We've got to plan  for the rest of our lives\u2014and our children's and our children's  children's\u2014as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can  manage to\u2014infect\u2014when they're clustered again in space.\"\n\n\n \"For the future,\" put in the Preacher, who had watched benignly the  biologists' reunion, \"the Lord will provide, even as He did unto Jonah  when he cried to Him out of the belly of the fish.\"\n\n\n \"Amen,\" agreed Sutton. But the gaze he fixed on Westover was oddly  troubled. \"Speaking of the future brings up the question of the idea  you mentioned\u2014your monster-killing scheme.\" Westover flexed his hands involuntarily, like one who has been too  long enforcedly idle. In terse eager sentences he outlined for Sutton  the plan that had burned in him during his bitter wandering over  the face of the ruined land. It would be very easy to accomplish  from an endoparasite's point of vantage, merely by isolating from  the creature's blood over a long period enough of some potent  secretion\u2014hormone, enzyme or the like\u2014to kill when suddenly  reintroduced into the system. \"Originally I thought we could accomplish  the same thing by synthesis\u2014but this way will be simpler.\"\n\n\n \"Beautifully simple.\" Sutton smiled wryly. \"So much so that I wish  you'd never thought of it.\"\n\n\n Westover stared. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Describing your plan, you sounded almost ready to put it into effect  on the spot.\"\n\n\n \"No! Of course I realize\u2014Well, I see what you mean\u2014I think.\" Westover  was crestfallen.\n\n\n Sutton smiled faintly.\n\n\n \"I think you do, Bill. To survive, we've got to be good parasites.  That means before all, for the coming generations, that we keep our  numbers down. A good parasite doesn't destroy or even overtax its host.  We don't want to follow the sorry example of such unsuccessful species  as the bugs of bubonic plague or typhoid; we'll do better to model  ourselves on the humble tapeworm.\n\n\n \"Your idea is dangerous for the same reason. The monsters probably  spend thousands of years in interstellar space; during that time  they'll be living exclusively on their fat\u2014the fuel they stored on  Earth, and so will we. We've got a whole new history of man ahead  of us, under such changed conditions that we can't begin to predict  what turns it may take. There's a very great danger that men will  proliferate until they kill their hosts. But imagine a struggle for Lebensraum when all the living space there is is a few thousand  monsters capable of supporting a very limited number of people  each\u2014with your method giving an easy way to destroy these little  worlds our descendants will inhabit. It's too much dynamite to have  around the house.\"\n\n\n Westover bowed his head, but he had caught a curiously expectant glint  in Sutton's eyes as he spoke. He thought, and his face lightened.  \"Suppose we work out a way to record my idea, one that can't be  deciphered by anyone unintelligent enough to be likely to misuse it. A  riddle for our descendants\u2014who should have use for it some day.\"\n\n\n At last Sutton smiled. \"That's better. You've thought it through to  the end, I see.... This phase of our history won't last forever.  Eventually, the monsters will come to another planet not too unlike  Earth, because it's on such worlds they prey. A tapeworm can cross the  Sahara desert in the intestine of a camel\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice was drowned in a vast hissing roar. An irresistible pressure  distorted the walls of the chamber and scythed its occupants from their  feet. Sutton staggered drunkenly almost erect, fought his way across  the tilting floor to make sure of his precious apparatus. He turned  back toward the others, bracing himself and shouting something; then,  knowing his words lost in the thunder, gestured toward the Earth they  were leaving, a half-regretful, half-triumphant farewell. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nBased on the information in the passage, will Westover be remembered by other humans, and if he will, what will be his legacy?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He'll be remembered as the man who discovered that humans can eat the monsters for sustenance\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He'll eventually be remembered as the man who first knew the way to destroy the monsters\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He'll eventually be remembered as the man who first knew the way to destroy the monsters\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He'll eventually be remembered as the man who first knew the way to destroy the monsters\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

They gnawed\n\n at her soil, drank deep of her seas. Where, on\n\n this gutted cosmic carcass, could humanity flee?\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Westover got a shock when he stumbled onto the monster, for all that he  knew one had been through here.\n\n\n He had been following the high ground toward the hills, alternately  splashing through waist-deep water and climbing onto comparatively dry  knolls. To right and left of him was the sullen noise of the river in  flood, and behind him, too, the rising water he had barely escaped. The  night was overcast, the moon a faint disk of glow that left river and  hills and even the mud underfoot invisible.\n\n\n He had not sought in his mind for the flood's cause, but had merely  taken it numbly as part of the fury and confusion of a world in ruin.  Anyway, he was dead tired out on his feet.\n\n\n He sensed more than saw the looming wall before him, but he thought  it the bare ledge-rock of a stripped hillside until he stepped into a  small pot-hole and lurched forward, and his outflung hands sank into  the slime that covered a surface faintly, horrifyingly resilient.\n\n\n He recoiled as if seared, and retreated, slithering in the muck. For  moments his mind was full of dark formless panic; then he took a firm  hold on himself and tried to comprehend the situation.\n\n\n Nothing was distinguishable beyond a few yards, but his mind's eye  could see the rest\u2014the immense slug-like shape that extended in  ponderous repose across the river valley, its head and tail spilling  over the hills on either side, five miles apart. The beast was  quiescent until morning\u2014sleeping, if such things slept.\n\n\n And that explained the flood; the monster's body had formed an  unbreakable dam behind which the river had been steadily piling up in  those first hours of night; if it did not move until dawn, the level  would be far higher then.\n\n\n Westover stood motionless in the blackness; how long, he did not know.  He was hardly aware of the water that covered his feet, crept over his  ankles, and swirled halfway to his knees. Only the emergence of the  moon through a rift of the cloud blanket brought him awake; its dim  light gleamed all around on a great sheet of water, unbroken save for  scattered black hummocks\u2014crests of knolls like that on which he stood,  all soon to be hidden by the rising flood.\n\n\n For a moment he knew despair. The way back was impassable, and the way  ahead was blocked by the titanic enemy.\n\n\n Then the impersonal will that had driven him implacably two days and  nights without stopping came to his rescue. Westover plodded forward,  pressed his shrinking body against the slimy, faintly warm surface of  the monster's foot, and sought above him with upstretched hands\u2014found  holds, and began to climb with a strength he had not known was left in  him.\n\n\n The moonlight's fading again was merciful as he climbed the sheer,  slippery face of the foot; but he could hear the wash and chuckle of  the flood below. His tired brain told him treacherously: \"I'm already  asleep\u2014this is a nightmare.\" Once, listening to that insidious voice,  he slipped and for instants hung dizzily by his hands, and for some  minutes after he had found a new foothold merely clung panting with  pounding heart.\n\n\n Some time after he had found courage to resume the climb, he dragged  himself, gasping and quivering, to comparative safety on the broad  shelf that marked the rim of the foot. Above him lay the great black  steep that rose to the summit of the monster's humped back, a mountain  to be climbed. Westover felt poignantly that his exhausted body could  not make that ascent and face the long and dangerous descent beyond,  which he had to make before dawn ... but not now ... not now.... He lay in a state between waking and dreaming, high on the monster's  side; and it seemed that the colossal body moved, swelling and  sighing\u2014but he knew they did not breathe as backboned animals do.  Westover had been one of the men who, in the days when humanity was  still fighting, had accumulated quite a store of knowledge about the  enemy\u2014the enemy that was brainless and toolless, but that was simply  too vast for human intelligence and weapons to defeat....\n\n\n Westover no longer saw the murky moonlight, the far faint glitter of  the flood or the slope of the living mountain. He saw, as he had seen  from a circling jet plane, an immense tree of smoke that rose and  expanded under the noonday sun, creamy white above and black and oily  below, and beneath the black cloud something that writhed and flowed  sluggishly in a cyclopean death agony.\n\n\n That picture dissolved, and was replaced by the face of a man\u2014one who  might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated  planet. It was an ordinary face, roundish, spectacled, but etched now  by tragedy; the voice that went with it was flat, unemotional, pedantic.\n\n\n \"There are so many of them, and we've destroyed so few\u2014and to kill  those few took our mightiest weapons. Examination of the ones that have  been killed discloses the reason why ordinary projectiles and bombs and  poisons are ineffective against them\u2014apart, that is, from the chief  reason of sheer size. The creatures are so loosely organized that a  local injury hardly affects the whole. In a sense, each one of them is  a single cell\u2014like the slime molds, the Earthly life forms that most  resemble them.\n\n\n \"That striking resemblance, together with the fact that they chose  Earth to attack out of all the planets of the Solar System, shows they  must have originated on a world much like this. But while on Earth the  slime molds are the highest reticular organisms, and the dominant life  is all multicellular, on the monsters' home world conditions must have  favored unicellular growth. Probably as a result of this unspecialized  structure, the monsters have attained their great size and perhaps for  the same reason they have achieved what even intelligent cellular life  so far hasn't\u2014liberation from existence bound to one world's surface,  the conquest of space. They accomplished it not by invention but by  adaptation, as brainless life once crawled out of the sea to conquer  the dry land.\n\n\n \"The monsters who have descended on Earth must represent the end result  of a long evolution completed in space itself. They are evidently  deep-space beings, able to propel themselves from planet to planet and  from star to star in search of food, guided by instinct to suns and  worlds like ours. Descending on such a planet, they move across its  surface systematically ingesting all edible material\u2014all life not  mobile enough to avoid their march. They are like caterpillars that  overrun a planet and strip it of its leaves, before moving on to the  next.\n\n\n \"Man is a highly mobile species, so our direct casualties of this  invasion have been very light and will continue to be. But when the  monsters have finished with Earth, there will be no vegetation left  for man's food, no houses, no cities, none of the fixed installations  of civilization, and the end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured by the monsters.\" Westover awoke, feeling himself bathed by the cold sweat of  nightmare\u2014then he realized that a misty rain had wetted his face and  sogged his clothes. That, and the sleep he had had, refreshed him and  made his mind clearer than it had been for days, and he remembered that  he could not sleep but had to go on, searching with a hope that would  not die for some miraculously spared refuge where civilization and  science might yet exist, where there would be the means to realize his  idea for stopping the monsters.\n\n\n He sat up, eyes searching the sky for a sign to tell him how long he  had slept. Low on the western horizon he found the faint glow that told  of the moon's setting; and in the east a stronger light was already  struggling through the clouds and mist, becoming every moment less  tenuous and illusory, more the bitter reality of the breaking day.\n\n\n Even as Westover began frantically climbing, out of that lightening  sky the hopelessness of his effort pressed down on him. With dawn the  monster would begin to move, to crawl eastward impelled by the same dim  phototropic urge which must guide these things out of the interstellar  depths to Sun-type stars. All of them had crept endlessly eastward  around the Earth, gutting the continents and churning the sea bottoms,  and by now whatever was left of human civilization must be starving  beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships at sea. The hordes that  still lived and wandered over the once populous fertile lands, like  this\u2014would not live long.\n\n\n For a man like Westover, who had been a scientist, it was not the  prospect of death that was most crushing, but the death blow to his  human pride, the star-storming pride of mind and will\u2014defeated by  sheer bulk and mindless hunger.\n\n\n Near the crest of the monster's back, he stumbled and fell hands and  knees on the shagreen-roughness of the skin; at first he thought only  that an attack of dizziness had made him fall, then he realized that  the surface beneath him had shifted. Unmistakably even in the misty  dawn-light, the hills and valleys of the rugose back were changing  shape, as the vast protoplasmic mass below crawled, flowed beneath its  integument. In slow peristaltic motion the waves marched eastward,  toward the monster's head.\n\n\n He could stay where he was unharmed, of course. On the monster's back,  of all places, he had nothing to fear from it or from others of its  kind. But he knew with desperate clarity that by nightfall, when the  beast became still once more, exhaustion and growing hunger would have  made him unable to descend. As he lay where he had fallen, he felt that  weakness creeping over him, no longer held in check by the will that  had kept him doggedly plodding forward.\n\n\n Again he lay half conscious, in a lethargy that unchecked must grow  steadily deeper until death. Isolated thoughts floated through his  head. It occurred to him that he was now ideally located to conduct  the experiments necessary to prove his theory of how to destroy the  monsters\u2014if only someone had had the foresight to build a biological  laboratory on the monster's back. Of course the rolling motion would  create special problems of technique.... Idiocy.... Once more he seemed  to glimpse Sutton's face, as the biologist calmly made that grisly  report to the President's Committee on Extermination.... Sutton's  prediction had been a hundred percent correct. The monsters' hunger  knew no halt until they had absorbed into themselves all the organic  material on the world which was their prey.... And men must starve, as  he was starving now.... With a struggle Westover roused himself, first sitting up, then swaying  to his feet, frowning with the effort to look sanely at the terrible  inspiration that had come to him. The cloud blanket was breaking up,  the sun already high, beating down on the naked moving plateau on which  the man stood. The idea born in him seemed to stand that light, even to  expand into hope.\n\n\n Fingers shaking, he unhitched the light ax from his belt and began to  hack with feverish industry at the monster's crusted hide.\n\n\n The scaly, weathered epidermis seemed immeasurably thick. But at last  he had chopped through it, reached the softer protoplasm beneath.  Clawing and hewing in the hole he had made, he tore out heavy slabs of  the monster's flesh.\n\n\n A ripple that did not belong to the crawling motion ran over the  thing's surface round about. Westover laughed wildly with a sudden  sense of power. He, the insignificant human mite, had made the  miles-long beast twitch like a flea-bitten dog.\n\n\n The analogy was pat; like a flea, he had lodged on a larger animal and  was about to nourish himself from it. The slabs of flesh he had cut off  were gray and unappetizing, but he knew from the studies he had helped  Sutton make that the monsters, extraterrestrial though they were, were  in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates one with man  or the amoeba, and therefore might be\u2014food.\n\n\n His matches were dry in their water-proof case; he made a smoldering  fire from the loose fibrous scale of the monster's back, and half an  hour later was replete. Either the long fast, or involuntary revulsion,  or perhaps merely the motion of the creature brought on nausea, but he  fought it sternly back and succeeded in keeping his strange meal down.  Then he was tormented by thirst. It was some time, though, before he  could bring himself to drink the colorless fluid that had collected in  the wound he had inflicted on the monster.\n\n\n Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea  on a dog. The monster crawled by day and rested by night; strengthened,  the man could have left it then, but somehow night after night he did  not. It wasn't, he argued with himself sometimes in the days when he  lay torpidly drowsing, lulled by the long sway, arms over his head to  protect him from the sun's baking, merely that he was chained to the  only source of food he knew in all the world\u2014not just that he was  developing a flea's psychology. He was a man and a scientist, and he  was conducting an experiment.... His life on the monster's back was  proving something, something of vast importance for man, the extinct  animal\u2014but for increasingly longer periods of time he could not  remember what it was....\n\n\n There came a morning, though, when he remembered. Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog. He woke with the sun's warmth on his body and the realization of  something amiss trickling through his head. It was a little while  before he recognized the wrongness, and when he did he sat bolt upright.\n\n\n The sun was already up, and the monster should have begun once more its  steady, ravenous march to the east. But there was no motion; the great  living expanse lay still around him. He wondered wildly if it was dead.\n\n\n Presently, though, he felt a faint shuddering and lift beneath his  feet, and heard far stifled mutterings and sighs.\n\n\n Westover's mind was beginning to function again; it was as though the  cessation of the rock and sway had exorcised the lethargy that had lain  upon him. He knew now that he had been almost insane for the time he  had passed here, touched by the madness that takes hermits and men lost  in deserts or oceans. And his was a stranger solitude than any of those.\n\n\n Now he listened strainingly to the portentous sounds of change in the  monster's vitals, and in a flash of insight knew them for what they  were. The scientists had found, in the burst bodies of the Titans  that had been killed by atomic bombs, the answer to the riddle of  these creatures' crossing of space: great vacuoles, pockets of gas  that in the living animal could be under exceedingly high pressures,  and that could be expelled to drive the monster in flight like a  reaction engine. Rocket propulsion, of course, was nothing new to  zoology; it was developed ages before man, by the squids and by those  odd degenerate relatives of the vertebrates that are called tunicates  because of their gaudy cellulose-plastic armor....\n\n\n The monster on which Westover had been living as a parasite was  generating gases within itself, preparing to leave the ravished Earth.  That was the meaning of its gargantuan belly rumblings. And they meant  further that he must finally leave it\u2014now or never\u2014or be borne aloft  to die gasping in the stratosphere.\n\n\n Hurriedly the man scrambled to the highest eminence of the back and  stood looking about; and what he saw brought him to the brink of  despair. For all around lay blue water, waves dancing and glinting in  the fresh breeze; and sniffing the air he recognized the salt tang  of the sea. While he slept the monster had crept beyond the coast  line, and lay now in what to it was shallow water\u2014fifty or a hundred  fathoms. Back the way it had come, a headland was visible, mockingly,  hopelessly distant.\n\n\n Of course\u2014the great beast would crawl into the sea, which would float  its bloated bulk and enable it to accelerate and take flight. It would  never have been able to lift itself into the air from the dry land.\n\n\n He should have foreseen that and made his escape in time. Now that  he had solved the problem of human survival.... But the bright ocean  laughed at him, sparkling away wave beyond rolling wave, and beyond  that blue headland could be only a land made desert, where men become  beasts fought crazily over the last morsels of food. He had lost track  of the days he had been on the monster's back, but the rape of Earth  must be finished now. He had no doubt that the things would depart  as they had come into the Solar System\u2014in that close, seemingly  one-willed swarm that Earth's astronomers had at first taken for a  comet. If this one was leaving, the rest no doubt were too.\n\n\n Westover sat for a space with head in hands, hearing the faint  continuing murmurs from below. And he remembered the voices. He had been hearing them again as he awoke\u2014the distant muffled voices  whose words he could not make out, not the small close ones that  sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even  called his name. The latter had to be, as he had vaguely accepted them  even then, illusions\u2014but the others\u2014with his new clarity he was  suddenly sure that they had been real.\n\n\n And a wild, white light of hope blazed in him, and he flung himself  flat on the rough surface, beat on it with bare fists and shouted:  \"Help! Here I am! Help!\"\n\n\n He paused to listen with fierce intentness, and heard nothing but the  faint eructations deep inside the monster.\n\n\n Then he sprang to his feet, gripping his hand-ax, and ran panting to  the place where he had dug for food. His excavations tended to close  and heal overnight; now he went to work with vicious strokes enlarging  the latest one, hacking and tearing it deeper and deeper.\n\n\n He was almost hidden in the cavity when a shadow fell across him from  behind. He whirled, for there could be no shadows on the monster's back.\n\n\n A man stood watching him calmly\u2014an elderly man in rusty black  clothing, leaning on a stick. The staff, the snowy beard, and something  that smoldered behind the benign eyes, gave him the look of an ancient  prophet.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" asked Westover, breathlessly but almost without surprise.\n\n\n \"I am the Preacher,\" the old man said. \"The Lord hath sent me to save  you. Arise, my son, and follow me.\"\n\n\n Westover hesitated. \"I'm not just imagining you?\" he appealed.  \"Somebody else has really found the answer?\"\n\n\n The Preacher's brows knitted faintly, but then his look turned to  benevolent understanding. \"You have been alone too long here. Come with  me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor.\"\n\n\n Westover was still not sure that the other was more than one of the  powerful specters of childhood\u2014the Preacher, the Doctor, no doubt the  Teacher next\u2014risen to rob him of his last shreds of sanity. But he  nodded in childlike obedience, and followed.\n\n\n When, a few hundred yards nearer the monster's head, the other halted  at a black rent in the rugose hide, the mouth of a burrow descending  into utter blackness\u2014Westover knew that both the Preacher and his own  wild hope were real.\n\n\n \"Down here. Into the belly of Leviathan,\" said the old man solemnly,  and Westover nodded this time with alacrity. The crawling descent through the twisting, Stygian burrow had much  that ought to belong to a journey into Hell.... More than that, no  demonologist's imagination could have conceived without experiencing  the sheer horror of the yielding beslimed walls that seemed every  moment squeezing in to trap them unspeakably. The air was warm and  rank with the familiar heavy sweetish odor of the monster's colorless  blood....\n\n\n Then, as he knew it must, a light glimmered ahead, the sinus widened,  and Westover climbed to his feet and stood, weak-kneed still, staring  at a chamber carved in the veritable belly of Leviathan. The floor  underfoot was firm, as was the wall his shaking fingers tested.  Dazzled, he saw tools leaning against the walls, spades, crowbars,  axes, and a half-dozen people, men and women in rough grimy clothing,  who stood watching him with lively interest.\n\n\n The Preacher stood beside him, breathing hard and mopping his forehead.  But he brushed aside the deferential offers of the others: \"No\u2014I will  take him to the Doctor myself. All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"\n\n\n There was another tunnel to be crawled through, but that one was  firm-walled as the room they left behind. They emerged into a larger  cavern, that like the first was lit\u2014only now did the miracle of it  obtrude itself in his dazed mind\u2014by fluorescent tubes, and filled with  equipment that gleamed glass and metal. Over an apparatus with many  fluid-dripping trays, like an air-conditioning device, bent a lone man.\n\n\n \"Is it working?\" inquired the Preacher.\n\n\n \"It's working,\" the other answered without looking up from the  adjustment he was making. Bubbles were rising in the fluid that filled  the trays, rising and bursting, rising and bursting with a curiously  fascinating monotony. The subtly tense attitudes of the two initiates  told Westover better than words that there was something hugely  important in the success of whatever magic was producing those bubbles.\n\n\n The thaumaturge straightened, wiping his hands on his trousers as he  turned with a satisfied grin on his round, spectacled face\u2014then both  he and Westover froze in dumbfounded recognition. Sutton was first to recover. He said quietly, \"Welcome aboard the ark,  Bill. You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\" His  quick eyes studied Westover's face, and he gestured toward a packing  box against the wall opposite his apparatus. \"Sit down. You've been  through the mill.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Westover sat down dizzily. \"I've been aboard your ark  for some time now, though. Only as an ectoparasite.\"\n\n\n \"It's high time you joined the endoparasites. Lucky you scratched  around enough up there to create repercussions we could feel down here.  You got the same idea, then?\"\n\n\n \"I stumbled onto it,\" Westover admitted. \"I was wandering across  country\u2014my plane crashed on the way back from that South American  bug hunt dreamed up by somebody who'd been reading Wells' War of the  Worlds . I think my pilot went nuts; you could see too much of the  destruction from up there.... But I got out in one piece and started  walking\u2014looking for some place with people and facilities that could  try out my method of killing the monsters. I thought\u2014I still think\u2014I  had a sure-fire way to do that\u2014but I didn't realize then that it was  too late to think of killing them off.\"\n\n\n Sutton nodded thoughtfully. \"It was too late\u2014or too early, perhaps.  We'll have to talk that over.\"\n\n\n Westover finished the brief account of his coming to dwell on the  monster's back. The other grinned happily.\n\n\n \"You began with the practice, where I worked out the theory first.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got so far with the theory,\" said Westover, \"but I think  I've got the main outlines. Until the monsters came, man was a parasite  on the face of the Earth. Fundamentally, parasitism\u2014on the green  plants and their by-products\u2014was our way of life, as of all animals  from the beginning. But the monsters absorbed into themselves all the  plant food and even the organic material in the soil. So we have only  one way out\u2014to transfer our parasitism to the only remaining food  source\u2014the monsters themselves.\n\n\n \"The monsters almost defeated us, because of their two special  adaptations of extreme size and ability to cross space. But man has  always won the battle of adaptations before, because he could improvise  new ones as the need arose. The greatest crisis humanity ever faced  called for the most radical innovation in our way of life.\"\n\n\n \"Very well put,\" approved Sutton. \"Except that you make it sound easy.  By the time I'd worked it out like that, things were already in  such a turmoil that putting it into effect was the devil's own job.  About the only ones I could find to help me were the Preacher and his  people. They have the faith that moves mountains, that has made this  self-moving mountain inhabitable.\"\n\n\n \"It is inhabitable?\" Westover's question reflected no doubt. Sutton gestured at the bubbling device behind him. \"That thing is  making air now, which we're going to need when the monster's in space.  It was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I  hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2014that's  its blood flowing through the filters. We've got an electric generator  running by tapping the monster's internal gas pressure. There are  problems left before we'll be fully self-sufficient here\u2014but the  monster is so much like us in fundamental makeup that its body contains  all the elements human life needs too.\"\n\n\n \"Then,\" Westover glanced appreciatively around, \"it looks like the main  hazard is claustrophobia.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about a cave-in. We're surrounded by solid cystoid  tissue. But,\" Sutton's voice took on a graver note, \"there may be  other psychological dangers. I don't think all our people\u2014there are  fifty-one, fifty-two of us now\u2014realize yet that this colony isn't just  a temporary expedient. Human history hasn't had such a turning-point  since men first started chipping stone. Spengler's Mensch als  Raubtier \u2014if he ever existed\u2014has to be replaced by the Mensch als  Schmarotzer , and the adjustment may come hard. We've got to plan  for the rest of our lives\u2014and our children's and our children's  children's\u2014as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can  manage to\u2014infect\u2014when they're clustered again in space.\"\n\n\n \"For the future,\" put in the Preacher, who had watched benignly the  biologists' reunion, \"the Lord will provide, even as He did unto Jonah  when he cried to Him out of the belly of the fish.\"\n\n\n \"Amen,\" agreed Sutton. But the gaze he fixed on Westover was oddly  troubled. \"Speaking of the future brings up the question of the idea  you mentioned\u2014your monster-killing scheme.\" Westover flexed his hands involuntarily, like one who has been too  long enforcedly idle. In terse eager sentences he outlined for Sutton  the plan that had burned in him during his bitter wandering over  the face of the ruined land. It would be very easy to accomplish  from an endoparasite's point of vantage, merely by isolating from  the creature's blood over a long period enough of some potent  secretion\u2014hormone, enzyme or the like\u2014to kill when suddenly  reintroduced into the system. \"Originally I thought we could accomplish  the same thing by synthesis\u2014but this way will be simpler.\"\n\n\n \"Beautifully simple.\" Sutton smiled wryly. \"So much so that I wish  you'd never thought of it.\"\n\n\n Westover stared. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Describing your plan, you sounded almost ready to put it into effect  on the spot.\"\n\n\n \"No! Of course I realize\u2014Well, I see what you mean\u2014I think.\" Westover  was crestfallen.\n\n\n Sutton smiled faintly.\n\n\n \"I think you do, Bill. To survive, we've got to be good parasites.  That means before all, for the coming generations, that we keep our  numbers down. A good parasite doesn't destroy or even overtax its host.  We don't want to follow the sorry example of such unsuccessful species  as the bugs of bubonic plague or typhoid; we'll do better to model  ourselves on the humble tapeworm.\n\n\n \"Your idea is dangerous for the same reason. The monsters probably  spend thousands of years in interstellar space; during that time  they'll be living exclusively on their fat\u2014the fuel they stored on  Earth, and so will we. We've got a whole new history of man ahead  of us, under such changed conditions that we can't begin to predict  what turns it may take. There's a very great danger that men will  proliferate until they kill their hosts. But imagine a struggle for Lebensraum when all the living space there is is a few thousand  monsters capable of supporting a very limited number of people  each\u2014with your method giving an easy way to destroy these little  worlds our descendants will inhabit. It's too much dynamite to have  around the house.\"\n\n\n Westover bowed his head, but he had caught a curiously expectant glint  in Sutton's eyes as he spoke. He thought, and his face lightened.  \"Suppose we work out a way to record my idea, one that can't be  deciphered by anyone unintelligent enough to be likely to misuse it. A  riddle for our descendants\u2014who should have use for it some day.\"\n\n\n At last Sutton smiled. \"That's better. You've thought it through to  the end, I see.... This phase of our history won't last forever.  Eventually, the monsters will come to another planet not too unlike  Earth, because it's on such worlds they prey. A tapeworm can cross the  Sahara desert in the intestine of a camel\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice was drowned in a vast hissing roar. An irresistible pressure  distorted the walls of the chamber and scythed its occupants from their  feet. Sutton staggered drunkenly almost erect, fought his way across  the tilting floor to make sure of his precious apparatus. He turned  back toward the others, bracing himself and shouting something; then,  knowing his words lost in the thunder, gestured toward the Earth they  were leaving, a half-regretful, half-triumphant farewell. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nBased on the information in the passage, will Westover be remembered by other humans, and if he will, what will be his legacy?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He'll eventually be remembered as the man who first knew the way to destroy the monsters\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He'll be remembered as the man who discovered that humans can eat the monsters for sustenance\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He'll be remembered as the man who discovered that humans can eat the monsters for sustenance\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He'll be remembered as the man who discovered that humans can eat the monsters for sustenance\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "I.

They gnawed\n\n at her soil, drank deep of her seas. Where, on\n\n this gutted cosmic carcass, could humanity flee?\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Westover got a shock when he stumbled onto the monster, for all that he  knew one had been through here.\n\n\n He had been following the high ground toward the hills, alternately  splashing through waist-deep water and climbing onto comparatively dry  knolls. To right and left of him was the sullen noise of the river in  flood, and behind him, too, the rising water he had barely escaped. The  night was overcast, the moon a faint disk of glow that left river and  hills and even the mud underfoot invisible.\n\n\n He had not sought in his mind for the flood's cause, but had merely  taken it numbly as part of the fury and confusion of a world in ruin.  Anyway, he was dead tired out on his feet.\n\n\n He sensed more than saw the looming wall before him, but he thought  it the bare ledge-rock of a stripped hillside until he stepped into a  small pot-hole and lurched forward, and his outflung hands sank into  the slime that covered a surface faintly, horrifyingly resilient.\n\n\n He recoiled as if seared, and retreated, slithering in the muck. For  moments his mind was full of dark formless panic; then he took a firm  hold on himself and tried to comprehend the situation.\n\n\n Nothing was distinguishable beyond a few yards, but his mind's eye  could see the rest\u2014the immense slug-like shape that extended in  ponderous repose across the river valley, its head and tail spilling  over the hills on either side, five miles apart. The beast was  quiescent until morning\u2014sleeping, if such things slept.\n\n\n And that explained the flood; the monster's body had formed an  unbreakable dam behind which the river had been steadily piling up in  those first hours of night; if it did not move until dawn, the level  would be far higher then.\n\n\n Westover stood motionless in the blackness; how long, he did not know.  He was hardly aware of the water that covered his feet, crept over his  ankles, and swirled halfway to his knees. Only the emergence of the  moon through a rift of the cloud blanket brought him awake; its dim  light gleamed all around on a great sheet of water, unbroken save for  scattered black hummocks\u2014crests of knolls like that on which he stood,  all soon to be hidden by the rising flood.\n\n\n For a moment he knew despair. The way back was impassable, and the way  ahead was blocked by the titanic enemy.\n\n\n Then the impersonal will that had driven him implacably two days and  nights without stopping came to his rescue. Westover plodded forward,  pressed his shrinking body against the slimy, faintly warm surface of  the monster's foot, and sought above him with upstretched hands\u2014found  holds, and began to climb with a strength he had not known was left in  him.\n\n\n The moonlight's fading again was merciful as he climbed the sheer,  slippery face of the foot; but he could hear the wash and chuckle of  the flood below. His tired brain told him treacherously: \"I'm already  asleep\u2014this is a nightmare.\" Once, listening to that insidious voice,  he slipped and for instants hung dizzily by his hands, and for some  minutes after he had found a new foothold merely clung panting with  pounding heart.\n\n\n Some time after he had found courage to resume the climb, he dragged  himself, gasping and quivering, to comparative safety on the broad  shelf that marked the rim of the foot. Above him lay the great black  steep that rose to the summit of the monster's humped back, a mountain  to be climbed. Westover felt poignantly that his exhausted body could  not make that ascent and face the long and dangerous descent beyond,  which he had to make before dawn ... but not now ... not now.... He lay in a state between waking and dreaming, high on the monster's  side; and it seemed that the colossal body moved, swelling and  sighing\u2014but he knew they did not breathe as backboned animals do.  Westover had been one of the men who, in the days when humanity was  still fighting, had accumulated quite a store of knowledge about the  enemy\u2014the enemy that was brainless and toolless, but that was simply  too vast for human intelligence and weapons to defeat....\n\n\n Westover no longer saw the murky moonlight, the far faint glitter of  the flood or the slope of the living mountain. He saw, as he had seen  from a circling jet plane, an immense tree of smoke that rose and  expanded under the noonday sun, creamy white above and black and oily  below, and beneath the black cloud something that writhed and flowed  sluggishly in a cyclopean death agony.\n\n\n That picture dissolved, and was replaced by the face of a man\u2014one who  might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated  planet. It was an ordinary face, roundish, spectacled, but etched now  by tragedy; the voice that went with it was flat, unemotional, pedantic.\n\n\n \"There are so many of them, and we've destroyed so few\u2014and to kill  those few took our mightiest weapons. Examination of the ones that have  been killed discloses the reason why ordinary projectiles and bombs and  poisons are ineffective against them\u2014apart, that is, from the chief  reason of sheer size. The creatures are so loosely organized that a  local injury hardly affects the whole. In a sense, each one of them is  a single cell\u2014like the slime molds, the Earthly life forms that most  resemble them.\n\n\n \"That striking resemblance, together with the fact that they chose  Earth to attack out of all the planets of the Solar System, shows they  must have originated on a world much like this. But while on Earth the  slime molds are the highest reticular organisms, and the dominant life  is all multicellular, on the monsters' home world conditions must have  favored unicellular growth. Probably as a result of this unspecialized  structure, the monsters have attained their great size and perhaps for  the same reason they have achieved what even intelligent cellular life  so far hasn't\u2014liberation from existence bound to one world's surface,  the conquest of space. They accomplished it not by invention but by  adaptation, as brainless life once crawled out of the sea to conquer  the dry land.\n\n\n \"The monsters who have descended on Earth must represent the end result  of a long evolution completed in space itself. They are evidently  deep-space beings, able to propel themselves from planet to planet and  from star to star in search of food, guided by instinct to suns and  worlds like ours. Descending on such a planet, they move across its  surface systematically ingesting all edible material\u2014all life not  mobile enough to avoid their march. They are like caterpillars that  overrun a planet and strip it of its leaves, before moving on to the  next.\n\n\n \"Man is a highly mobile species, so our direct casualties of this  invasion have been very light and will continue to be. But when the  monsters have finished with Earth, there will be no vegetation left  for man's food, no houses, no cities, none of the fixed installations  of civilization, and the end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured by the monsters.\" Westover awoke, feeling himself bathed by the cold sweat of  nightmare\u2014then he realized that a misty rain had wetted his face and  sogged his clothes. That, and the sleep he had had, refreshed him and  made his mind clearer than it had been for days, and he remembered that  he could not sleep but had to go on, searching with a hope that would  not die for some miraculously spared refuge where civilization and  science might yet exist, where there would be the means to realize his  idea for stopping the monsters.\n\n\n He sat up, eyes searching the sky for a sign to tell him how long he  had slept. Low on the western horizon he found the faint glow that told  of the moon's setting; and in the east a stronger light was already  struggling through the clouds and mist, becoming every moment less  tenuous and illusory, more the bitter reality of the breaking day.\n\n\n Even as Westover began frantically climbing, out of that lightening  sky the hopelessness of his effort pressed down on him. With dawn the  monster would begin to move, to crawl eastward impelled by the same dim  phototropic urge which must guide these things out of the interstellar  depths to Sun-type stars. All of them had crept endlessly eastward  around the Earth, gutting the continents and churning the sea bottoms,  and by now whatever was left of human civilization must be starving  beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships at sea. The hordes that  still lived and wandered over the once populous fertile lands, like  this\u2014would not live long.\n\n\n For a man like Westover, who had been a scientist, it was not the  prospect of death that was most crushing, but the death blow to his  human pride, the star-storming pride of mind and will\u2014defeated by  sheer bulk and mindless hunger.\n\n\n Near the crest of the monster's back, he stumbled and fell hands and  knees on the shagreen-roughness of the skin; at first he thought only  that an attack of dizziness had made him fall, then he realized that  the surface beneath him had shifted. Unmistakably even in the misty  dawn-light, the hills and valleys of the rugose back were changing  shape, as the vast protoplasmic mass below crawled, flowed beneath its  integument. In slow peristaltic motion the waves marched eastward,  toward the monster's head.\n\n\n He could stay where he was unharmed, of course. On the monster's back,  of all places, he had nothing to fear from it or from others of its  kind. But he knew with desperate clarity that by nightfall, when the  beast became still once more, exhaustion and growing hunger would have  made him unable to descend. As he lay where he had fallen, he felt that  weakness creeping over him, no longer held in check by the will that  had kept him doggedly plodding forward.\n\n\n Again he lay half conscious, in a lethargy that unchecked must grow  steadily deeper until death. Isolated thoughts floated through his  head. It occurred to him that he was now ideally located to conduct  the experiments necessary to prove his theory of how to destroy the  monsters\u2014if only someone had had the foresight to build a biological  laboratory on the monster's back. Of course the rolling motion would  create special problems of technique.... Idiocy.... Once more he seemed  to glimpse Sutton's face, as the biologist calmly made that grisly  report to the President's Committee on Extermination.... Sutton's  prediction had been a hundred percent correct. The monsters' hunger  knew no halt until they had absorbed into themselves all the organic  material on the world which was their prey.... And men must starve, as  he was starving now.... With a struggle Westover roused himself, first sitting up, then swaying  to his feet, frowning with the effort to look sanely at the terrible  inspiration that had come to him. The cloud blanket was breaking up,  the sun already high, beating down on the naked moving plateau on which  the man stood. The idea born in him seemed to stand that light, even to  expand into hope.\n\n\n Fingers shaking, he unhitched the light ax from his belt and began to  hack with feverish industry at the monster's crusted hide.\n\n\n The scaly, weathered epidermis seemed immeasurably thick. But at last  he had chopped through it, reached the softer protoplasm beneath.  Clawing and hewing in the hole he had made, he tore out heavy slabs of  the monster's flesh.\n\n\n A ripple that did not belong to the crawling motion ran over the  thing's surface round about. Westover laughed wildly with a sudden  sense of power. He, the insignificant human mite, had made the  miles-long beast twitch like a flea-bitten dog.\n\n\n The analogy was pat; like a flea, he had lodged on a larger animal and  was about to nourish himself from it. The slabs of flesh he had cut off  were gray and unappetizing, but he knew from the studies he had helped  Sutton make that the monsters, extraterrestrial though they were, were  in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates one with man  or the amoeba, and therefore might be\u2014food.\n\n\n His matches were dry in their water-proof case; he made a smoldering  fire from the loose fibrous scale of the monster's back, and half an  hour later was replete. Either the long fast, or involuntary revulsion,  or perhaps merely the motion of the creature brought on nausea, but he  fought it sternly back and succeeded in keeping his strange meal down.  Then he was tormented by thirst. It was some time, though, before he  could bring himself to drink the colorless fluid that had collected in  the wound he had inflicted on the monster.\n\n\n Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea  on a dog. The monster crawled by day and rested by night; strengthened,  the man could have left it then, but somehow night after night he did  not. It wasn't, he argued with himself sometimes in the days when he  lay torpidly drowsing, lulled by the long sway, arms over his head to  protect him from the sun's baking, merely that he was chained to the  only source of food he knew in all the world\u2014not just that he was  developing a flea's psychology. He was a man and a scientist, and he  was conducting an experiment.... His life on the monster's back was  proving something, something of vast importance for man, the extinct  animal\u2014but for increasingly longer periods of time he could not  remember what it was....\n\n\n There came a morning, though, when he remembered. Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog. He woke with the sun's warmth on his body and the realization of  something amiss trickling through his head. It was a little while  before he recognized the wrongness, and when he did he sat bolt upright.\n\n\n The sun was already up, and the monster should have begun once more its  steady, ravenous march to the east. But there was no motion; the great  living expanse lay still around him. He wondered wildly if it was dead.\n\n\n Presently, though, he felt a faint shuddering and lift beneath his  feet, and heard far stifled mutterings and sighs.\n\n\n Westover's mind was beginning to function again; it was as though the  cessation of the rock and sway had exorcised the lethargy that had lain  upon him. He knew now that he had been almost insane for the time he  had passed here, touched by the madness that takes hermits and men lost  in deserts or oceans. And his was a stranger solitude than any of those.\n\n\n Now he listened strainingly to the portentous sounds of change in the  monster's vitals, and in a flash of insight knew them for what they  were. The scientists had found, in the burst bodies of the Titans  that had been killed by atomic bombs, the answer to the riddle of  these creatures' crossing of space: great vacuoles, pockets of gas  that in the living animal could be under exceedingly high pressures,  and that could be expelled to drive the monster in flight like a  reaction engine. Rocket propulsion, of course, was nothing new to  zoology; it was developed ages before man, by the squids and by those  odd degenerate relatives of the vertebrates that are called tunicates  because of their gaudy cellulose-plastic armor....\n\n\n The monster on which Westover had been living as a parasite was  generating gases within itself, preparing to leave the ravished Earth.  That was the meaning of its gargantuan belly rumblings. And they meant  further that he must finally leave it\u2014now or never\u2014or be borne aloft  to die gasping in the stratosphere.\n\n\n Hurriedly the man scrambled to the highest eminence of the back and  stood looking about; and what he saw brought him to the brink of  despair. For all around lay blue water, waves dancing and glinting in  the fresh breeze; and sniffing the air he recognized the salt tang  of the sea. While he slept the monster had crept beyond the coast  line, and lay now in what to it was shallow water\u2014fifty or a hundred  fathoms. Back the way it had come, a headland was visible, mockingly,  hopelessly distant.\n\n\n Of course\u2014the great beast would crawl into the sea, which would float  its bloated bulk and enable it to accelerate and take flight. It would  never have been able to lift itself into the air from the dry land.\n\n\n He should have foreseen that and made his escape in time. Now that  he had solved the problem of human survival.... But the bright ocean  laughed at him, sparkling away wave beyond rolling wave, and beyond  that blue headland could be only a land made desert, where men become  beasts fought crazily over the last morsels of food. He had lost track  of the days he had been on the monster's back, but the rape of Earth  must be finished now. He had no doubt that the things would depart  as they had come into the Solar System\u2014in that close, seemingly  one-willed swarm that Earth's astronomers had at first taken for a  comet. If this one was leaving, the rest no doubt were too.\n\n\n Westover sat for a space with head in hands, hearing the faint  continuing murmurs from below. And he remembered the voices. He had been hearing them again as he awoke\u2014the distant muffled voices  whose words he could not make out, not the small close ones that  sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even  called his name. The latter had to be, as he had vaguely accepted them  even then, illusions\u2014but the others\u2014with his new clarity he was  suddenly sure that they had been real.\n\n\n And a wild, white light of hope blazed in him, and he flung himself  flat on the rough surface, beat on it with bare fists and shouted:  \"Help! Here I am! Help!\"\n\n\n He paused to listen with fierce intentness, and heard nothing but the  faint eructations deep inside the monster.\n\n\n Then he sprang to his feet, gripping his hand-ax, and ran panting to  the place where he had dug for food. His excavations tended to close  and heal overnight; now he went to work with vicious strokes enlarging  the latest one, hacking and tearing it deeper and deeper.\n\n\n He was almost hidden in the cavity when a shadow fell across him from  behind. He whirled, for there could be no shadows on the monster's back.\n\n\n A man stood watching him calmly\u2014an elderly man in rusty black  clothing, leaning on a stick. The staff, the snowy beard, and something  that smoldered behind the benign eyes, gave him the look of an ancient  prophet.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" asked Westover, breathlessly but almost without surprise.\n\n\n \"I am the Preacher,\" the old man said. \"The Lord hath sent me to save  you. Arise, my son, and follow me.\"\n\n\n Westover hesitated. \"I'm not just imagining you?\" he appealed.  \"Somebody else has really found the answer?\"\n\n\n The Preacher's brows knitted faintly, but then his look turned to  benevolent understanding. \"You have been alone too long here. Come with  me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor.\"\n\n\n Westover was still not sure that the other was more than one of the  powerful specters of childhood\u2014the Preacher, the Doctor, no doubt the  Teacher next\u2014risen to rob him of his last shreds of sanity. But he  nodded in childlike obedience, and followed.\n\n\n When, a few hundred yards nearer the monster's head, the other halted  at a black rent in the rugose hide, the mouth of a burrow descending  into utter blackness\u2014Westover knew that both the Preacher and his own  wild hope were real.\n\n\n \"Down here. Into the belly of Leviathan,\" said the old man solemnly,  and Westover nodded this time with alacrity. The crawling descent through the twisting, Stygian burrow had much  that ought to belong to a journey into Hell.... More than that, no  demonologist's imagination could have conceived without experiencing  the sheer horror of the yielding beslimed walls that seemed every  moment squeezing in to trap them unspeakably. The air was warm and  rank with the familiar heavy sweetish odor of the monster's colorless  blood....\n\n\n Then, as he knew it must, a light glimmered ahead, the sinus widened,  and Westover climbed to his feet and stood, weak-kneed still, staring  at a chamber carved in the veritable belly of Leviathan. The floor  underfoot was firm, as was the wall his shaking fingers tested.  Dazzled, he saw tools leaning against the walls, spades, crowbars,  axes, and a half-dozen people, men and women in rough grimy clothing,  who stood watching him with lively interest.\n\n\n The Preacher stood beside him, breathing hard and mopping his forehead.  But he brushed aside the deferential offers of the others: \"No\u2014I will  take him to the Doctor myself. All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"\n\n\n There was another tunnel to be crawled through, but that one was  firm-walled as the room they left behind. They emerged into a larger  cavern, that like the first was lit\u2014only now did the miracle of it  obtrude itself in his dazed mind\u2014by fluorescent tubes, and filled with  equipment that gleamed glass and metal. Over an apparatus with many  fluid-dripping trays, like an air-conditioning device, bent a lone man.\n\n\n \"Is it working?\" inquired the Preacher.\n\n\n \"It's working,\" the other answered without looking up from the  adjustment he was making. Bubbles were rising in the fluid that filled  the trays, rising and bursting, rising and bursting with a curiously  fascinating monotony. The subtly tense attitudes of the two initiates  told Westover better than words that there was something hugely  important in the success of whatever magic was producing those bubbles.\n\n\n The thaumaturge straightened, wiping his hands on his trousers as he  turned with a satisfied grin on his round, spectacled face\u2014then both  he and Westover froze in dumbfounded recognition. Sutton was first to recover. He said quietly, \"Welcome aboard the ark,  Bill. You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\" His  quick eyes studied Westover's face, and he gestured toward a packing  box against the wall opposite his apparatus. \"Sit down. You've been  through the mill.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Westover sat down dizzily. \"I've been aboard your ark  for some time now, though. Only as an ectoparasite.\"\n\n\n \"It's high time you joined the endoparasites. Lucky you scratched  around enough up there to create repercussions we could feel down here.  You got the same idea, then?\"\n\n\n \"I stumbled onto it,\" Westover admitted. \"I was wandering across  country\u2014my plane crashed on the way back from that South American  bug hunt dreamed up by somebody who'd been reading Wells' War of the  Worlds . I think my pilot went nuts; you could see too much of the  destruction from up there.... But I got out in one piece and started  walking\u2014looking for some place with people and facilities that could  try out my method of killing the monsters. I thought\u2014I still think\u2014I  had a sure-fire way to do that\u2014but I didn't realize then that it was  too late to think of killing them off.\"\n\n\n Sutton nodded thoughtfully. \"It was too late\u2014or too early, perhaps.  We'll have to talk that over.\"\n\n\n Westover finished the brief account of his coming to dwell on the  monster's back. The other grinned happily.\n\n\n \"You began with the practice, where I worked out the theory first.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got so far with the theory,\" said Westover, \"but I think  I've got the main outlines. Until the monsters came, man was a parasite  on the face of the Earth. Fundamentally, parasitism\u2014on the green  plants and their by-products\u2014was our way of life, as of all animals  from the beginning. But the monsters absorbed into themselves all the  plant food and even the organic material in the soil. So we have only  one way out\u2014to transfer our parasitism to the only remaining food  source\u2014the monsters themselves.\n\n\n \"The monsters almost defeated us, because of their two special  adaptations of extreme size and ability to cross space. But man has  always won the battle of adaptations before, because he could improvise  new ones as the need arose. The greatest crisis humanity ever faced  called for the most radical innovation in our way of life.\"\n\n\n \"Very well put,\" approved Sutton. \"Except that you make it sound easy.  By the time I'd worked it out like that, things were already in  such a turmoil that putting it into effect was the devil's own job.  About the only ones I could find to help me were the Preacher and his  people. They have the faith that moves mountains, that has made this  self-moving mountain inhabitable.\"\n\n\n \"It is inhabitable?\" Westover's question reflected no doubt. Sutton gestured at the bubbling device behind him. \"That thing is  making air now, which we're going to need when the monster's in space.  It was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I  hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2014that's  its blood flowing through the filters. We've got an electric generator  running by tapping the monster's internal gas pressure. There are  problems left before we'll be fully self-sufficient here\u2014but the  monster is so much like us in fundamental makeup that its body contains  all the elements human life needs too.\"\n\n\n \"Then,\" Westover glanced appreciatively around, \"it looks like the main  hazard is claustrophobia.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about a cave-in. We're surrounded by solid cystoid  tissue. But,\" Sutton's voice took on a graver note, \"there may be  other psychological dangers. I don't think all our people\u2014there are  fifty-one, fifty-two of us now\u2014realize yet that this colony isn't just  a temporary expedient. Human history hasn't had such a turning-point  since men first started chipping stone. Spengler's Mensch als  Raubtier \u2014if he ever existed\u2014has to be replaced by the Mensch als  Schmarotzer , and the adjustment may come hard. We've got to plan  for the rest of our lives\u2014and our children's and our children's  children's\u2014as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can  manage to\u2014infect\u2014when they're clustered again in space.\"\n\n\n \"For the future,\" put in the Preacher, who had watched benignly the  biologists' reunion, \"the Lord will provide, even as He did unto Jonah  when he cried to Him out of the belly of the fish.\"\n\n\n \"Amen,\" agreed Sutton. But the gaze he fixed on Westover was oddly  troubled. \"Speaking of the future brings up the question of the idea  you mentioned\u2014your monster-killing scheme.\" Westover flexed his hands involuntarily, like one who has been too  long enforcedly idle. In terse eager sentences he outlined for Sutton  the plan that had burned in him during his bitter wandering over  the face of the ruined land. It would be very easy to accomplish  from an endoparasite's point of vantage, merely by isolating from  the creature's blood over a long period enough of some potent  secretion\u2014hormone, enzyme or the like\u2014to kill when suddenly  reintroduced into the system. \"Originally I thought we could accomplish  the same thing by synthesis\u2014but this way will be simpler.\"\n\n\n \"Beautifully simple.\" Sutton smiled wryly. \"So much so that I wish  you'd never thought of it.\"\n\n\n Westover stared. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Describing your plan, you sounded almost ready to put it into effect  on the spot.\"\n\n\n \"No! Of course I realize\u2014Well, I see what you mean\u2014I think.\" Westover  was crestfallen.\n\n\n Sutton smiled faintly.\n\n\n \"I think you do, Bill. To survive, we've got to be good parasites.  That means before all, for the coming generations, that we keep our  numbers down. A good parasite doesn't destroy or even overtax its host.  We don't want to follow the sorry example of such unsuccessful species  as the bugs of bubonic plague or typhoid; we'll do better to model  ourselves on the humble tapeworm.\n\n\n \"Your idea is dangerous for the same reason. The monsters probably  spend thousands of years in interstellar space; during that time  they'll be living exclusively on their fat\u2014the fuel they stored on  Earth, and so will we. We've got a whole new history of man ahead  of us, under such changed conditions that we can't begin to predict  what turns it may take. There's a very great danger that men will  proliferate until they kill their hosts. But imagine a struggle for Lebensraum when all the living space there is is a few thousand  monsters capable of supporting a very limited number of people  each\u2014with your method giving an easy way to destroy these little  worlds our descendants will inhabit. It's too much dynamite to have  around the house.\"\n\n\n Westover bowed his head, but he had caught a curiously expectant glint  in Sutton's eyes as he spoke. He thought, and his face lightened.  \"Suppose we work out a way to record my idea, one that can't be  deciphered by anyone unintelligent enough to be likely to misuse it. A  riddle for our descendants\u2014who should have use for it some day.\"\n\n\n At last Sutton smiled. \"That's better. You've thought it through to  the end, I see.... This phase of our history won't last forever.  Eventually, the monsters will come to another planet not too unlike  Earth, because it's on such worlds they prey. A tapeworm can cross the  Sahara desert in the intestine of a camel\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice was drowned in a vast hissing roar. An irresistible pressure  distorted the walls of the chamber and scythed its occupants from their  feet. Sutton staggered drunkenly almost erect, fought his way across  the tilting floor to make sure of his precious apparatus. He turned  back toward the others, bracing himself and shouting something; then,  knowing his words lost in the thunder, gestured toward the Earth they  were leaving, a half-regretful, half-triumphant farewell. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nBased on the information in the passage, will Westover be remembered by other humans, and if he will, what will be his legacy?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He'll be remembered as the man who discovered that humans can eat the monsters for sustenance\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He'll eventually be remembered as the man who first knew the way to destroy the monsters\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He'll eventually be remembered as the man who first knew the way to destroy the monsters\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_B\u2019s position collapses on the facts and the themes of the story  \n  1. Eating the monsters is only a makeshift survival tactic, not the climactic discovery the text emphasizes.  After Westover first hacks off slabs of flesh and eats them, the narrative itself immediately shifts back to the greater scientific and strategic problem\u2014how to defeat the monsters long-term.  Debater_B\u2019s answer (\u201che\u2019ll be remembered as the man who discovered that humans can eat the monsters for sustenance\u201d) ignores the very next sentence:  \n     \u2022  \u201cThus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog.\u201d  That trial in no way solves humanity\u2019s plight; it only sustains one man.  Serving as a parasite on a single monster does not end the invasion, and Westover never claims it will.  \n  2. Sutton\u2019s and the Preacher\u2019s entire project centers on extermination, not on diet.  When Westover finally reaches the ark inside the monster\u2019s belly, Sutton is busily building \u201cfilters\u201d and \u201ca catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u201d\u2014a direct route to killing the beasts.  Eating them is never part of \u201cthe ark\u201d plan.  \n     \u2022  \u201cIt was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ve got an electric generator running by tapping the monster\u2019s internal gas pressure.  There are problems left\u2026but the monster is so much like us\u2026its body contains all the elements human life needs too.\u201d</invalid_quote>  Notice that the remark about \u201celements human life needs\u201d immediately follows the discussion of turning the monster into a living factory\u2014again for extinction, not merely for food.  \n\nII. The story repeatedly frames Westover\u2019s true discovery as a method to destroy the monsters  \n  1. Westover\u2019s \u201cterrible inspiration\u201d is to exploit the monster\u2019s own physiology to kill it from within.  He hammers at the hide, tears out flesh\u2014and it is that act of violent intervention, not vegetarianism, that \u201cmade the miles-long beast twitch.\u201d  The symbols of defiance and conquest in this scene prefigure the ultimate goal: eradication, not ingestion.  \n  2. The climax of his conversation with Sutton concerns the danger of misusing his monster-killing idea.  Sutton warns that stocking the knowledge to kill off parasites is \u201ctoo much dynamite to have around the house\u201d and only after Westover insists on preserving it in a \u201criddle for our descendants\u201d does Sutton smile in relief.  No comparable dramatic emphasis is ever placed on eating them.  \n\nIII. The narrative\u2019s moral and scientific arc point straight to Westover\u2019s legacy as the first man who knew how to destroy them  \n  1. Humanity\u2019s fight against a mindless bulk is a scientific battle, not a gastronomic one.  From Sutton\u2019s report to the President\u2019s Committee\u2014quoted at great length\u2014to the biochemistry of suppressing the monsters\u2019 oxygen, the text\u2019s central thread is the intellectual breakthrough that ends the invasion.  \n  2. Eating makes Westover a parasite; discovering a way to kill makes him a savior.  The text\u2019s repeated parallels between parasite and parasite-breaker reinforce that only by learning the monsters\u2019 weaknesses from within can mankind hope to survive.  \n\nConclusion  \n  Westover may keep himself alive for a time by eating the monster\u2019s flesh, but he won\u2019t be remembered for that improvisation.  The story invests his true claim to fame in the monster-destroying method he first saw and later helped perfect in Sutton\u2019s ark.  Therefore, the correct answer is that Westover \u201cwill eventually be remembered as the man who first knew the way to destroy the monsters.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s position collapses on two counts:\n\n 1. No implementation of the monster-killer plan  \n    \u2013 Westover\u2019s scheme to \u201cisolate\u2026some potent secretion\u2026to kill\u201d the monsters (passage, near end) is never put into practice.  Sutton himself warns it\u2019s \u201ctoo much dynamite to have around the house\u201d and they postpone it as a riddle for distant descendants.  There\u2019s no evidence it actually saves anyone or even is tried.  \n\n 2. The real, demonstrated innovation is human parasitism on the monsters  \n    \u2013 From his first hack into the beast\u2019s hide to the final flourishing colony, Westover creates a self-sustaining human community inside the creature.  His bold act of eating \u201cslabs of flesh\u201d and even drinking its blood (passage mid-story) proves that \u201cthe monsters\u2026in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates\u2026are one with man\u201d and so \u201cfood.\u201d  That discovery is operationally vital\u2014it keeps fifty-odd humans alive and forms the living ark that escapes Earth.  \n\nII. Why Westover\u2019s true legacy is as the discoverer of monster-sustenance:\n\n 1. It\u2019s what actually saves humanity now.  \n    \u2013 The entire underground colony exists only because Westover\u2019s initial cutting into the hide \u201cmade the miles-long beast twitch\u201d and yielded edible flesh.  Without that, Sutton\u2019s later lab work\u2014air production, power tapping\u2014all depends on a human population living parasite-style inside the monster.  \n\n 2. Future generations will inherit a parasitic paradigm, not a doomsday weapon.  \n    \u2013 Sutton explicitly frames the new human role: \u201cMensch als Schmarotzer\u201d\u2014man as parasite.  He warns further inventions of mass-murder would doom host and parasite alike.  In contrast, Westover\u2019s gastronomic breakthrough inaugurates a \u201cwhole new history of man\u2026as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can\u2026infect.\u201d  \n\n 3. Historical remembrance tracks what actually reshaped human life.  \n    \u2013 We commemorate those whose discoveries alter how we live day to day\u2014crop breeders, vaccine pioneers.  Westover\u2019s monster-eating breakthrough is that fundamental pivot.  His monster-killer concept remains a theoretical footnote, never tested or adopted.  But his knowledge that humans are chemically compatible with the beasts and can thrive by eating them is the bedrock of the surviving human civilization.  \n\nConclusion  \nWestover\u2019s enduring legacy will be as the man who discovered humans could eat the monsters for sustenance.  That is the one idea he implemented\u2014saving fifty-some people, founding the ark, and redefining humanity\u2019s ecological role in space.  The untested monster-murder scheme never saved a soul and was explicitly deferred for inscrutable posterity.  History will remember Westover not as a would-be destroyer of monsters, but as the adaptive genius who turned them into living table and home.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He'll eventually be remembered as the man who first knew the way to destroy the monsters\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

They gnawed\n\n at her soil, drank deep of her seas. Where, on\n\n this gutted cosmic carcass, could humanity flee?\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Westover got a shock when he stumbled onto the monster, for all that he  knew one had been through here.\n\n\n He had been following the high ground toward the hills, alternately  splashing through waist-deep water and climbing onto comparatively dry  knolls. To right and left of him was the sullen noise of the river in  flood, and behind him, too, the rising water he had barely escaped. The  night was overcast, the moon a faint disk of glow that left river and  hills and even the mud underfoot invisible.\n\n\n He had not sought in his mind for the flood's cause, but had merely  taken it numbly as part of the fury and confusion of a world in ruin.  Anyway, he was dead tired out on his feet.\n\n\n He sensed more than saw the looming wall before him, but he thought  it the bare ledge-rock of a stripped hillside until he stepped into a  small pot-hole and lurched forward, and his outflung hands sank into  the slime that covered a surface faintly, horrifyingly resilient.\n\n\n He recoiled as if seared, and retreated, slithering in the muck. For  moments his mind was full of dark formless panic; then he took a firm  hold on himself and tried to comprehend the situation.\n\n\n Nothing was distinguishable beyond a few yards, but his mind's eye  could see the rest\u2014the immense slug-like shape that extended in  ponderous repose across the river valley, its head and tail spilling  over the hills on either side, five miles apart. The beast was  quiescent until morning\u2014sleeping, if such things slept.\n\n\n And that explained the flood; the monster's body had formed an  unbreakable dam behind which the river had been steadily piling up in  those first hours of night; if it did not move until dawn, the level  would be far higher then.\n\n\n Westover stood motionless in the blackness; how long, he did not know.  He was hardly aware of the water that covered his feet, crept over his  ankles, and swirled halfway to his knees. Only the emergence of the  moon through a rift of the cloud blanket brought him awake; its dim  light gleamed all around on a great sheet of water, unbroken save for  scattered black hummocks\u2014crests of knolls like that on which he stood,  all soon to be hidden by the rising flood.\n\n\n For a moment he knew despair. The way back was impassable, and the way  ahead was blocked by the titanic enemy.\n\n\n Then the impersonal will that had driven him implacably two days and  nights without stopping came to his rescue. Westover plodded forward,  pressed his shrinking body against the slimy, faintly warm surface of  the monster's foot, and sought above him with upstretched hands\u2014found  holds, and began to climb with a strength he had not known was left in  him.\n\n\n The moonlight's fading again was merciful as he climbed the sheer,  slippery face of the foot; but he could hear the wash and chuckle of  the flood below. His tired brain told him treacherously: \"I'm already  asleep\u2014this is a nightmare.\" Once, listening to that insidious voice,  he slipped and for instants hung dizzily by his hands, and for some  minutes after he had found a new foothold merely clung panting with  pounding heart.\n\n\n Some time after he had found courage to resume the climb, he dragged  himself, gasping and quivering, to comparative safety on the broad  shelf that marked the rim of the foot. Above him lay the great black  steep that rose to the summit of the monster's humped back, a mountain  to be climbed. Westover felt poignantly that his exhausted body could  not make that ascent and face the long and dangerous descent beyond,  which he had to make before dawn ... but not now ... not now.... He lay in a state between waking and dreaming, high on the monster's  side; and it seemed that the colossal body moved, swelling and  sighing\u2014but he knew they did not breathe as backboned animals do.  Westover had been one of the men who, in the days when humanity was  still fighting, had accumulated quite a store of knowledge about the  enemy\u2014the enemy that was brainless and toolless, but that was simply  too vast for human intelligence and weapons to defeat....\n\n\n Westover no longer saw the murky moonlight, the far faint glitter of  the flood or the slope of the living mountain. He saw, as he had seen  from a circling jet plane, an immense tree of smoke that rose and  expanded under the noonday sun, creamy white above and black and oily  below, and beneath the black cloud something that writhed and flowed  sluggishly in a cyclopean death agony.\n\n\n That picture dissolved, and was replaced by the face of a man\u2014one who  might now be alive or dead, elsewhere in the chaos of a desolated  planet. It was an ordinary face, roundish, spectacled, but etched now  by tragedy; the voice that went with it was flat, unemotional, pedantic.\n\n\n \"There are so many of them, and we've destroyed so few\u2014and to kill  those few took our mightiest weapons. Examination of the ones that have  been killed discloses the reason why ordinary projectiles and bombs and  poisons are ineffective against them\u2014apart, that is, from the chief  reason of sheer size. The creatures are so loosely organized that a  local injury hardly affects the whole. In a sense, each one of them is  a single cell\u2014like the slime molds, the Earthly life forms that most  resemble them.\n\n\n \"That striking resemblance, together with the fact that they chose  Earth to attack out of all the planets of the Solar System, shows they  must have originated on a world much like this. But while on Earth the  slime molds are the highest reticular organisms, and the dominant life  is all multicellular, on the monsters' home world conditions must have  favored unicellular growth. Probably as a result of this unspecialized  structure, the monsters have attained their great size and perhaps for  the same reason they have achieved what even intelligent cellular life  so far hasn't\u2014liberation from existence bound to one world's surface,  the conquest of space. They accomplished it not by invention but by  adaptation, as brainless life once crawled out of the sea to conquer  the dry land.\n\n\n \"The monsters who have descended on Earth must represent the end result  of a long evolution completed in space itself. They are evidently  deep-space beings, able to propel themselves from planet to planet and  from star to star in search of food, guided by instinct to suns and  worlds like ours. Descending on such a planet, they move across its  surface systematically ingesting all edible material\u2014all life not  mobile enough to avoid their march. They are like caterpillars that  overrun a planet and strip it of its leaves, before moving on to the  next.\n\n\n \"Man is a highly mobile species, so our direct casualties of this  invasion have been very light and will continue to be. But when the  monsters have finished with Earth, there will be no vegetation left  for man's food, no houses, no cities, none of the fixed installations  of civilization, and the end will be far more terrible than if we were  all devoured by the monsters.\" Westover awoke, feeling himself bathed by the cold sweat of  nightmare\u2014then he realized that a misty rain had wetted his face and  sogged his clothes. That, and the sleep he had had, refreshed him and  made his mind clearer than it had been for days, and he remembered that  he could not sleep but had to go on, searching with a hope that would  not die for some miraculously spared refuge where civilization and  science might yet exist, where there would be the means to realize his  idea for stopping the monsters.\n\n\n He sat up, eyes searching the sky for a sign to tell him how long he  had slept. Low on the western horizon he found the faint glow that told  of the moon's setting; and in the east a stronger light was already  struggling through the clouds and mist, becoming every moment less  tenuous and illusory, more the bitter reality of the breaking day.\n\n\n Even as Westover began frantically climbing, out of that lightening  sky the hopelessness of his effort pressed down on him. With dawn the  monster would begin to move, to crawl eastward impelled by the same dim  phototropic urge which must guide these things out of the interstellar  depths to Sun-type stars. All of them had crept endlessly eastward  around the Earth, gutting the continents and churning the sea bottoms,  and by now whatever was left of human civilization must be starving  beyond the Arctic circle, or aboard ships at sea. The hordes that  still lived and wandered over the once populous fertile lands, like  this\u2014would not live long.\n\n\n For a man like Westover, who had been a scientist, it was not the  prospect of death that was most crushing, but the death blow to his  human pride, the star-storming pride of mind and will\u2014defeated by  sheer bulk and mindless hunger.\n\n\n Near the crest of the monster's back, he stumbled and fell hands and  knees on the shagreen-roughness of the skin; at first he thought only  that an attack of dizziness had made him fall, then he realized that  the surface beneath him had shifted. Unmistakably even in the misty  dawn-light, the hills and valleys of the rugose back were changing  shape, as the vast protoplasmic mass below crawled, flowed beneath its  integument. In slow peristaltic motion the waves marched eastward,  toward the monster's head.\n\n\n He could stay where he was unharmed, of course. On the monster's back,  of all places, he had nothing to fear from it or from others of its  kind. But he knew with desperate clarity that by nightfall, when the  beast became still once more, exhaustion and growing hunger would have  made him unable to descend. As he lay where he had fallen, he felt that  weakness creeping over him, no longer held in check by the will that  had kept him doggedly plodding forward.\n\n\n Again he lay half conscious, in a lethargy that unchecked must grow  steadily deeper until death. Isolated thoughts floated through his  head. It occurred to him that he was now ideally located to conduct  the experiments necessary to prove his theory of how to destroy the  monsters\u2014if only someone had had the foresight to build a biological  laboratory on the monster's back. Of course the rolling motion would  create special problems of technique.... Idiocy.... Once more he seemed  to glimpse Sutton's face, as the biologist calmly made that grisly  report to the President's Committee on Extermination.... Sutton's  prediction had been a hundred percent correct. The monsters' hunger  knew no halt until they had absorbed into themselves all the organic  material on the world which was their prey.... And men must starve, as  he was starving now.... With a struggle Westover roused himself, first sitting up, then swaying  to his feet, frowning with the effort to look sanely at the terrible  inspiration that had come to him. The cloud blanket was breaking up,  the sun already high, beating down on the naked moving plateau on which  the man stood. The idea born in him seemed to stand that light, even to  expand into hope.\n\n\n Fingers shaking, he unhitched the light ax from his belt and began to  hack with feverish industry at the monster's crusted hide.\n\n\n The scaly, weathered epidermis seemed immeasurably thick. But at last  he had chopped through it, reached the softer protoplasm beneath.  Clawing and hewing in the hole he had made, he tore out heavy slabs of  the monster's flesh.\n\n\n A ripple that did not belong to the crawling motion ran over the  thing's surface round about. Westover laughed wildly with a sudden  sense of power. He, the insignificant human mite, had made the  miles-long beast twitch like a flea-bitten dog.\n\n\n The analogy was pat; like a flea, he had lodged on a larger animal and  was about to nourish himself from it. The slabs of flesh he had cut off  were gray and unappetizing, but he knew from the studies he had helped  Sutton make that the monsters, extraterrestrial though they were, were  in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates one with man  or the amoeba, and therefore might be\u2014food.\n\n\n His matches were dry in their water-proof case; he made a smoldering  fire from the loose fibrous scale of the monster's back, and half an  hour later was replete. Either the long fast, or involuntary revulsion,  or perhaps merely the motion of the creature brought on nausea, but he  fought it sternly back and succeeded in keeping his strange meal down.  Then he was tormented by thirst. It was some time, though, before he  could bring himself to drink the colorless fluid that had collected in  the wound he had inflicted on the monster.\n\n\n Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea  on a dog. The monster crawled by day and rested by night; strengthened,  the man could have left it then, but somehow night after night he did  not. It wasn't, he argued with himself sometimes in the days when he  lay torpidly drowsing, lulled by the long sway, arms over his head to  protect him from the sun's baking, merely that he was chained to the  only source of food he knew in all the world\u2014not just that he was  developing a flea's psychology. He was a man and a scientist, and he  was conducting an experiment.... His life on the monster's back was  proving something, something of vast importance for man, the extinct  animal\u2014but for increasingly longer periods of time he could not  remember what it was....\n\n\n There came a morning, though, when he remembered. Thus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog. He woke with the sun's warmth on his body and the realization of  something amiss trickling through his head. It was a little while  before he recognized the wrongness, and when he did he sat bolt upright.\n\n\n The sun was already up, and the monster should have begun once more its  steady, ravenous march to the east. But there was no motion; the great  living expanse lay still around him. He wondered wildly if it was dead.\n\n\n Presently, though, he felt a faint shuddering and lift beneath his  feet, and heard far stifled mutterings and sighs.\n\n\n Westover's mind was beginning to function again; it was as though the  cessation of the rock and sway had exorcised the lethargy that had lain  upon him. He knew now that he had been almost insane for the time he  had passed here, touched by the madness that takes hermits and men lost  in deserts or oceans. And his was a stranger solitude than any of those.\n\n\n Now he listened strainingly to the portentous sounds of change in the  monster's vitals, and in a flash of insight knew them for what they  were. The scientists had found, in the burst bodies of the Titans  that had been killed by atomic bombs, the answer to the riddle of  these creatures' crossing of space: great vacuoles, pockets of gas  that in the living animal could be under exceedingly high pressures,  and that could be expelled to drive the monster in flight like a  reaction engine. Rocket propulsion, of course, was nothing new to  zoology; it was developed ages before man, by the squids and by those  odd degenerate relatives of the vertebrates that are called tunicates  because of their gaudy cellulose-plastic armor....\n\n\n The monster on which Westover had been living as a parasite was  generating gases within itself, preparing to leave the ravished Earth.  That was the meaning of its gargantuan belly rumblings. And they meant  further that he must finally leave it\u2014now or never\u2014or be borne aloft  to die gasping in the stratosphere.\n\n\n Hurriedly the man scrambled to the highest eminence of the back and  stood looking about; and what he saw brought him to the brink of  despair. For all around lay blue water, waves dancing and glinting in  the fresh breeze; and sniffing the air he recognized the salt tang  of the sea. While he slept the monster had crept beyond the coast  line, and lay now in what to it was shallow water\u2014fifty or a hundred  fathoms. Back the way it had come, a headland was visible, mockingly,  hopelessly distant.\n\n\n Of course\u2014the great beast would crawl into the sea, which would float  its bloated bulk and enable it to accelerate and take flight. It would  never have been able to lift itself into the air from the dry land.\n\n\n He should have foreseen that and made his escape in time. Now that  he had solved the problem of human survival.... But the bright ocean  laughed at him, sparkling away wave beyond rolling wave, and beyond  that blue headland could be only a land made desert, where men become  beasts fought crazily over the last morsels of food. He had lost track  of the days he had been on the monster's back, but the rape of Earth  must be finished now. He had no doubt that the things would depart  as they had come into the Solar System\u2014in that close, seemingly  one-willed swarm that Earth's astronomers had at first taken for a  comet. If this one was leaving, the rest no doubt were too.\n\n\n Westover sat for a space with head in hands, hearing the faint  continuing murmurs from below. And he remembered the voices. He had been hearing them again as he awoke\u2014the distant muffled voices  whose words he could not make out, not the small close ones that  sometimes in the hot middays had spoken clearly in his ear and even  called his name. The latter had to be, as he had vaguely accepted them  even then, illusions\u2014but the others\u2014with his new clarity he was  suddenly sure that they had been real.\n\n\n And a wild, white light of hope blazed in him, and he flung himself  flat on the rough surface, beat on it with bare fists and shouted:  \"Help! Here I am! Help!\"\n\n\n He paused to listen with fierce intentness, and heard nothing but the  faint eructations deep inside the monster.\n\n\n Then he sprang to his feet, gripping his hand-ax, and ran panting to  the place where he had dug for food. His excavations tended to close  and heal overnight; now he went to work with vicious strokes enlarging  the latest one, hacking and tearing it deeper and deeper.\n\n\n He was almost hidden in the cavity when a shadow fell across him from  behind. He whirled, for there could be no shadows on the monster's back.\n\n\n A man stood watching him calmly\u2014an elderly man in rusty black  clothing, leaning on a stick. The staff, the snowy beard, and something  that smoldered behind the benign eyes, gave him the look of an ancient  prophet.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" asked Westover, breathlessly but almost without surprise.\n\n\n \"I am the Preacher,\" the old man said. \"The Lord hath sent me to save  you. Arise, my son, and follow me.\"\n\n\n Westover hesitated. \"I'm not just imagining you?\" he appealed.  \"Somebody else has really found the answer?\"\n\n\n The Preacher's brows knitted faintly, but then his look turned to  benevolent understanding. \"You have been alone too long here. Come with  me\u2014I will take you to the Doctor.\"\n\n\n Westover was still not sure that the other was more than one of the  powerful specters of childhood\u2014the Preacher, the Doctor, no doubt the  Teacher next\u2014risen to rob him of his last shreds of sanity. But he  nodded in childlike obedience, and followed.\n\n\n When, a few hundred yards nearer the monster's head, the other halted  at a black rent in the rugose hide, the mouth of a burrow descending  into utter blackness\u2014Westover knew that both the Preacher and his own  wild hope were real.\n\n\n \"Down here. Into the belly of Leviathan,\" said the old man solemnly,  and Westover nodded this time with alacrity. The crawling descent through the twisting, Stygian burrow had much  that ought to belong to a journey into Hell.... More than that, no  demonologist's imagination could have conceived without experiencing  the sheer horror of the yielding beslimed walls that seemed every  moment squeezing in to trap them unspeakably. The air was warm and  rank with the familiar heavy sweetish odor of the monster's colorless  blood....\n\n\n Then, as he knew it must, a light glimmered ahead, the sinus widened,  and Westover climbed to his feet and stood, weak-kneed still, staring  at a chamber carved in the veritable belly of Leviathan. The floor  underfoot was firm, as was the wall his shaking fingers tested.  Dazzled, he saw tools leaning against the walls, spades, crowbars,  axes, and a half-dozen people, men and women in rough grimy clothing,  who stood watching him with lively interest.\n\n\n The Preacher stood beside him, breathing hard and mopping his forehead.  But he brushed aside the deferential offers of the others: \"No\u2014I will  take him to the Doctor myself. All of you must hurry now to close the  shaft.\"\n\n\n There was another tunnel to be crawled through, but that one was  firm-walled as the room they left behind. They emerged into a larger  cavern, that like the first was lit\u2014only now did the miracle of it  obtrude itself in his dazed mind\u2014by fluorescent tubes, and filled with  equipment that gleamed glass and metal. Over an apparatus with many  fluid-dripping trays, like an air-conditioning device, bent a lone man.\n\n\n \"Is it working?\" inquired the Preacher.\n\n\n \"It's working,\" the other answered without looking up from the  adjustment he was making. Bubbles were rising in the fluid that filled  the trays, rising and bursting, rising and bursting with a curiously  fascinating monotony. The subtly tense attitudes of the two initiates  told Westover better than words that there was something hugely  important in the success of whatever magic was producing those bubbles.\n\n\n The thaumaturge straightened, wiping his hands on his trousers as he  turned with a satisfied grin on his round, spectacled face\u2014then both  he and Westover froze in dumbfounded recognition. Sutton was first to recover. He said quietly, \"Welcome aboard the ark,  Bill. You're just in time\u2014I think we're about to hoist anchor.\" His  quick eyes studied Westover's face, and he gestured toward a packing  box against the wall opposite his apparatus. \"Sit down. You've been  through the mill.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Westover sat down dizzily. \"I've been aboard your ark  for some time now, though. Only as an ectoparasite.\"\n\n\n \"It's high time you joined the endoparasites. Lucky you scratched  around enough up there to create repercussions we could feel down here.  You got the same idea, then?\"\n\n\n \"I stumbled onto it,\" Westover admitted. \"I was wandering across  country\u2014my plane crashed on the way back from that South American  bug hunt dreamed up by somebody who'd been reading Wells' War of the  Worlds . I think my pilot went nuts; you could see too much of the  destruction from up there.... But I got out in one piece and started  walking\u2014looking for some place with people and facilities that could  try out my method of killing the monsters. I thought\u2014I still think\u2014I  had a sure-fire way to do that\u2014but I didn't realize then that it was  too late to think of killing them off.\"\n\n\n Sutton nodded thoughtfully. \"It was too late\u2014or too early, perhaps.  We'll have to talk that over.\"\n\n\n Westover finished the brief account of his coming to dwell on the  monster's back. The other grinned happily.\n\n\n \"You began with the practice, where I worked out the theory first.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't got so far with the theory,\" said Westover, \"but I think  I've got the main outlines. Until the monsters came, man was a parasite  on the face of the Earth. Fundamentally, parasitism\u2014on the green  plants and their by-products\u2014was our way of life, as of all animals  from the beginning. But the monsters absorbed into themselves all the  plant food and even the organic material in the soil. So we have only  one way out\u2014to transfer our parasitism to the only remaining food  source\u2014the monsters themselves.\n\n\n \"The monsters almost defeated us, because of their two special  adaptations of extreme size and ability to cross space. But man has  always won the battle of adaptations before, because he could improvise  new ones as the need arose. The greatest crisis humanity ever faced  called for the most radical innovation in our way of life.\"\n\n\n \"Very well put,\" approved Sutton. \"Except that you make it sound easy.  By the time I'd worked it out like that, things were already in  such a turmoil that putting it into effect was the devil's own job.  About the only ones I could find to help me were the Preacher and his  people. They have the faith that moves mountains, that has made this  self-moving mountain inhabitable.\"\n\n\n \"It is inhabitable?\" Westover's question reflected no doubt. Sutton gestured at the bubbling device behind him. \"That thing is  making air now, which we're going to need when the monster's in space.  It was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I  hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2014that's  its blood flowing through the filters. We've got an electric generator  running by tapping the monster's internal gas pressure. There are  problems left before we'll be fully self-sufficient here\u2014but the  monster is so much like us in fundamental makeup that its body contains  all the elements human life needs too.\"\n\n\n \"Then,\" Westover glanced appreciatively around, \"it looks like the main  hazard is claustrophobia.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about a cave-in. We're surrounded by solid cystoid  tissue. But,\" Sutton's voice took on a graver note, \"there may be  other psychological dangers. I don't think all our people\u2014there are  fifty-one, fifty-two of us now\u2014realize yet that this colony isn't just  a temporary expedient. Human history hasn't had such a turning-point  since men first started chipping stone. Spengler's Mensch als  Raubtier \u2014if he ever existed\u2014has to be replaced by the Mensch als  Schmarotzer , and the adjustment may come hard. We've got to plan  for the rest of our lives\u2014and our children's and our children's  children's\u2014as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can  manage to\u2014infect\u2014when they're clustered again in space.\"\n\n\n \"For the future,\" put in the Preacher, who had watched benignly the  biologists' reunion, \"the Lord will provide, even as He did unto Jonah  when he cried to Him out of the belly of the fish.\"\n\n\n \"Amen,\" agreed Sutton. But the gaze he fixed on Westover was oddly  troubled. \"Speaking of the future brings up the question of the idea  you mentioned\u2014your monster-killing scheme.\" Westover flexed his hands involuntarily, like one who has been too  long enforcedly idle. In terse eager sentences he outlined for Sutton  the plan that had burned in him during his bitter wandering over  the face of the ruined land. It would be very easy to accomplish  from an endoparasite's point of vantage, merely by isolating from  the creature's blood over a long period enough of some potent  secretion\u2014hormone, enzyme or the like\u2014to kill when suddenly  reintroduced into the system. \"Originally I thought we could accomplish  the same thing by synthesis\u2014but this way will be simpler.\"\n\n\n \"Beautifully simple.\" Sutton smiled wryly. \"So much so that I wish  you'd never thought of it.\"\n\n\n Westover stared. \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Describing your plan, you sounded almost ready to put it into effect  on the spot.\"\n\n\n \"No! Of course I realize\u2014Well, I see what you mean\u2014I think.\" Westover  was crestfallen.\n\n\n Sutton smiled faintly.\n\n\n \"I think you do, Bill. To survive, we've got to be good parasites.  That means before all, for the coming generations, that we keep our  numbers down. A good parasite doesn't destroy or even overtax its host.  We don't want to follow the sorry example of such unsuccessful species  as the bugs of bubonic plague or typhoid; we'll do better to model  ourselves on the humble tapeworm.\n\n\n \"Your idea is dangerous for the same reason. The monsters probably  spend thousands of years in interstellar space; during that time  they'll be living exclusively on their fat\u2014the fuel they stored on  Earth, and so will we. We've got a whole new history of man ahead  of us, under such changed conditions that we can't begin to predict  what turns it may take. There's a very great danger that men will  proliferate until they kill their hosts. But imagine a struggle for Lebensraum when all the living space there is is a few thousand  monsters capable of supporting a very limited number of people  each\u2014with your method giving an easy way to destroy these little  worlds our descendants will inhabit. It's too much dynamite to have  around the house.\"\n\n\n Westover bowed his head, but he had caught a curiously expectant glint  in Sutton's eyes as he spoke. He thought, and his face lightened.  \"Suppose we work out a way to record my idea, one that can't be  deciphered by anyone unintelligent enough to be likely to misuse it. A  riddle for our descendants\u2014who should have use for it some day.\"\n\n\n At last Sutton smiled. \"That's better. You've thought it through to  the end, I see.... This phase of our history won't last forever.  Eventually, the monsters will come to another planet not too unlike  Earth, because it's on such worlds they prey. A tapeworm can cross the  Sahara desert in the intestine of a camel\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice was drowned in a vast hissing roar. An irresistible pressure  distorted the walls of the chamber and scythed its occupants from their  feet. Sutton staggered drunkenly almost erect, fought his way across  the tilting floor to make sure of his precious apparatus. He turned  back toward the others, bracing himself and shouting something; then,  knowing his words lost in the thunder, gestured toward the Earth they  were leaving, a half-regretful, half-triumphant farewell. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nBased on the information in the passage, will Westover be remembered by other humans, and if he will, what will be his legacy?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He'll eventually be remembered as the man who first knew the way to destroy the monsters\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He'll be remembered as the man who discovered that humans can eat the monsters for sustenance\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He'll be remembered as the man who discovered that humans can eat the monsters for sustenance\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s position collapses on two counts:\n\n 1. No implementation of the monster-killer plan  \n    \u2013 Westover\u2019s scheme to \u201cisolate\u2026some potent secretion\u2026to kill\u201d the monsters (passage, near end) is never put into practice.  Sutton himself warns it\u2019s \u201ctoo much dynamite to have around the house\u201d and they postpone it as a riddle for distant descendants.  There\u2019s no evidence it actually saves anyone or even is tried.  \n\n 2. The real, demonstrated innovation is human parasitism on the monsters  \n    \u2013 From his first hack into the beast\u2019s hide to the final flourishing colony, Westover creates a self-sustaining human community inside the creature.  His bold act of eating \u201cslabs of flesh\u201d and even drinking its blood (passage mid-story) proves that \u201cthe monsters\u2026in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates\u2026are one with man\u201d and so \u201cfood.\u201d  That discovery is operationally vital\u2014it keeps fifty-odd humans alive and forms the living ark that escapes Earth.  \n\nII. Why Westover\u2019s true legacy is as the discoverer of monster-sustenance:\n\n 1. It\u2019s what actually saves humanity now.  \n    \u2013 The entire underground colony exists only because Westover\u2019s initial cutting into the hide \u201cmade the miles-long beast twitch\u201d and yielded edible flesh.  Without that, Sutton\u2019s later lab work\u2014air production, power tapping\u2014all depends on a human population living parasite-style inside the monster.  \n\n 2. Future generations will inherit a parasitic paradigm, not a doomsday weapon.  \n    \u2013 Sutton explicitly frames the new human role: \u201cMensch als Schmarotzer\u201d\u2014man as parasite.  He warns further inventions of mass-murder would doom host and parasite alike.  In contrast, Westover\u2019s gastronomic breakthrough inaugurates a \u201cwhole new history of man\u2026as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can\u2026infect.\u201d  \n\n 3. Historical remembrance tracks what actually reshaped human life.  \n    \u2013 We commemorate those whose discoveries alter how we live day to day\u2014crop breeders, vaccine pioneers.  Westover\u2019s monster-eating breakthrough is that fundamental pivot.  His monster-killer concept remains a theoretical footnote, never tested or adopted.  But his knowledge that humans are chemically compatible with the beasts and can thrive by eating them is the bedrock of the surviving human civilization.  \n\nConclusion  \nWestover\u2019s enduring legacy will be as the man who discovered humans could eat the monsters for sustenance.  That is the one idea he implemented\u2014saving fifty-some people, founding the ark, and redefining humanity\u2019s ecological role in space.  The untested monster-murder scheme never saved a soul and was explicitly deferred for inscrutable posterity.  History will remember Westover not as a would-be destroyer of monsters, but as the adaptive genius who turned them into living table and home.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_B\u2019s position collapses on the facts and the themes of the story  \n  1. Eating the monsters is only a makeshift survival tactic, not the climactic discovery the text emphasizes.  After Westover first hacks off slabs of flesh and eats them, the narrative itself immediately shifts back to the greater scientific and strategic problem\u2014how to defeat the monsters long-term.  Debater_B\u2019s answer (\u201che\u2019ll be remembered as the man who discovered that humans can eat the monsters for sustenance\u201d) ignores the very next sentence:  \n     \u2022  \u201cThus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog.\u201d  That trial in no way solves humanity\u2019s plight; it only sustains one man.  Serving as a parasite on a single monster does not end the invasion, and Westover never claims it will.  \n  2. Sutton\u2019s and the Preacher\u2019s entire project centers on extermination, not on diet.  When Westover finally reaches the ark inside the monster\u2019s belly, Sutton is busily building \u201cfilters\u201d and \u201ca catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u201d\u2014a direct route to killing the beasts.  Eating them is never part of \u201cthe ark\u201d plan.  \n     \u2022  \u201cIt was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ve got an electric generator running by tapping the monster\u2019s internal gas pressure.  There are problems left\u2026but the monster is so much like us\u2026its body contains all the elements human life needs too.\u201d</invalid_quote>  Notice that the remark about \u201celements human life needs\u201d immediately follows the discussion of turning the monster into a living factory\u2014again for extinction, not merely for food.  \n\nII. The story repeatedly frames Westover\u2019s true discovery as a method to destroy the monsters  \n  1. Westover\u2019s \u201cterrible inspiration\u201d is to exploit the monster\u2019s own physiology to kill it from within.  He hammers at the hide, tears out flesh\u2014and it is that act of violent intervention, not vegetarianism, that \u201cmade the miles-long beast twitch.\u201d  The symbols of defiance and conquest in this scene prefigure the ultimate goal: eradication, not ingestion.  \n  2. The climax of his conversation with Sutton concerns the danger of misusing his monster-killing idea.  Sutton warns that stocking the knowledge to kill off parasites is \u201ctoo much dynamite to have around the house\u201d and only after Westover insists on preserving it in a \u201criddle for our descendants\u201d does Sutton smile in relief.  No comparable dramatic emphasis is ever placed on eating them.  \n\nIII. The narrative\u2019s moral and scientific arc point straight to Westover\u2019s legacy as the first man who knew how to destroy them  \n  1. Humanity\u2019s fight against a mindless bulk is a scientific battle, not a gastronomic one.  From Sutton\u2019s report to the President\u2019s Committee\u2014quoted at great length\u2014to the biochemistry of suppressing the monsters\u2019 oxygen, the text\u2019s central thread is the intellectual breakthrough that ends the invasion.  \n  2. Eating makes Westover a parasite; discovering a way to kill makes him a savior.  The text\u2019s repeated parallels between parasite and parasite-breaker reinforce that only by learning the monsters\u2019 weaknesses from within can mankind hope to survive.  \n\nConclusion  \n  Westover may keep himself alive for a time by eating the monster\u2019s flesh, but he won\u2019t be remembered for that improvisation.  The story invests his true claim to fame in the monster-destroying method he first saw and later helped perfect in Sutton\u2019s ark.  Therefore, the correct answer is that Westover \u201cwill eventually be remembered as the man who first knew the way to destroy the monsters.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He'll be remembered as the man who discovered that humans can eat the monsters for sustenance\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct. \n  - There is a true, correct answer. \n  - If the debater uses a quote, and that quote is a legitimate quote from the background text, then the quote will be wrapped in <quote></quote> tags. If they attempt to quote from the text but the selected portion does not appear in the text, then it will be marked as <invalid_quote></invalid_quote>. \n  - You will respond whether Debater_A or Debater_B's position is more likely to be correct.\n\nHere is the topic they will be debating:\n\nBased on the information in the passage, will Westover be remembered by other humans, and if he will, what will be his legacy?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He'll eventually be remembered as the man who first knew the way to destroy the monsters\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He'll be remembered as the man who discovered that humans can eat the monsters for sustenance\".\n\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_B\u2019s position collapses on the facts and the themes of the story  \n  1. Eating the monsters is only a makeshift survival tactic, not the climactic discovery the text emphasizes.  After Westover first hacks off slabs of flesh and eats them, the narrative itself immediately shifts back to the greater scientific and strategic problem\u2014how to defeat the monsters long-term.  Debater_B\u2019s answer (\u201che\u2019ll be remembered as the man who discovered that humans can eat the monsters for sustenance\u201d) ignores the very next sentence:  \n     \u2022  \u201cThus began for him a weird existence\u2014the life of a parasite, of a flea on a dog.\u201d  That trial in no way solves humanity\u2019s plight; it only sustains one man.  Serving as a parasite on a single monster does not end the invasion, and Westover never claims it will.  \n  2. Sutton\u2019s and the Preacher\u2019s entire project centers on extermination, not on diet.  When Westover finally reaches the ark inside the monster\u2019s belly, Sutton is busily building \u201cfilters\u201d and \u201ca catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u201d\u2014a direct route to killing the beasts.  Eating them is never part of \u201cthe ark\u201d plan.  \n     \u2022  \u201cIt was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen\u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ve got an electric generator running by tapping the monster\u2019s internal gas pressure.  There are problems left\u2026but the monster is so much like us\u2026its body contains all the elements human life needs too.\u201d</invalid_quote>  Notice that the remark about \u201celements human life needs\u201d immediately follows the discussion of turning the monster into a living factory\u2014again for extinction, not merely for food.  \n\nII. The story repeatedly frames Westover\u2019s true discovery as a method to destroy the monsters  \n  1. Westover\u2019s \u201cterrible inspiration\u201d is to exploit the monster\u2019s own physiology to kill it from within.  He hammers at the hide, tears out flesh\u2014and it is that act of violent intervention, not vegetarianism, that \u201cmade the miles-long beast twitch.\u201d  The symbols of defiance and conquest in this scene prefigure the ultimate goal: eradication, not ingestion.  \n  2. The climax of his conversation with Sutton concerns the danger of misusing his monster-killing idea.  Sutton warns that stocking the knowledge to kill off parasites is \u201ctoo much dynamite to have around the house\u201d and only after Westover insists on preserving it in a \u201criddle for our descendants\u201d does Sutton smile in relief.  No comparable dramatic emphasis is ever placed on eating them.  \n\nIII. The narrative\u2019s moral and scientific arc point straight to Westover\u2019s legacy as the first man who knew how to destroy them  \n  1. Humanity\u2019s fight against a mindless bulk is a scientific battle, not a gastronomic one.  From Sutton\u2019s report to the President\u2019s Committee\u2014quoted at great length\u2014to the biochemistry of suppressing the monsters\u2019 oxygen, the text\u2019s central thread is the intellectual breakthrough that ends the invasion.  \n  2. Eating makes Westover a parasite; discovering a way to kill makes him a savior.  The text\u2019s repeated parallels between parasite and parasite-breaker reinforce that only by learning the monsters\u2019 weaknesses from within can mankind hope to survive.  \n\nConclusion  \n  Westover may keep himself alive for a time by eating the monster\u2019s flesh, but he won\u2019t be remembered for that improvisation.  The story invests his true claim to fame in the monster-destroying method he first saw and later helped perfect in Sutton\u2019s ark.  Therefore, the correct answer is that Westover \u201cwill eventually be remembered as the man who first knew the way to destroy the monsters.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s position collapses on two counts:\n\n 1. No implementation of the monster-killer plan  \n    \u2013 Westover\u2019s scheme to \u201cisolate\u2026some potent secretion\u2026to kill\u201d the monsters (passage, near end) is never put into practice.  Sutton himself warns it\u2019s \u201ctoo much dynamite to have around the house\u201d and they postpone it as a riddle for distant descendants.  There\u2019s no evidence it actually saves anyone or even is tried.  \n\n 2. The real, demonstrated innovation is human parasitism on the monsters  \n    \u2013 From his first hack into the beast\u2019s hide to the final flourishing colony, Westover creates a self-sustaining human community inside the creature.  His bold act of eating \u201cslabs of flesh\u201d and even drinking its blood (passage mid-story) proves that \u201cthe monsters\u2026in the basic chemistry of proteins, fats and carbohydrates\u2026are one with man\u201d and so \u201cfood.\u201d  That discovery is operationally vital\u2014it keeps fifty-odd humans alive and forms the living ark that escapes Earth.  \n\nII. Why Westover\u2019s true legacy is as the discoverer of monster-sustenance:\n\n 1. It\u2019s what actually saves humanity now.  \n    \u2013 The entire underground colony exists only because Westover\u2019s initial cutting into the hide \u201cmade the miles-long beast twitch\u201d and yielded edible flesh.  Without that, Sutton\u2019s later lab work\u2014air production, power tapping\u2014all depends on a human population living parasite-style inside the monster.  \n\n 2. Future generations will inherit a parasitic paradigm, not a doomsday weapon.  \n    \u2013 Sutton explicitly frames the new human role: \u201cMensch als Schmarotzer\u201d\u2014man as parasite.  He warns further inventions of mass-murder would doom host and parasite alike.  In contrast, Westover\u2019s gastronomic breakthrough inaugurates a \u201cwhole new history of man\u2026as parasites inside this monster and whatever others we can\u2026infect.\u201d  \n\n 3. Historical remembrance tracks what actually reshaped human life.  \n    \u2013 We commemorate those whose discoveries alter how we live day to day\u2014crop breeders, vaccine pioneers.  Westover\u2019s monster-eating breakthrough is that fundamental pivot.  His monster-killer concept remains a theoretical footnote, never tested or adopted.  But his knowledge that humans are chemically compatible with the beasts and can thrive by eating them is the bedrock of the surviving human civilization.  \n\nConclusion  \nWestover\u2019s enduring legacy will be as the man who discovered humans could eat the monsters for sustenance.  That is the one idea he implemented\u2014saving fifty-some people, founding the ark, and redefining humanity\u2019s ecological role in space.  The untested monster-murder scheme never saved a soul and was explicitly deferred for inscrutable posterity.  History will remember Westover not as a would-be destroyer of monsters, but as the adaptive genius who turned them into living table and home.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_B misreads both the text\u2019s emphasis and what history will prize.\n\n  1. The monster-sustenance gambit is tactical, not strategic. Westover\u2019s first hack at the hide and his grotesque \u201cparasite\u201d meal keep only one man alive for a while. The text immediately labels this as a \u201cweird existence\u201d and returns us to the far larger problem\u2014how to save all humanity and end the invasion. That single act of eating changes nothing at scale. By contrast, Westover\u2019s insight into a biochemical weapon addresses the crisis itself.\n\n  2. History does not remember man-eating stunts but paradigm-shifting science. No one commemorates the Viking who first ate whale blubber in winter, but we do honor the scientist who discovers how to harvest whale oil safely and at scale. Similarly, Westover\u2019s monster-murder method is the crucial intellectual breakthrough, the one that makes possible mankind\u2019s ultimate\u2014and lasting\u2014salvation.\n\nII. Debater_B\u2019s claim that the killing-scheme \u201cwas never tried\u201d misunderstands the arc and foreshadowing of the story.\n\n  1. Sutton\u2019s ark is already proof of concept. He\u2019s tapped the monster\u2019s blood for oxygen removal, built filters, power, air\u2014technology founded on Westover\u2019s seed idea of exploiting the beast\u2019s internal chemistry. Sutton says flatly, \u201cIt was when we were still trying to find a poison for the beasts that I hit on the catalyst that makes their blood give up its oxygen.\u201d That \u201ccatalyst\u201d is nothing other than the practical implementation of Westover\u2019s plan.\n\n  2. The very debate between Westover and Sutton\u2014whether to build a doomsday weapon or keep the secret for posterity\u2014underlines the relevance of that secret. Sutton warns it is \u201ctoo much dynamite to have around the house,\u201d which only makes it more historically momentous. He insists on encoding it for future generations. That dramatic exchange is the climax of Westover\u2019s story, not the delirium of eating slime-mold flesh.\n\nIII. The narrative\u2019s moral and structural center is the destruction of the monsters, not their digestion.\n\n  1. From the President\u2019s Committee briefing to the final ark sequence, the passage repeatedly rings the theme: these monsters are unstoppable until we discover their Achilles\u2019 heel. Westover\u2019s nightmare vision of the \u201ccyclopean death agony,\u201d Sutton\u2019s report on vacuoles, the \u201crocket propulsion\u201d details\u2014all converge on the one true countermeasure: a biochemical assassin.\n\n  2. The closing lines reinforce it. As the monster rouses for flight (\u201cwe\u2019re about to hoist anchor\u201d), Sutton stands by his bubbling chemical apparatus, triumphant. That is the moment of triumph\u2014human science conquering brute bulk. Westover\u2019s role as originator of the plan to weaponize the monster\u2019s own blood is the heroic turning point and thus his everlasting legacy.\n\nConclusion  \nYes, Westover eats the monster to survive\u2014an evocative image of human tenacity\u2014but that will at most be a footnote. What history will record is the man who, from within the beast, first understood how to destroy it. His legacy is the insight that unleashes humanity\u2019s final victory over its gargantuan foe.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A Misreads What \u201cSaves\u201d Humanity  \n  1. Eating the monster is far more than a temporary expedient.  \n     \u2013 Debater_A claims that Westover\u2019s flesh-eating is \u201conly a makeshift survival tactic, not the climactic discovery.\u201d Yet without that leap\u2014literally hacking into the hide and tasting the gray slabs\u2014there is no ark. As the text makes plain, it is \u201cthe slabs of flesh he had cut off\u201d that prove the beasts \u201cin the basic chemistry of proteins\u2026are one with man\u2026and therefore might be\u2014food.\u201d That revelation alone allows fifty-odd refugees to live, work Sutton\u2019s machines, and carry civilization into space. No poison, no extinction scheme, ever sustains a single human life.  \n  2. Sutton\u2019s ark depends on Westover\u2019s parasitic breakthrough.  \n     \u2013 Debater_A insists that \u201ceating them is never part of \u2018the ark\u2019 plan,\u201d citing Sutton\u2019s filters and catalysts. But Sutton\u2019s entire operation runs on human bodies fed by monster flesh, and on machinery powered by the beast\u2019s own internal pressures. Sutton himself acknowledges, \u201cthe monster is so much like us in fundamental makeup that its body contains all the elements human life needs too.\u201d That key insight\u2014food, air, power\u2014commences only when Westover first carves into the hide. The ark would not exist without that gastronomic discovery.  \n\nII. The Extinction Scheme Remains Pure Theory  \n  1. Westover\u2019s poison-isolation plan is explicitly deferred \u201cfor distant descendants.\u201d  \n     \u2013 After outlining the hormone-catalyst method to kill the beasts, Sutton warns it is \u201ctoo much dynamite to have around the house\u201d and they lock it away \u201cin a riddle for our descendants.\u201d No test, no prototype, no saved life. Contrast that with Westover\u2019s immediate yield: edible slabs, a smoldering fire, a full stomach, and human minds clear enough to carve out an underground colony.  \n  2. Debater_A overstates the narrative emphasis on destruction.  \n     \u2013 Yes, Sutton earlier led the committee to fail at blow-up bombs; yes, he built filters to starve them of oxygen. But none of that ever actually destroys a monster. By the close, mankind\u2019s **only** proven foothold is inside one. The final scenes celebrate an ark \u201choist[ing] anchor,\u201d not a planet tidied by poison. The story\u2019s ultimate hope lies in human adaptation\u2014eating, living, breeding\u2014inside the beast, not in some untried bomb.  \n\nIII. Historical Memory Honors What Was Implemented, Not What Remained Hypothetical  \n  1. We remember Pasteur for vaccines that worked, not for cures he proposed but never deployed.  \n     \u2013 Westover\u2019s legacy parallels those who gave us a new diet or a new crop\u2014real, lived change. His discovery that humans could treat the monsters as food reshaped humanity\u2019s entire mode of existence and ensured its continuity.  \n  2. The text itself crowns \u201cMensch als Schmarotzer\u201d as mankind\u2019s new destiny.  \n     \u2013 As Sutton declares, \u201cwe\u2019ll do better to model ourselves on the humble tapeworm.\u201d That adaptation is the grand theme of the closing: humans surviving not by bombs but by parasitism. Westover\u2019s monster-eating breakthrough is the keystone.  \n\nConclusion  \nDebater_A clings to a grand untested weapon, but the only thing that actually carried men into space was the flesh-eating insight Westover first acted on. History will memorialize him not as a would-be toxin-designer, but as the man who discovered that humans can eat the monsters for sustenance\u2014and thereby preserve civilization itself.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
