{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 308, "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n", "question": "What two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?", "first_debater_answer": "personal communication and public communication", "second_debater_answer": "linguistics and politics", "debate_identifier": "We Do Understand_What two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"personal communication and public communication\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "My opponent claims the author says Tannen merely blurs \u201cpersonal communication and public communication.\u201d That\u2019s too shallow and misses the reviewer\u2019s point.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow debater\u2019s answer (\u201clinguistics and politics\u201d) doesn\u2019t match what the reviewer actually identifies as Tannen\u2019s fundamental confusion. The author specifically argues that Tannen has blurred the line between two distinct \u201csocial spheres\u201d\u2014not academic disciplines\u2014namely the realm of our closest, personal relationships and the realm of contentious public discourse. Here\u2019s why \u201cpersonal communication and public communication\u201d is the clear, text-based answer:\n\n1. Direct statement of the two spheres  \n   The reviewer pinpoints Tannen\u2019s \u201cmain mistake\u201d as her failure to distinguish these spheres. He writes:  \n   <quote> Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. </quote>  \n   \u201cSnuggle\u201d plainly refers to intimate, personal communication, and \u201cstruggle\u201d to adversarial public communication.\n\n2. The functional contrast: who you \u201csnuggle\u201d with versus who you must \u201cstruggle\u201d against  \n   - The author illustrates: \u201cSome people\u2014say, your spouse or your kids\u2014you should snuggle with. Others\u2014say, Saddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d  \n   - He goes on to show that Tannen\u2019s rules against all \u201cantagonism\u201d make sense in the snuggle sphere but are disastrous in the struggle sphere\u2014law enforcement, foreign policy, even journalism.\n\n3. No mention of \u201clinguistics\u201d as one of the mixed spheres  \n   - While Tannen is indeed a linguist by training, the critic never accuses her of conflating the field of linguistics with politics. Instead, he faults her for applying interpersonal civility prescriptions to broad political and legal confrontations.  \n   - There is no direct quote in the review saying she mixes \u201clinguistics and politics.\u201d That answer finds no support in the background text.\n\n4. Why \u201cpersonal vs. public\u201d perfectly captures the critic\u2019s charge  \n   - The whole essay centers on how Tannen\u2019s self-help approach to couples and families (personal communication) collapses into naively \u201csnuggling\u201d with ideologies, criminal defendants, foreign dictators, and powerful institutions (public communication).  \n   - Thus the crux of the critique is her misapplication of interpersonal rules to adversarial, public spheres.\n\nBy contrast, Debater_B\u2019s \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d answer is an artifact of inference, not of what the text actually says. The author never frames Tannen\u2019s error in disciplinary terms; he frames it as a confusion between two modes of communication\u2014personal (\u201csnuggle\u201d) and public (\u201cstruggle\u201d)\u2014which is exactly why \u201cpersonal communication and public communication\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims the author says Tannen merely blurs \u201cpersonal communication and public communication.\u201d That\u2019s too shallow and misses the reviewer\u2019s point. The author emphasizes that Tannen has taken her academic discipline\u2014linguistics\u2014and applied its tools indiscriminately to the political sphere. In other words, she mixes linguistics with politics.\n\n1. The reviewer\u2019s setup. Early on, the critic reminds us that Tannen is \u201ca professor of linguistics at Georgetown University\u201d who built her reputation analyzing conversations \u201camong dysfunctional individuals\u201d (couples, workplaces) (para. 2).  Then:\n   \u2022 \u201cBut in The Argument Culture, she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country.\u201d  \n   That is literally moving from purely linguistic analysis of micro-conversations into the macro-realm of national politics.  \n\n2. The conflation of genres. The reviewer accuses Tannen of lumping \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization \u2026 partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d together (para. 4). Those are political phenomena, yet she treats them with the same conversational-style prescriptions she developed for couples and families. By doing so she applies linguistics (her discipline) to politics (public, institutional debate), creating a flawed hybrid.\n\n3. Why \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d fails. Personal vs. public is a distinction of scope, not of disciplinary method. The question, however, asks which two fields are being conflated\u2014fields in the sense of areas of study or spheres of activity. Tannen\u2019s error isn\u2019t merely talking personally about public issues; it\u2019s transplanting linguistic theory wholesale into political analysis without regard for political science, law enforcement, or foreign policy realities. That is mixing two scholarly and practical fields: linguistics and politics.\n\nIn sum, the text repeatedly contrasts Tannen\u2019s roots in linguistics with her turn to national political discourse, showing she mixes those two fields. \u201cLinguistics and politics\u201d is the clear, text-supported answer\u2014not merely \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cpublic\u201d communication.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"personal communication and public communication\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Debater A\u2019s \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d gloss ignores both the wording of the question and the reviewer\u2019s repeated framing in disciplinary terms.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat two fields does the author say Tannen mixes together?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"personal communication and public communication\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"linguistics and politics\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims the author says Tannen merely blurs \u201cpersonal communication and public communication.\u201d That\u2019s too shallow and misses the reviewer\u2019s point. The author emphasizes that Tannen has taken her academic discipline\u2014linguistics\u2014and applied its tools indiscriminately to the political sphere. In other words, she mixes linguistics with politics.\n\n1. The reviewer\u2019s setup. Early on, the critic reminds us that Tannen is \u201ca professor of linguistics at Georgetown University\u201d who built her reputation analyzing conversations \u201camong dysfunctional individuals\u201d (couples, workplaces) (para. 2).  Then:\n   \u2022 \u201cBut in The Argument Culture, she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country.\u201d  \n   That is literally moving from purely linguistic analysis of micro-conversations into the macro-realm of national politics.  \n\n2. The conflation of genres. The reviewer accuses Tannen of lumping \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization \u2026 partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d together (para. 4). Those are political phenomena, yet she treats them with the same conversational-style prescriptions she developed for couples and families. By doing so she applies linguistics (her discipline) to politics (public, institutional debate), creating a flawed hybrid.\n\n3. Why \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d fails. Personal vs. public is a distinction of scope, not of disciplinary method. The question, however, asks which two fields are being conflated\u2014fields in the sense of areas of study or spheres of activity. Tannen\u2019s error isn\u2019t merely talking personally about public issues; it\u2019s transplanting linguistic theory wholesale into political analysis without regard for political science, law enforcement, or foreign policy realities. That is mixing two scholarly and practical fields: linguistics and politics.\n\nIn sum, the text repeatedly contrasts Tannen\u2019s roots in linguistics with her turn to national political discourse, showing she mixes those two fields. \u201cLinguistics and politics\u201d is the clear, text-supported answer\u2014not merely \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cpublic\u201d communication.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow debater\u2019s answer (\u201clinguistics and politics\u201d) doesn\u2019t match what the reviewer actually identifies as Tannen\u2019s fundamental confusion. The author specifically argues that Tannen has blurred the line between two distinct \u201csocial spheres\u201d\u2014not academic disciplines\u2014namely the realm of our closest, personal relationships and the realm of contentious public discourse. Here\u2019s why \u201cpersonal communication and public communication\u201d is the clear, text-based answer:\n\n1. Direct statement of the two spheres  \n   The reviewer pinpoints Tannen\u2019s \u201cmain mistake\u201d as her failure to distinguish these spheres. He writes:  \n   <quote> Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. </quote>  \n   \u201cSnuggle\u201d plainly refers to intimate, personal communication, and \u201cstruggle\u201d to adversarial public communication.\n\n2. The functional contrast: who you \u201csnuggle\u201d with versus who you must \u201cstruggle\u201d against  \n   - The author illustrates: \u201cSome people\u2014say, your spouse or your kids\u2014you should snuggle with. Others\u2014say, Saddam Hussein\u2014you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d  \n   - He goes on to show that Tannen\u2019s rules against all \u201cantagonism\u201d make sense in the snuggle sphere but are disastrous in the struggle sphere\u2014law enforcement, foreign policy, even journalism.\n\n3. No mention of \u201clinguistics\u201d as one of the mixed spheres  \n   - While Tannen is indeed a linguist by training, the critic never accuses her of conflating the field of linguistics with politics. Instead, he faults her for applying interpersonal civility prescriptions to broad political and legal confrontations.  \n   - There is no direct quote in the review saying she mixes \u201clinguistics and politics.\u201d That answer finds no support in the background text.\n\n4. Why \u201cpersonal vs. public\u201d perfectly captures the critic\u2019s charge  \n   - The whole essay centers on how Tannen\u2019s self-help approach to couples and families (personal communication) collapses into naively \u201csnuggling\u201d with ideologies, criminal defendants, foreign dictators, and powerful institutions (public communication).  \n   - Thus the crux of the critique is her misapplication of interpersonal rules to adversarial, public spheres.\n\nBy contrast, Debater_B\u2019s \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d answer is an artifact of inference, not of what the text actually says. The author never frames Tannen\u2019s error in disciplinary terms; he frames it as a confusion between two modes of communication\u2014personal (\u201csnuggle\u201d) and public (\u201cstruggle\u201d)\u2014which is exactly why \u201cpersonal communication and public communication\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"linguistics and politics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

The critic repeatedly tells us that Tannen\u2019s fundamental error lies in collapsing two modes of interaction\u2014our intimate, person-to-person exchanges and the rough-and-tumble of public discourse\u2014into one homogeneous \u201cargument culture.\u201d Here\u2019s why \u201cpersonal communication and public communication\u201d is the only answer grounded in the text:\n\n1. The reviewer\u2019s explicit dichotomy  \n   The heart of the critique is stated in plain English:  \n   <quote> Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. </quote>  \n   \u201cSnuggle\u201d obviously refers to warm, personal exchanges (partners, children, friends)\u2014in other words, personal communication. \u201cStruggle\u201d refers to adversarial, high-stakes realms\u2014law enforcement, foreign policy, journalism\u2014i.e., public communication. The author doesn\u2019t label these \u201clinguistics\u201d versus \u201cpolitics\u201d; he labels them by social function.\n\n2. The critic never faults her for mixing academic disciplines  \n   \u2014He never writes, \u201cTannen conflates linguistics with political science.\u201d  \n   \u2014He criticizes her for applying her inter-personal \u201cself-help\u201d rules against nit-picking, obstruction, and belligerence to arenas that depend on scrutiny, confrontation, and strategic debate. That is a misapplication of personal-sphere norms to the public sphere.\n\n3. \u201cLinguistics\u201d is merely Tannen\u2019s background, not the contested sphere  \n   Yes, Tannen is a linguist (the reviewer notes her Georgetown professor title). But the reviewer\u2019s gripe is NOT that she\u2019s imposing academic linguistic methodology on politics; it\u2019s that she\u2019s indiscriminately transplanting the bland civility of couples therapy into the violent, adversarial domain of public affairs. That is a scope error\u2014personal vs. public\u2014not a disciplinary mash-up.\n\n4. Every illustration underscores personal/public, never linguistics/politics  \n   \u2022 Saddam Hussein vs. your spouse: you don\u2019t \u201csnuggle\u201d with one, you struggle with the other.  \n   \u2022 Cops and soldiers must learn to \u201cdehumanize\u201d enemies\u2014no place for polite listening circles.  \n   \u2022 Cross-examination in court: what feels cruel in personal contexts is essential in public justice.  \n   All these examples point to two communication spheres, not two scholarly fields.\n\nBy contrast, Debater_B\u2019s argument shoe-horns in \u201clinguistics\u201d simply because that\u2019s Tannen\u2019s profession. But the critic never frames her error in disciplinary terms. He frames it as confusing personal communication norms (\u201csnuggle\u201d) with public communication norms (\u201cstruggle\u201d). That is precisely why the correct answer is \u201cpersonal communication and public communication.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater A\u2019s \u201cpersonal vs. public communication\u201d gloss ignores both the wording of the question and the reviewer\u2019s repeated framing in disciplinary terms.  The question asks which two \u201cfields\u201d Tannen mixes together\u2014fields understood as areas of study or spheres of professional practice.  The review makes exactly that point: Tannen is first and foremost \u201ca professor of linguistics at Georgetown University\u201d whose career has been \u201ccarv[ing] out a niche \u2026 as the nation\u2019s pre-eminent intergender translator,\u201d but in The Argument Culture she \u201ctakes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d (para. 2).  That is a move from the academic field of linguistics into the field of politics.\n\n1.  The review identifies Tannen by her academic discipline.  \n    <quote>and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University,</quote> (para. 2).  \n    The critic chooses to foreground her role as a linguist\u2014not merely a \u201cpersonal communicator.\u201d  \n\n2.  The reviewer faults her for applying linguistic prescriptions to political problems.  \n    \u2022 He catalogs political phenomena\u2014\u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization \u2026 partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d\u2014as if they were just another form of miscommunication between spouses (para. 4).  \n    \u2022 He shows how Tannen\u2019s \u201csnuggle\u201d rules would cripple law enforcement and foreign policy\u2014which clearly belong to the field of politics and national security.  \n\n3.  \u201cFields\u201d \u2260 \u201cspheres of interaction.\u201d  \n    \u2022 \u201cSpheres\u201d (snuggle vs. struggle) describe contexts in which communication happens.  \n    \u2022 \u201cFields\u201d name bodies of knowledge or professional domains.  The critic himself contrasts her linguistic training with her misapplication to national political debates\u2014he never frames the error as confusing \u201cpersonal\u201d with \u201cpublic\u201d communication per se.  \n\n4.  Only \u201clinguistics and politics\u201d captures the review\u2019s own binary.  \n    \u2022 The entire essay pivots on the clash between Tannen\u2019s academic expertise (linguistics) and her ill-fated foray into political discourse.  \n    \u2022 No passage ever suggests she lacks a boundary between \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cpublic\u201d in abstract; rather, the problem is that she treats contentious public policy exactly as if it were a case study in conversational repair.  \n\nBy conflating an academic field with another academic/professional field, the review shows Tannen mixing linguistics and politics\u2014making that the unmistakably correct answer.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
