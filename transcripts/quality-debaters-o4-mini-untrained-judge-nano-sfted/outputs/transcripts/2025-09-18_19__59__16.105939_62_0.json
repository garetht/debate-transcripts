    "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n",

In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are the elements that the author seems most perplexed by in the inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date.

That consistent tone of perplexity across multiple issues is the heart of his critique.\n\n2. By contrast, the \u201cLet us\u2009\u2026\u201d phrase is described in purely neutral, diagnostic terms\u2014and never as a source of bafflement.  \n   \u2022 He calls it \u201ca telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural\u201d and traces its frequency in JFK and Nixon, but he never says, \u201cI\u2019m amazed by this,\u201d or \u201cHow could presidents do this?\u201d It\u2019s simply an illustrative detail of the theatrical phase.  \n   \u2022 There is no expression of moral or intellectual surprise attached to the phrase\u2014no \u201cdisturbing,\u201d \u201camazing,\u201d or \u201cperplexing.\u201d It is a stylistic marker, not a puzzle.\n\n3. The question asks for the elements the author finds most perplexing. Notice that plural: he isn\u2019t zeroing in on a single rhetorical tic but on a recurring pattern of substantive silence. Those omissions span topics\u2014women, race, foreign policy issues, economic warning\u2014which together constitute the \u201celements\u201d that perplex him. In fact, the author closes by urging humility, reminding us that future readers \u201cwill shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today.\u201d That reflection stems entirely from noticing what presidents omitted, not from marveling at a repeated phrase.\n\n4. Debater_B conflates a single stylistic observation with the multiple substantive \u201choles\u201d that the author continually returns to with a tone of moral and historical astonishment. Only the hot-topic omissions carry that tone.  \n\nTherefore, the clear, text-based answer is that the author is most perplexed by \u201cthe lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras,\u201d not by any single recurring phrase.",

That consistent tone of perplexity across multiple issues is the heart of his critique.\n\n2. By contrast, the \u201cLet us\u2009\u2026\u201d phrase is described in purely neutral, diagnostic terms\u2014and never as a source of bafflement.  \n   \u2022 He calls it \u201ca telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural\u201d and traces its frequency in JFK and Nixon, but he never says, \u201cI\u2019m amazed by this,\u201d or \u201cHow could presidents do this?\u201d It\u2019s simply an illustrative detail of the theatrical phase.  \n   \u2022 There is no expression of moral or intellectual surprise attached to the phrase\u2014no \u201cdisturbing,\u201d \u201camazing,\u201d or \u201cperplexing.\u201d It is a stylistic marker, not a puzzle.\n\n3. The question asks for the elements the author finds most perplexing. Notice that plural: he isn\u2019t zeroing in on a single rhetorical tic but on a recurring pattern of substantive silence. Those omissions span topics\u2014women, race, foreign policy issues, economic warning\u2014which together constitute the \u201celements\u201d that perplex him. In fact, the author closes by urging humility, reminding us that future readers \u201cwill shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today.\u201d That reflection stems entirely from noticing what presidents omitted, not from marveling at a repeated phrase.\n\n4. Debater_B conflates a single stylistic observation with the multiple substantive \u201choles\u201d that the author continually returns to with a tone of moral and historical astonishment. Only the hot-topic omissions carry that tone.  \n\nTherefore, the clear, text-based answer is that the author is most perplexed by \u201cthe lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras,\u201d not by any single recurring phrase.",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are the elements that the author seems most perplexed by in the inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position\u2014that the author\u2019s chief perplexity lies in \u201cthe lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\u201d\u2014is supported by numerous passages. By contrast, Debater_B\u2019s claim that the author is most struck by \u201cthe consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\u201d is unsupported and misunderstands both emphasis and evidence in the text.\n\n1.  The author repeatedly points out striking silences on major issues of their day\u2014what I call \u201chot topics.\u201d For example:  \n    \u2022  On women\u2019s issues: \u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear at all until Wilson\u2019s first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \u2018men and women,\u2019 never as referring to any special concerns of women.\u201d (Background text)  \n    \u2022  On Native Americans, Prohibition, territorial expansion, etc.: \u201cMany an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition.\u201d (Background text)  \n    \u2022  On race relations: \u201cThe words \u2018black,\u2019 \u2018blacks,\u2019 \u2018Negro,\u2019 or \u2018race\u2019 (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877,\u201d and later, FDR \u201cnever mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals.\u201d (Background text)\n\n2.  The author explicitly calls this silence \u201cthe most amazing\u201d and \u201cthe most disturbing aspect of the whole series\u201d:  \n    \u2022  \u201cWhat is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women.\u201d  \n    \u2022  \u201cThe most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations\u2026\u201d (Background text)\n\n3.  By contrast, the observation about \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d appears only once, is treated briefly, and is clearly not the focus of the author\u2019s perplexity. He writes:  \n    \u2022  \u201cA telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \u2018Let us \u2026\u2019\u201d  \n    \u2022  He then gives examples of JFK and Nixon. Yet there is no expression of bafflement or moral judgment about this phrase; it\u2019s described simply as a \u201ctelltale sign.\u201d (Background text)\n\n4.  The question asks: \u201cWhat elements is the author most perplexed by?\u201d Only the repeated remarks on omissions carry the tone of puzzlement and critique\u2014he cannot believe presidents so often failed to speak on slavery before the Civil War, on women until 1913, on lynching without horror, or on Hitler in 1937. Nothing comparable is said about the ubiquity of \u201cLet us.\u201d\n\n5.  Finally, Debater_B\u2019s position conflates a stylistic trend (the pulpit-style \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d) with the substantive concerns the author continually returns to\u2014the very \u201choles\u201d in presidential rhetoric. Those substantive absences are, in the author\u2019s own words, \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cdisturbing,\u201d whereas the rhetorical device is merely descriptive.\n\nTherefore, it is abundantly clear from the text that the author is most perplexed by the repeated omission of pressing issues\u2014hot topics\u2014across the history of inaugural addresses, not by any single recurring phrase.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s \u201chot\u2010topic omissions\u201d thesis collapses under scrutiny of the text.  The author does point out subjects that vanish\u2014women, race, economic warning\u2014but he never calls those silences the single \u201celement\u201d that most puzzles him.  Instead, he highlights again and again one unmistakable stylistic tic that runs through inaugurals of every era:\n\n1.  The author labels \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d a \u201ctelltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural.\u201d  He defines it as presidents literally commanding their audiences\u2014\u201cYou do as I say\u201d\u2014and notes its growth from occasional to routine:\n   \u2022  \u201cThis expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years.\u201d\n   \u2022  \u201cJohn F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one.\u201d\n\n2.  He even traces its pedigree to Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cbully pulpit,\u201d arguing that advances in radio and television turned the speech into a sermon more than a policy blueprint.  No other repeated phrase\u2014or any other single stylistic feature\u2014is given that level of attention or labeled so explicitly \u201ctelltale.\u201d\n\n3.  Contrast: while Debater_A treats missing subjects as a unified puzzle, the author\u2019s structure treats omissions as side notes.  Race relations and women rate long discussions, but each appears in a distinct section headed by topic.  By contrast, \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d is woven into his core narrative about the phase\u2010shift from classic modesty to theatrical leader\u2010preacher.  It\u2019s the one phrase he returns to as evidence of the modern inaugural\u2019s defining character.\n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s \u201cperplexity\u201d centers on this relentless, across-the-board use of \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d as a unifying rhetorical device.  That is the single element he finds most striking\u2014and the correct answer to the question.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Only one element is singled out as the hallmark of the last phase: \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d  \n   \u2022 This is the single thread he weaves through his overarching argument.  \n   \u2022 No other phrase or omission is afforded the same narrative role.\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s focus on \u201chot-topic silences\u201d mistakes the author\u2019s thematic critiques for the element he finds perplexing in inaugurals themselves. Omissions provoke moral outrage, but they do not drive his analysis of how inaugurals have changed over time.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s principal perplexity lies in the relentless, cross-era recurrence of the phrase \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d\u2014the hallmark of the modern inaugural\u2019s leader-preacher style. That is the single element he foregrounds as puzzling and transformation-defining.",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are the elements that the author seems most perplexed by in the inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s \u201chot\u2010topic omissions\u201d thesis collapses under scrutiny of the text.  The author does point out subjects that vanish\u2014women, race, economic warning\u2014but he never calls those silences the single \u201celement\u201d that most puzzles him.  Instead, he highlights again and again one unmistakable stylistic tic that runs through inaugurals of every era:\n\n1.  The author labels \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d a \u201ctelltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural.\u201d  He defines it as presidents literally commanding their audiences\u2014\u201cYou do as I say\u201d\u2014and notes its growth from occasional to routine:\n   \u2022  \u201cThis expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years.\u201d\n   \u2022  \u201cJohn F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one.\u201d\n\n2.  He even traces its pedigree to Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cbully pulpit,\u201d arguing that advances in radio and television turned the speech into a sermon more than a policy blueprint.  No other repeated phrase\u2014or any other single stylistic feature\u2014is given that level of attention or labeled so explicitly \u201ctelltale.\u201d\n\n3.  Contrast: while Debater_A treats missing subjects as a unified puzzle, the author\u2019s structure treats omissions as side notes.  Race relations and women rate long discussions, but each appears in a distinct section headed by topic.  By contrast, \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d is woven into his core narrative about the phase\u2010shift from classic modesty to theatrical leader\u2010preacher.  It\u2019s the one phrase he returns to as evidence of the modern inaugural\u2019s defining character.\n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s \u201cperplexity\u201d centers on this relentless, across-the-board use of \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d as a unifying rhetorical device.  That is the single element he finds most striking\u2014and the correct answer to the question.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position\u2014that the author\u2019s chief perplexity lies in \u201cthe lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\u201d\u2014is supported by numerous passages. By contrast, Debater_B\u2019s claim that the author is most struck by \u201cthe consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\u201d is unsupported and misunderstands both emphasis and evidence in the text.\n\n1.  The author repeatedly points out striking silences on major issues of their day\u2014what I call \u201chot topics.\u201d For example:  \n    \u2022  On women\u2019s issues: \u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear at all until Wilson\u2019s first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \u2018men and women,\u2019 never as referring to any special concerns of women.\u201d (Background text)  \n    \u2022  On Native Americans, Prohibition, territorial expansion, etc.: \u201cMany an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition.\u201d (Background text)  \n    \u2022  On race relations: \u201cThe words \u2018black,\u2019 \u2018blacks,\u2019 \u2018Negro,\u2019 or \u2018race\u2019 (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877,\u201d and later, FDR \u201cnever mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals.\u201d (Background text)\n\n2.  The author explicitly calls this silence \u201cthe most amazing\u201d and \u201cthe most disturbing aspect of the whole series\u201d:  \n    \u2022  \u201cWhat is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women.\u201d  \n    \u2022  \u201cThe most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations\u2026\u201d (Background text)\n\n3.  By contrast, the observation about \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d appears only once, is treated briefly, and is clearly not the focus of the author\u2019s perplexity. He writes:  \n    \u2022  \u201cA telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \u2018Let us \u2026\u2019\u201d  \n    \u2022  He then gives examples of JFK and Nixon. Yet there is no expression of bafflement or moral judgment about this phrase; it\u2019s described simply as a \u201ctelltale sign.\u201d (Background text)\n\n4.  The question asks: \u201cWhat elements is the author most perplexed by?\u201d Only the repeated remarks on omissions carry the tone of puzzlement and critique\u2014he cannot believe presidents so often failed to speak on slavery before the Civil War, on women until 1913, on lynching without horror, or on Hitler in 1937. Nothing comparable is said about the ubiquity of \u201cLet us.\u201d\n\n5.  Finally, Debater_B\u2019s position conflates a stylistic trend (the pulpit-style \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d) with the substantive concerns the author continually returns to\u2014the very \u201choles\u201d in presidential rhetoric. Those substantive absences are, in the author\u2019s own words, \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cdisturbing,\u201d whereas the rhetorical device is merely descriptive.\n\nTherefore, it is abundantly clear from the text that the author is most perplexed by the repeated omission of pressing issues\u2014hot topics\u2014across the history of inaugural addresses, not by any single recurring phrase.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Instead, he highlights again and again one unmistakable stylistic tic that runs through inaugurals of every era:\n\n1.  The author labels \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d a \u201ctelltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural.\u201d  He defines it as presidents literally commanding their audiences\u2014\u201cYou do as I say\u201d\u2014and notes its growth from occasional to routine:\n   \u2022  \u201cThis expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years.\u201d\n   \u2022  \u201cJohn F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one.\u201d\n\n2.  He even traces its pedigree to Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cbully pulpit,\u201d arguing that advances in radio and television turned the speech into a sermon more than a policy blueprint.  No other repeated phrase\u2014or any other single stylistic feature\u2014is given that level of attention or labeled so explicitly \u201ctelltale.\u201d\n\n3.  Contrast: while Debater_A treats missing subjects as a unified puzzle, the author\u2019s structure treats omissions as side notes.  Race relations and women rate long discussions, but each appears in a distinct section headed by topic.  By contrast, \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d is woven into his core narrative about the phase\u2010shift from classic modesty to theatrical leader\u2010preacher.  It\u2019s the one phrase he returns to as evidence of the modern inaugural\u2019s defining character.\n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s \u201cperplexity\u201d centers on this relentless, across-the-board use of \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d as a unifying rhetorical device.  That is the single element he finds most striking\u2014and the correct answer to the question.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s case collapses on two fronts: first, on what the author actually emphasizes as \u201cpuzzling\u201d or \u201cperplexing,\u201d and second, on the plurality and substance of the question itself.\n\n1. The author repeatedly flags omissions on pressing issues\u2014and does so with language of amazement and distress.  \n   \u2022 On women: \u201cWhat is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear at all until Wilson\u2019s first inaugural\u2009\u2026\u2009never as referring to any special concerns of women.\u201d <quote> what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. </quote>  \n   \u2022 On race: \u201cThe most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations\u2009\u2026\u2009The words \u2018black,\u2019 \u2018blacks,\u2019 \u2018Negro,\u2019 or \u2018race\u2019\u2009\u2026\u2009do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877.\u201d <quote> The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, </quote>  \n   \u2022 On other \u201chot topics\u201d: \u201cMany an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition.\u201d <quote> Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. </quote>  \n\n   In each case the author isn\u2019t neutral or merely descriptive\u2014he is amazed, disturbed, even shocked that presidents failed to address \u201chot topics\u201d central to their day. That consistent tone of perplexity across multiple issues is the heart of his critique.\n\n2. By contrast, the \u201cLet us\u2009\u2026\u201d phrase is described in purely neutral, diagnostic terms\u2014and never as a source of bafflement.  \n   \u2022 He calls it \u201ca telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural\u201d and traces its frequency in JFK and Nixon, but he never says, \u201cI\u2019m amazed by this,\u201d or \u201cHow could presidents do this?\u201d It\u2019s simply an illustrative detail of the theatrical phase.  \n   \u2022 There is no expression of moral or intellectual surprise attached to the phrase\u2014no \u201cdisturbing,\u201d \u201camazing,\u201d or \u201cperplexing.\u201d It is a stylistic marker, not a puzzle.\n\n3. The question asks for the elements the author finds most perplexing. Notice that plural: he isn\u2019t zeroing in on a single rhetorical tic but on a recurring pattern of substantive silence. Those omissions span topics\u2014women, race, foreign policy issues, economic warning\u2014which together constitute the \u201celements\u201d that perplex him. In fact, the author closes by urging humility, reminding us that future readers \u201cwill shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today.\u201d That reflection stems entirely from noticing what presidents omitted, not from marveling at a repeated phrase.\n\n4. Debater_B conflates a single stylistic observation with the multiple substantive \u201choles\u201d that the author continually returns to with a tone of moral and historical astonishment. Only the hot-topic omissions carry that tone.  \n\nTherefore, the clear, text-based answer is that the author is most perplexed by \u201cthe lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras,\u201d not by any single recurring phrase.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A misreads \u201cperplexed\u201d as mere \u201cdisturbance.\u201d The author does criticize silences on women and race, calling them \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cdisturbing.\u201d But those are moral judgments of content, not perplexity about the speeches\u2019 defining character. The question asks what element in the speeches themselves puzzles him\u2014what unifies them stylistically\u2014rather than which topics he laments are missing.\n\n2. The only feature the author explicitly brands \u201ctelltale\u201d of a phase and returns to as evidence of a sea-change is the phrase \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d  \n   \u2022 He labels it \u201ca telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural.\u201d  \n   \u2022 He traces its growth\u2014from occasional use to JFK\u2019s 16 repetitions and Nixon\u2019s 22\u2014showing it underpins the third phase.  \n   \u2022 He ties it to Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cbully pulpit\u201d and the advent of radio and television, explaining why that phrase matters for understanding how inaugurals evolved from policy statements to sermons.\n\n3. By contrast, the discussions of omissions are scattered under separate thematic headings\u2014\u201cwomen,\u201d \u201crace,\u201d \u201ctaxes\u201d\u2014and treated as curiosities of content, not as the unifying lines the author finds most striking. They do not appear in the phase-shift narrative that structures the essay.  \n\n4. The author\u2019s core narrative hinges on three stylistic phases\u2014from modest classicism, through prosaic executive-speak, to theatrical leader-preaching. Only one element is singled out as the hallmark of the last phase: \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d  \n   \u2022 This is the single thread he weaves through his overarching argument.  \n   \u2022 No other phrase or omission is afforded the same narrative role.\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s focus on \u201chot-topic silences\u201d mistakes the author\u2019s thematic critiques for the element he finds perplexing in inaugurals themselves. Omissions provoke moral outrage, but they do not drive his analysis of how inaugurals have changed over time.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s principal perplexity lies in the relentless, cross-era recurrence of the phrase \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d\u2014the hallmark of the modern inaugural\u2019s leader-preacher style. That is the single element he foregrounds as puzzling and transformation-defining.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
