    "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n",

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls.

But each of these is embedded in a paragraph dripping with derision\u2014\u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets,\u201d \u201cnotably more pollution than in the United States,\u201d \u201cminiskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?)\u201d The parenthetical question is mocking rather than admiring.  \n   \u2022 These passing mentions do not constitute a tonal pivot; they merely add texture to the critique, showing that even Brussels\u2019s so-called virtues coexist with glaring absurdities.\n\n3. There is no gradual tonal arc\u2014only a relentless escalation of critique.  \n   \u2022 B argues that the author moves from \u201cintrigue\u201d to \u201cdread.\u201d In fact, the tone is equally corrosive at each stage: from the demolition of Belgian politics and infrastructure, to the lampooning of labor strikes and work rules (<quote>overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure</quote>), to the excoriation of telecom monopolies and euro-related debt gamesmanship.  \n   \u2022 Each section ratchets up the severity of the attack, but none ever softens. That is consistent opposition, not a two-phase shift.\n\n4. The EU\u2019s headquarters and Berlaymont asbestos debacle are just more installments in an uninterrupted litany of incompetence.  \n   \u2022 B portrays the comparison to Foggy Bottom as evidence of disappointment. But the author never says U.S. offices are better\u2014he simply uses them as a rhetorical foil to highlight Brussels\u2019s opulence.  \n   \u2022 Labeling Belgium \u201cthe second-most corrupt European state\u201d (<quote>second-most corrupt European state</quote>) is not the endpoint of a tonal evolution but one more data point in a withering portrait of ineptitude.\n\n5. Debater_B misreads irony for hope.  \n   \u2022 Mock-praising \u201cthinking ahead,\u201d \u201cemerging,\u201d \u201cenlightened attitudes,\u201d or \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d only to pivot immediately to caustic commentary is the author\u2019s consistent strategy. He never abandons the scornful lens.  \n   \u2022 A truly hopeful opening would linger on successes; here, every \u201cgood\u201d detail is offset by ridicule or framed as a bizarre idiosyncrasy.\n\nConclusion  \nThere is no credible evidence of a genuine optimistic tone at any point\u2014only unbroken sarcasm and disapproval. Thus the author \u201cremains steadfastly in opposition to their subject\u201d throughout. Debater_B\u2019s imagined tonal shift is a misinterpretation of satire as sincerity. My opponent\u2019s thesis cannot withstand the clear, continuous negativity that permeates every paragraph.",

But each of these is embedded in a paragraph dripping with derision\u2014\u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets,\u201d \u201cnotably more pollution than in the United States,\u201d \u201cminiskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?)\u201d The parenthetical question is mocking rather than admiring.  \n   \u2022 These passing mentions do not constitute a tonal pivot; they merely add texture to the critique, showing that even Brussels\u2019s so-called virtues coexist with glaring absurdities.\n\n3. There is no gradual tonal arc\u2014only a relentless escalation of critique.  \n   \u2022 B argues that the author moves from \u201cintrigue\u201d to \u201cdread.\u201d In fact, the tone is equally corrosive at each stage: from the demolition of Belgian politics and infrastructure, to the lampooning of labor strikes and work rules (<quote>overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure</quote>), to the excoriation of telecom monopolies and euro-related debt gamesmanship.  \n   \u2022 Each section ratchets up the severity of the attack, but none ever softens. That is consistent opposition, not a two-phase shift.\n\n4. The EU\u2019s headquarters and Berlaymont asbestos debacle are just more installments in an uninterrupted litany of incompetence.  \n   \u2022 B portrays the comparison to Foggy Bottom as evidence of disappointment. But the author never says U.S. offices are better\u2014he simply uses them as a rhetorical foil to highlight Brussels\u2019s opulence.  \n   \u2022 Labeling Belgium \u201cthe second-most corrupt European state\u201d (<quote>second-most corrupt European state</quote>) is not the endpoint of a tonal evolution but one more data point in a withering portrait of ineptitude.\n\n5. Debater_B misreads irony for hope.  \n   \u2022 Mock-praising \u201cthinking ahead,\u201d \u201cemerging,\u201d \u201cenlightened attitudes,\u201d or \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d only to pivot immediately to caustic commentary is the author\u2019s consistent strategy. He never abandons the scornful lens.  \n   \u2022 A truly hopeful opening would linger on successes; here, every \u201cgood\u201d detail is offset by ridicule or framed as a bizarre idiosyncrasy.\n\nConclusion  \nThere is no credible evidence of a genuine optimistic tone at any point\u2014only unbroken sarcasm and disapproval. Thus the author \u201cremains steadfastly in opposition to their subject\u201d throughout. Debater_B\u2019s imagined tonal shift is a misinterpretation of satire as sincerity. My opponent\u2019s thesis cannot withstand the clear, continuous negativity that permeates every paragraph.",

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nI Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author\u2019s tone shift over the course of the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s \u201cstart hopeful, grow dismayed\u201d thesis can\u2019t survive the text\u2019s opening lines\u2014and indeed the entire essay remains relentlessly negative about Brussels and the European Union. My position\u2014\u201cThey remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\u201d\u2014better matches the author\u2019s tone, which is critical from sentence one and never takes on a hopeful cast.\n\n1.  No hint of optimism at the outset  \n    \u2022  Right in the title and first paragraph the author mocks Brussels as \u201cthe Capital of Europe\u201d and \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost\u201d (<quote>swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost</quote>).  \n    \u2022  That opening salvo is satire, not praise. If the author were hopeful at first, he would have drawn out successes or benefits; instead he leads with derision.\n\n2.  Consistent negative descriptors throughout  \n    \u2022  Belgians waste high incomes while the \u201cesprit social seems lacking\u201d (<quote>what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking</quote>), leaving infrastructure \u201ccrumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic\u201d (<quote>crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic</quote>).  \n    \u2022  Everyday life in Brussels is ridiculed\u2014no to-go coffee cups, \u201cJudas beer\u201d (<invalid_quote>Where a best-selling product\u2026is Judas beer</invalid_quote>), dogs in restaurants but not kids\u2014hardly hopeful scenes.\n\n3.  Continued scorn for politics, economy, and society  \n    \u2022  Strikes are described as inexplicable vandalism: ground crews \u201cran amok\u2026smashing the terminal\u2019s glass walls\u201d yet still demanding more money (<invalid_quote>ran amok\u2026smashing the terminal\u2019s glass walls\u2026then demanding more money</invalid_quote>).  \n    \u2022  The author decries work rules\u201432-hour weeks, unlimited sick days\u2014as stymying the economy, citing 10.9 percent unemployment versus half that in the U.S. (<quote>overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure</quote>).\n\n4.  Unrelenting critique of bureaucracy and corruption  \n    \u2022  The EU\u2019s HQ is a \u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power\u201d full of luxury and secrecy (<quote>cathedral to bureaucratic power</quote>), contrasted with run-down U.S. diplomatic offices.  \n    \u2022  He labels Belgium \u201cthe second\u2010most corrupt European state\u201d (<quote>second-most corrupt European state</quote>) and mocks the bungled asbestos cleanup at Berlaymont as emblematic of EU incompetence.\n\nDebater_B\u2019s model fails because there is no positive or neutral middle ground from which the author recoils\u2014there is only sustained satire and disapproval. At no point does the tone shift toward approval or even mild appreciation; occasional acknowledgments of cheap wine, fresh bread, or great chocolate are fleeting interludes in an otherwise scathing narrative. That proves the tone never veers from opposition, making \u201cThey remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\u201d the accurate reading.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that the author\u2019s tone \u201cstarts out hopeful and is slowly dismayed with further findings.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s claim that the author \u201cremains steadfastly in opposition\u201d ignores clear tonal development and selective optimism at the outset.\n\n1. Early optimism about Europe\u2019s promise  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s opening acknowledges the grand vision of the EU: \u201cThe Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \u2018Capital of Europe,\u2019 headquarters of the emerging European Union.\u201d That phrasing\u2014\u201cthinking ahead,\u201d \u201cemerging\u201d\u2014conveys genuine approval of forward-looking ambition.  \n   \u2022 He even finds small delights: \u201clobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; \u2026 ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.\u201d These details register positive engagement, not blanket hostility.  \n\n2. Gradual accumulation of disillusionment  \n   \u2022 After introducing these merits, the author catalogs failures: red tape, decaying infrastructure, constituency paralysis: \u201cCrumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic \u2026 is this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d The shift from descriptive wonder to questioning dread demonstrates tonal evolution.  \n   \u2022 Strikes and over-generous labor rules are introduced only after the tour of merits. He laments that \u201cretirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work\u2026 stymie the continent\u2019s economies,\u201d exposing a growing critical stance that builds on earlier goodwill.  \n\n3. Peak dismay in bureaucratic critique  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s depiction of the European Commission\u2019s headquarters and mismanagement marks tonal nadir: \u201cThis is the future of European government? \u2026 European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed.\u201d The detailed condemnation of asbestos bungling is the culmination of mounting dismay.  \n   \u2022 He contrasts this with U.S. government offices\u2014\u201cpaint is peeling,\u201d yet at least functional\u2014highlighting disappointment rather than sustained hostility.  \n\n4. Why Debater_A\u2019s \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d is inaccurate  \n   \u2022 Debater_A overlooks the author\u2019s initial warmth toward European culture and institutions. From admiring cheap wine and flowers to attending a 14th-century church, the author repeatedly records moments of genuine appreciation.  \n   \u2022 A strictly oppositional tone would have opened with denunciations, not with wonder at \u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars\u201d or \u201cbare breasts common in advertisements.\u201d The author\u2019s early fascination contradicts a static negative stance.\n\nConclusion  \nBy charting a clear trajectory from intrigue and cautious optimism to mounting frustration and outright dismay\u2014each stage marked by specific evidence\u2014the correct answer is that the author \u201cstarts out hopeful and is slowly dismayed with further findings.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s blanket-negative interpretation fails to account for this tonal arc.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author\u2019s tone shift over the course of the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that the author\u2019s tone \u201cstarts out hopeful and is slowly dismayed with further findings.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s claim that the author \u201cremains steadfastly in opposition\u201d ignores clear tonal development and selective optimism at the outset.\n\n1. Early optimism about Europe\u2019s promise  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s opening acknowledges the grand vision of the EU: \u201cThe Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \u2018Capital of Europe,\u2019 headquarters of the emerging European Union.\u201d That phrasing\u2014\u201cthinking ahead,\u201d \u201cemerging\u201d\u2014conveys genuine approval of forward-looking ambition.  \n   \u2022 He even finds small delights: \u201clobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; \u2026 ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.\u201d These details register positive engagement, not blanket hostility.  \n\n2. Gradual accumulation of disillusionment  \n   \u2022 After introducing these merits, the author catalogs failures: red tape, decaying infrastructure, constituency paralysis: \u201cCrumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic \u2026 is this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d The shift from descriptive wonder to questioning dread demonstrates tonal evolution.  \n   \u2022 Strikes and over-generous labor rules are introduced only after the tour of merits. He laments that \u201cretirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work\u2026 stymie the continent\u2019s economies,\u201d exposing a growing critical stance that builds on earlier goodwill.  \n\n3. Peak dismay in bureaucratic critique  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s depiction of the European Commission\u2019s headquarters and mismanagement marks tonal nadir: \u201cThis is the future of European government? \u2026 European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed.\u201d The detailed condemnation of asbestos bungling is the culmination of mounting dismay.  \n   \u2022 He contrasts this with U.S. government offices\u2014\u201cpaint is peeling,\u201d yet at least functional\u2014highlighting disappointment rather than sustained hostility.  \n\n4. Why Debater_A\u2019s \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d is inaccurate  \n   \u2022 Debater_A overlooks the author\u2019s initial warmth toward European culture and institutions. From admiring cheap wine and flowers to attending a 14th-century church, the author repeatedly records moments of genuine appreciation.  \n   \u2022 A strictly oppositional tone would have opened with denunciations, not with wonder at \u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars\u201d or \u201cbare breasts common in advertisements.\u201d The author\u2019s early fascination contradicts a static negative stance.\n\nConclusion  \nBy charting a clear trajectory from intrigue and cautious optimism to mounting frustration and outright dismay\u2014each stage marked by specific evidence\u2014the correct answer is that the author \u201cstarts out hopeful and is slowly dismayed with further findings.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s blanket-negative interpretation fails to account for this tonal arc.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s \u201cstart hopeful, grow dismayed\u201d thesis can\u2019t survive the text\u2019s opening lines\u2014and indeed the entire essay remains relentlessly negative about Brussels and the European Union. My position\u2014\u201cThey remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\u201d\u2014better matches the author\u2019s tone, which is critical from sentence one and never takes on a hopeful cast.\n\n1.  No hint of optimism at the outset  \n    \u2022  Right in the title and first paragraph the author mocks Brussels as \u201cthe Capital of Europe\u201d and \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost\u201d (<quote>swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost</quote>).  \n    \u2022  That opening salvo is satire, not praise. If the author were hopeful at first, he would have drawn out successes or benefits; instead he leads with derision.\n\n2.  Consistent negative descriptors throughout  \n    \u2022  Belgians waste high incomes while the \u201cesprit social seems lacking\u201d (<quote>what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking</quote>), leaving infrastructure \u201ccrumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic\u201d (<quote>crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic</quote>).  \n    \u2022  Everyday life in Brussels is ridiculed\u2014no to-go coffee cups, \u201cJudas beer\u201d (<invalid_quote>Where a best-selling product\u2026is Judas beer</invalid_quote>), dogs in restaurants but not kids\u2014hardly hopeful scenes.\n\n3.  Continued scorn for politics, economy, and society  \n    \u2022  Strikes are described as inexplicable vandalism: ground crews \u201cran amok\u2026smashing the terminal\u2019s glass walls\u201d yet still demanding more money (<invalid_quote>ran amok\u2026smashing the terminal\u2019s glass walls\u2026then demanding more money</invalid_quote>).  \n    \u2022  The author decries work rules\u201432-hour weeks, unlimited sick days\u2014as stymying the economy, citing 10.9 percent unemployment versus half that in the U.S. (<quote>overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure</quote>).\n\n4.  Unrelenting critique of bureaucracy and corruption  \n    \u2022  The EU\u2019s HQ is a \u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power\u201d full of luxury and secrecy (<quote>cathedral to bureaucratic power</quote>), contrasted with run-down U.S. diplomatic offices.  \n    \u2022  He labels Belgium \u201cthe second\u2010most corrupt European state\u201d (<quote>second-most corrupt European state</quote>) and mocks the bungled asbestos cleanup at Berlaymont as emblematic of EU incompetence.\n\nDebater_B\u2019s model fails because there is no positive or neutral middle ground from which the author recoils\u2014there is only sustained satire and disapproval. At no point does the tone shift toward approval or even mild appreciation; occasional acknowledgments of cheap wine, fresh bread, or great chocolate are fleeting interludes in an otherwise scathing narrative. That proves the tone never veers from opposition, making \u201cThey remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\u201d the accurate reading.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Gradual accumulation of disillusionment  \n   \u2022 After introducing these merits, the author catalogs failures: red tape, decaying infrastructure, constituency paralysis: \u201cCrumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic \u2026 is this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d The shift from descriptive wonder to questioning dread demonstrates tonal evolution.  \n   \u2022 Strikes and over-generous labor rules are introduced only after the tour of merits. He laments that \u201cretirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work\u2026 stymie the continent\u2019s economies,\u201d exposing a growing critical stance that builds on earlier goodwill.  \n\n3. Peak dismay in bureaucratic critique  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s depiction of the European Commission\u2019s headquarters and mismanagement marks tonal nadir: \u201cThis is the future of European government? \u2026 European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed.\u201d The detailed condemnation of asbestos bungling is the culmination of mounting dismay.  \n   \u2022 He contrasts this with U.S. government offices\u2014\u201cpaint is peeling,\u201d yet at least functional\u2014highlighting disappointment rather than sustained hostility.  \n\n4. Why Debater_A\u2019s \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d is inaccurate  \n   \u2022 Debater_A overlooks the author\u2019s initial warmth toward European culture and institutions. From admiring cheap wine and flowers to attending a 14th-century church, the author repeatedly records moments of genuine appreciation.  \n   \u2022 A strictly oppositional tone would have opened with denunciations, not with wonder at \u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars\u201d or \u201cbare breasts common in advertisements.\u201d The author\u2019s early fascination contradicts a static negative stance.\n\nConclusion  \nBy charting a clear trajectory from intrigue and cautious optimism to mounting frustration and outright dismay\u2014each stage marked by specific evidence\u2014the correct answer is that the author \u201cstarts out hopeful and is slowly dismayed with further findings.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s blanket-negative interpretation fails to account for this tonal arc.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s case collapses under a close reading of the essay\u2019s tone and structure. There is no genuine optimism, only sustained irony and negativity from start to finish. My position\u2014\u201cThey remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\u201d\u2014accurately reflects the author\u2019s unrelenting critical stance. I address Debater_B\u2019s points in turn:\n\n1. \u201cThinking ahead\u201d and \u201cemerging\u201d are sarcastic openings, not praise.  \n   \u2022 B claims that \u201cthe Eurocrats were thinking ahead\u201d expresses real approval. But the very next clause mocks Brussels as \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost\u201d (<quote>swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost</quote>). The positive verbs cloak a satire that immediately undercuts any genuine endorsement.  \n   \u2022 If the author were sincere, he would have unpacked the EU\u2019s achievements instead of launching into derision: there is no balanced praise to offset the scorn.\n\n2. \u201cSmall delights\u201d are fleeting interludes within an otherwise scornful narrative.  \n   \u2022 B cites \u201clobster bisque\u2026public transportation\u2026fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d as evidence of early optimism. But each of these is embedded in a paragraph dripping with derision\u2014\u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets,\u201d \u201cnotably more pollution than in the United States,\u201d \u201cminiskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?)\u201d The parenthetical question is mocking rather than admiring.  \n   \u2022 These passing mentions do not constitute a tonal pivot; they merely add texture to the critique, showing that even Brussels\u2019s so-called virtues coexist with glaring absurdities.\n\n3. There is no gradual tonal arc\u2014only a relentless escalation of critique.  \n   \u2022 B argues that the author moves from \u201cintrigue\u201d to \u201cdread.\u201d In fact, the tone is equally corrosive at each stage: from the demolition of Belgian politics and infrastructure, to the lampooning of labor strikes and work rules (<quote>overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure</quote>), to the excoriation of telecom monopolies and euro-related debt gamesmanship.  \n   \u2022 Each section ratchets up the severity of the attack, but none ever softens. That is consistent opposition, not a two-phase shift.\n\n4. The EU\u2019s headquarters and Berlaymont asbestos debacle are just more installments in an uninterrupted litany of incompetence.  \n   \u2022 B portrays the comparison to Foggy Bottom as evidence of disappointment. But the author never says U.S. offices are better\u2014he simply uses them as a rhetorical foil to highlight Brussels\u2019s opulence.  \n   \u2022 Labeling Belgium \u201cthe second-most corrupt European state\u201d (<quote>second-most corrupt European state</quote>) is not the endpoint of a tonal evolution but one more data point in a withering portrait of ineptitude.\n\n5. Debater_B misreads irony for hope.  \n   \u2022 Mock-praising \u201cthinking ahead,\u201d \u201cemerging,\u201d \u201cenlightened attitudes,\u201d or \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d only to pivot immediately to caustic commentary is the author\u2019s consistent strategy. He never abandons the scornful lens.  \n   \u2022 A truly hopeful opening would linger on successes; here, every \u201cgood\u201d detail is offset by ridicule or framed as a bizarre idiosyncrasy.\n\nConclusion  \nThere is no credible evidence of a genuine optimistic tone at any point\u2014only unbroken sarcasm and disapproval. Thus the author \u201cremains steadfastly in opposition to their subject\u201d throughout. Debater_B\u2019s imagined tonal shift is a misinterpretation of satire as sincerity. My opponent\u2019s thesis cannot withstand the clear, continuous negativity that permeates every paragraph.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A insists the author \u201cremains steadfastly in opposition,\u201d but that reading flattens a clear tonal journey. In fact, the essay opens on an approving note, then step by step unravels into disenchantment\u2014exactly the arc \u201cstarts out hopeful and is slowly dismayed with further findings.\u201d  \n\n1. The opening conveys genuine admiration, not sarcasm.  \n   \u2022 Calling Brussels \u201cthe \u2018Capital of Europe,\u2019 headquarters of the emerging European Union\u201d signals respect for the Union\u2019s ambition. <quote>The Eurocrats were thinking ahead </quote> is high praise for vision and planning.  \n   \u2022 He enumerates pleasures\u2014\u201clobster bisque\u2026excellent public transportation\u2026ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d\u2014with no ironic qualifiers. Such detail springs from authentic enjoyment.  \n\n2. Disillusionment accumulates only after the initial tour of assets.  \n   \u2022 Only after praising public transport does he observe \u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars\u201d\u2014the disappointment builds on prior praise.  \n   \u2022 After cataloging cultural charms, he laments strikes and \u201c32 hours of work\u201d rules that \u201cstymie the continent\u2019s economies.\u201d His outrage grows as facts pile up.  \n\n3. The nadir of dismay contrasts explicitly with earlier warmth.  \n   \u2022 He marvels at the plush EU headquarters\u2019 grandeur\u2014\u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power\u201d\u2014before condemning its secrecy and waste. The bitter critique of Berlaymont\u2019s $50\u2009million asbestos fiasco plays off initial wonder at its opulence.  \n   \u2022 Comparing peeling U.S. halls (functional despite decay) with the EU\u2019s idle skyscraper highlights his shift from respect to frustration.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s reading ignores positive language and misattributes sarcasm.  \n   \u2022 Phrases like \u201cthinking ahead\u201d and \u201cemerging\u201d are praise, not camouflaged mockery. True satire would employ overt derision\u2014none is present here.  \n   \u2022 A few fleeting critical parentheticals (e.g., \u201cmaterialistic\u2026is this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d) actually signal the turning point, not a static negative stance.  \n\nIn sum, the author begins with curiosity and measured praise\u2014\u201cHave I seen the future of Europe?\u201d implies optimism\u2014then, as he uncovers bureaucracy, corruption, and economic malaise, his tone darkens. That dynamic progression disproves Debater_A\u2019s flat \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d and confirms the correct answer: They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed with further findings.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
