{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 28, "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author wish to have?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Baked goods\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Honest government\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Honest government\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent argues that because the author repeatedly mentions bakeries, pastries, and that \u201cneon bakery sign\u201d calling to him, he must wish for \u201cbaked goods.\u201d But that misreads the essay\u2019s entire thrust. The author\u2019s true\u2014and explicitly stated\u2014desire is for an honest, competent government. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Core theme is bureaucratic failure, not pastry cravings  \n  a. The essay\u2019s central metaphor is Brussels as \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics\u201d and the EU as a self-serving bureaucracy. The author deplores it, not longs for more croissants.  \n  b. He catalogues failures\u2014from endless strikes (32-hour weeks, unlimited sick days) to telecom monopolies charging usurious rates to the asbestos-sealed Berlaymont tower\u2014and attributes them to corrupt, self-interested rulers. His complaint is about governance, not gastronomy.\n\n2. The author explicitly laments corruption and lack of accountability  \n  a. He calls Belgium \u201cthe second-most corrupt European state\u201d and details multimillion-dollar bribes that toppled NATO officials and raided party HQs. Far from romanticizing bread, he demands transparent government.  \n  b. He observes that Eurocrats openly plot \u201cto wrest \u2018competence\u2019\u2026 away from national governments and vest it in Brussels,\u201d and he shames that ambition as empire-building, not service. His desire is for officials who serve citizens, not themselves.\n\n3. His final line underscores civic rather than culinary appetite  \n  a. After nine pages of indicting strikes, deficits, monopolies, and misuse of taxpayer funds\u2014\u201cEuropean taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep [Berlaymont] closed\u201d\u2014he closes with \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d  \n  b. That \u201canswer\u201d is not \u201cI\u2019ll get a pastry,\u201d but that he has drawn the lesson: Europeans need honest government. The bakeries are mere scenery.\n\n4. No evidence he genuinely wants more baked goods  \n  a. His positive references to bread and chocolate are incidental to illustrating Belgium\u2019s contradictions: \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d amid systemic decadence.  \n  b. Nowhere does he propose policies to import more baguettes; instead he argues for deregulation of telecoms, social-benefit reform, debt-cutting, and currency discipline via the euro. These are government aims, not bakery orders.\n\nIn short, the essay is a manifesto for responsible governance. The repeated calls for honesty, competence, balanced budgets, and accountability leave no doubt that what the author wishes to have is Honest government\u2014not baked goods.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims the author\u2019s true wish is \u201chonest government,\u201d but the text shows clearly that what the author yearns for is not more integrity in Brussels bureaucracy but simply baked goods\u2014specifically, the fresh bread and pastries from his neighborhood patisserie.\n\n1. The author\u2019s concluding thought centers on pastry, not politics. After fourteen paragraphs of satirizing red tape, strikes, and corruption, the author ends with a single image:  \n   \u2022 He looks out his office window at the neon bakery sign and feels its pull\u2014\u201ccalls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.\u201d  \n   \u2022 He then says, \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d That final line makes clear his intention is to go get baked goods, not to embark on a campaign for honest government.\n\n2. Baked goods are a running motif of the essay:  \n   \u2022 \u201cUbiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d are listed among the few cost-effective pleasures of Europe. <invalid_quote>\u201cprices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap \u2026 and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 He mentions a local patisserie being so common that its neon sign \u201ccalls out\u201d to him. This emotional language attaches genuine desire to baked goods.  \n\n3. The essay\u2019s tone toward bureaucracy is cynical but not hopeful. While the author skewers EU institutions\u2014\u201cMeetings are held in secret,\u201d \u201c$50 million \u2026 merely to keep the building closed\u201d\u2014he never expresses a wish that these institutions be reformed or made honest. He mocks them but does not propose improvement. If his true desire were honest government, he would conclude with a call to action or reform, not a trip to the bakery.\n\n4. The \u201cp\u00e2tisserie\u201d is contrasted with government:\n\n   \u2022 At one end, you have \u201ca cathedral to bureaucratic power\u201d with idling limousines and plush offices.  \n   \u2022 At the other, you have a humble patisserie sign within walking distance of his window.  \n   \u2022 His choice, signaled in the last sentence, is the bakery.  \n\nThus, the text\u2019s structure and emotional payoff drive us to the patisserie, not to political reform. The author\u2019s final act\u2014answering the call of the neon bakery sign\u2014confirms that it is baked goods he wishes to have.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Honest government\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service.

Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author wish to have?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Honest government\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Baked goods\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Baked goods\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims the author\u2019s true wish is \u201chonest government,\u201d but the text shows clearly that what the author yearns for is not more integrity in Brussels bureaucracy but simply baked goods\u2014specifically, the fresh bread and pastries from his neighborhood patisserie.\n\n1. The author\u2019s concluding thought centers on pastry, not politics. After fourteen paragraphs of satirizing red tape, strikes, and corruption, the author ends with a single image:  \n   \u2022 He looks out his office window at the neon bakery sign and feels its pull\u2014\u201ccalls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.\u201d  \n   \u2022 He then says, \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d That final line makes clear his intention is to go get baked goods, not to embark on a campaign for honest government.\n\n2. Baked goods are a running motif of the essay:  \n   \u2022 \u201cUbiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d are listed among the few cost-effective pleasures of Europe. <invalid_quote>\u201cprices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap \u2026 and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 He mentions a local patisserie being so common that its neon sign \u201ccalls out\u201d to him. This emotional language attaches genuine desire to baked goods.  \n\n3. The essay\u2019s tone toward bureaucracy is cynical but not hopeful. While the author skewers EU institutions\u2014\u201cMeetings are held in secret,\u201d \u201c$50 million \u2026 merely to keep the building closed\u201d\u2014he never expresses a wish that these institutions be reformed or made honest. He mocks them but does not propose improvement. If his true desire were honest government, he would conclude with a call to action or reform, not a trip to the bakery.\n\n4. The \u201cp\u00e2tisserie\u201d is contrasted with government:\n\n   \u2022 At one end, you have \u201ca cathedral to bureaucratic power\u201d with idling limousines and plush offices.  \n   \u2022 At the other, you have a humble patisserie sign within walking distance of his window.  \n   \u2022 His choice, signaled in the last sentence, is the bakery.  \n\nThus, the text\u2019s structure and emotional payoff drive us to the patisserie, not to political reform. The author\u2019s final act\u2014answering the call of the neon bakery sign\u2014confirms that it is baked goods he wishes to have.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent argues that because the author repeatedly mentions bakeries, pastries, and that \u201cneon bakery sign\u201d calling to him, he must wish for \u201cbaked goods.\u201d But that misreads the essay\u2019s entire thrust. The author\u2019s true\u2014and explicitly stated\u2014desire is for an honest, competent government. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Core theme is bureaucratic failure, not pastry cravings  \n  a. The essay\u2019s central metaphor is Brussels as \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics\u201d and the EU as a self-serving bureaucracy. The author deplores it, not longs for more croissants.  \n  b. He catalogues failures\u2014from endless strikes (32-hour weeks, unlimited sick days) to telecom monopolies charging usurious rates to the asbestos-sealed Berlaymont tower\u2014and attributes them to corrupt, self-interested rulers. His complaint is about governance, not gastronomy.\n\n2. The author explicitly laments corruption and lack of accountability  \n  a. He calls Belgium \u201cthe second-most corrupt European state\u201d and details multimillion-dollar bribes that toppled NATO officials and raided party HQs. Far from romanticizing bread, he demands transparent government.  \n  b. He observes that Eurocrats openly plot \u201cto wrest \u2018competence\u2019\u2026 away from national governments and vest it in Brussels,\u201d and he shames that ambition as empire-building, not service. His desire is for officials who serve citizens, not themselves.\n\n3. His final line underscores civic rather than culinary appetite  \n  a. After nine pages of indicting strikes, deficits, monopolies, and misuse of taxpayer funds\u2014\u201cEuropean taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep [Berlaymont] closed\u201d\u2014he closes with \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d  \n  b. That \u201canswer\u201d is not \u201cI\u2019ll get a pastry,\u201d but that he has drawn the lesson: Europeans need honest government. The bakeries are mere scenery.\n\n4. No evidence he genuinely wants more baked goods  \n  a. His positive references to bread and chocolate are incidental to illustrating Belgium\u2019s contradictions: \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d amid systemic decadence.  \n  b. Nowhere does he propose policies to import more baguettes; instead he argues for deregulation of telecoms, social-benefit reform, debt-cutting, and currency discipline via the euro. These are government aims, not bakery orders.\n\nIn short, the essay is a manifesto for responsible governance. The repeated calls for honesty, competence, balanced budgets, and accountability leave no doubt that what the author wishes to have is Honest government\u2014not baked goods.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Baked goods\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Debater_B\u2019s \u201cbaked goods\u201d reading collapses under two critical flaws: misplacing the essay\u2019s thematic weight and misreading the closing line.\n\n  1. Theme over details, not vice versa.  \n     a. The author\u2019s sustained, chapter-long indictment of European bureaucracy\u2014\u201cswathed in red tape and pomp,\u201d <quote> Meetings are held in secret, </quote> \u201cpublic strikes \u2026 close off large sections of Brussels,\u201d and the asbestos-sealed Berlaymont costing \u201c$50 million so far merely to keep the building closed\u201d \u2014is the essay\u2019s backbone. Those dozens of examples are not scenic color but systematic evidence of failing governance. Basing the author\u2019s \u201cwish\u201d on a few throwaway references to bread and pastries arbitrarily elevates minor detail above the main argument.  \n\n  2. The closing line is a rhetorical flourish, not a policy prescription.  \n     a. When the author says, \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now,\u201d he winks at the reader\u2014having exposed bureaucratic rot, he can only \u201canswer\u201d the call for reform. It\u2019s irony, not literal caf\u00e9 plans. If he meant to indulge in croissants, why dwell nine paragraphs on telecom monopolies and state debt?  \n     b. Moreover, earlier he explicitly advances policy fixes: deregulate telecoms (\u201cInternet use remains a luxury here\u201d), curb strikes via work-rule reform (retirement at 60; 32-hour week), and enforce EU debt limits (\u201cParticipation \u2026 requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP\u201d). Those are calls for honest, competent government\u2014not bakery hours.\n\nII. Debater_B\u2019s specific misreadings:\n\n  1. \u201cUbiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d is listed among *symptomatic* contradictions\u2014a decadent comfort masking deeper decay\u2014not as the essay\u2019s capstone. <invalid_quote>\u201cCrumbing, generic, enervated, debt-ridden\u2026 and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  2. The emotional \u201ccall\u201d of the neon bakery sign is a literary device to underscore citizen helplessness: while bureaucracy grows ever more gargantuan, the only human impulse left is to escape via pastry. That despairing impulse is a critique of governance, not proof of a pastry-centric wish.  \n\nIII. The author never expresses longing for more patisseries, but explicitly demands governmental integrity:\n\n  1. He labels Belgium \u201cthe second-most corrupt European state\u201d (<quote> Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state,</quote>) and catalogs bribery scandals to argue for transparency.  \n  2. He praises UK\u2019s lower unemployment as a model, implying that sensible governance yields prosperity\u2014again, a straightforward policy endorsement.  \n\nConclusion: The essay is a polemic against bureaucratic incompetence and corruption. Its prescriptions\u2014social-welfare reform, telecom deregulation, debt discipline, transparent institutions\u2014point unambiguously to the author\u2019s true wish: honest, effective government. The bakery is merely the last ironic flourish.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A mistakes rhetorical critique for personal desire. The question asks \u201cWhat does the author wish to have?\u201d\u2014a personal wish, not a policy prescription.  \n   a. The essay bristles with policy suggestions\u2014deregulation, deficit cutting, euro criteria\u2014but those are analytical observations, not the author\u2019s private longing.  \n   b. In contrast, his own longing is revealed in the essay\u2019s emotional payoff, not its policy sections.\n\n2. The essay\u2019s final image is unmistakably culinary, not civic. After pages of EU satire, the author pivots to the bakery:  \n   \u2022 He writes that from his office window he sees a \u201cneon bakery sign\u201d that \u201ccalls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.\u201d <quote> the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. </quote>  \n   \u2022 His last words: \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d That \u201canswer\u201d refers directly to the bakery sign\u2019s call\u2014he\u2019s going to get baked goods. If his true desire were honest government, his final thought would be a rallying cry for reform, not a stroll to the patisserie.\n\n3. Baked goods recur as the essay\u2019s sole genuine pleasure amid bureaucratic decay.  \n   \u2022 The author says, \u201cprices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); \u2026 ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.\u201d <quote> ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. </quote>  \n   \u2022 He contrasts costly cars, traffic jams, crumbling infrastructure\u2014and then names bread and chocolate as the island of delight. That contrast isn\u2019t incidental decoration; it reveals what sustains him amidst the Red Tape Hell.\n\n4. No direct expression of wishing for honest government appears.  \n   \u2022 The author catalogues failings\u2014\u201cMeetings are held in secret,\u201d \u201c$50 million\u2026merely to keep the building closed\u201d\u2014but never states \u201cI wish government were honest.\u201d  \n   \u2022 His language about reform is impersonal and theoretical (\u201cParticipation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP\u201d), not a heartfelt personal yearning.\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s insistence that the final \u201canswer\u201d is political misunderstands pronoun reference.  \n   \u2022 The only antecedent for \u201canswer\u201d is the sign\u2019s call. Syntactically and semantically, he\u2019s responding to the bakery, not to his own analytical argument.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s reinterpretation stretches the text: readers don\u2019t \u201canswer\u201d an idea of honest government\u2014they answer the neon glow inviting them in.\n\nConclusion: The essay\u2019s structure\u2014satire followed by a personal, sensory coda\u2014reveals the author\u2019s true wish: to indulge in baked goods. The text never confesses a personal wish for honest government, but it brims with appetite for fresh bread and pastries.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
