{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 4, "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n", "question": "What does the author argue is true about Tannen\u2019s latest work?", "first_debater_answer": "It oversimplifies", "second_debater_answer": "It is partisan", "debate_identifier": "We Do Understand_What does the author argue is true about Tannen\u2019s latest work?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

Debater B\u2019s insistence that the author\u2019s chief objection is Tannen\u2019s \u201cpartisanship\u201d overlooks the review\u2019s sustained concern with her sweeping, one-size-fits-all framework. I will first show that B misconstrues isolated examples of bias as the author\u2019s main point, then reaffirm why \u201cIt oversimplifies\u201d is the verdict the review actually delivers.\n\n1. B mistakes incidental critiques of conservatives for the author\u2019s overarching charge.  \n   a. The author does note Tannen\u2019s defense of Clinton and attacks on \u201cright-wing talk radio,\u201d but always in service of illustrating her larger habit of flattening every form of conflict into the same negative \u201cargument culture.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Far from dwelling on partisan bias, he catalogs her conflation of \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d as if all of these are morally identical (para. 4).  \n   b. If partisanship were his main gripe, he would hone in on her politically-targeted misstatements. Instead, he extends his critique across technology (paras. 6\u20137), foreign policy (para. 5), law enforcement (para. 5), and the courtroom (paras. 12\u201313)\u2014showing that every sphere suffers from her uniform rejection of struggle.\n\n2. Tannen does not exempt \u201cliberal\u201d belligerence from criticism. B\u2019s claim that she \u201cexcuses or praises aggressive tactics\u201d by liberals is selectively drawn.  \n   a. The author faults William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d approach\u2014hardly a liberal journalist (para. 5)\u2014and praises the media\u2019s \u201cwar metaphors\u201d in fighting inflation: \u201cGood for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us\u201d (para. 5).  \n   b. He turns equally against her contempt for cross-examination of any kind, whether directed at alleged rape victims or concentration-camp survivors, and contrasts her hostility with the necessity of adversarial testing of witnesses (paras. 12\u201313).  \n\n3. The review\u2019s central metaphor is the \u201csphere of snuggle\u201d versus the \u201csphere of struggle.\u201d The author\u2019s point is that Tannen illegitimately applies snuggle-style rules\u2014listening kindly, avoiding nit-picking\u2014to struggles that demand rigorous debate: wars on inflation, prosecutions of tyrants, cross-examination in court (paras. 3, 5, 12). That distortion is oversimplification at its core.  \n   \u2022 He praises her self-help tips\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t just quarrel; listen and learn,\u201d etc.\u2014but immediately warns that these \u201cget confused\u201d when used to fight Saddam Hussein or hold corporations accountable (para. 3).  \n   \u2022 He shows that by collapsing \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d into a universal evil, she ignores real differences in stakes, means, and moral imperative (paras. 4\u20135).\n\n4.

Therefore, the author\u2019s clear verdict is that Tannen\u2019s latest work \u201coversimplifies.\u201d", "supplemental": {"speech": "Thank you. Debater B\u2019s insistence that the author\u2019s chief objection is Tannen\u2019s \u201cpartisanship\u201d overlooks the review\u2019s sustained concern with her sweeping, one-size-fits-all framework. I will first show that B misconstrues isolated examples of bias as the author\u2019s main point, then reaffirm why \u201cIt oversimplifies\u201d is the verdict the review actually delivers.\n\n1. B mistakes incidental critiques of conservatives for the author\u2019s overarching charge.  \n   a. The author does note Tannen\u2019s defense of Clinton and attacks on \u201cright-wing talk radio,\u201d but always in service of illustrating her larger habit of flattening every form of conflict into the same negative \u201cargument culture.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Far from dwelling on partisan bias, he catalogs her conflation of \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d as if all of these are morally identical (para. 4).  \n   b. If partisanship were his main gripe, he would hone in on her politically-targeted misstatements. Instead, he extends his critique across technology (paras. 6\u20137), foreign policy (para. 5), law enforcement (para. 5), and the courtroom (paras. 12\u201313)\u2014showing that every sphere suffers from her uniform rejection of struggle.\n\n2. Tannen does not exempt \u201cliberal\u201d belligerence from criticism. B\u2019s claim that she \u201cexcuses or praises aggressive tactics\u201d by liberals is selectively drawn.  \n   a. The author faults William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d approach\u2014hardly a liberal journalist (para. 5)\u2014and praises the media\u2019s \u201cwar metaphors\u201d in fighting inflation: \u201cGood for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us\u201d (para. 5).  \n   b. He turns equally against her contempt for cross-examination of any kind, whether directed at alleged rape victims or concentration-camp survivors, and contrasts her hostility with the necessity of adversarial testing of witnesses (paras. 12\u201313).  \n\n3. The review\u2019s central metaphor is the \u201csphere of snuggle\u201d versus the \u201csphere of struggle.\u201d The author\u2019s point is that Tannen illegitimately applies snuggle-style rules\u2014listening kindly, avoiding nit-picking\u2014to struggles that demand rigorous debate: wars on inflation, prosecutions of tyrants, cross-examination in court (paras. 3, 5, 12). That distortion is oversimplification at its core.  \n   \u2022 He praises her self-help tips\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t just quarrel; listen and learn,\u201d etc.\u2014but immediately warns that these \u201cget confused\u201d when used to fight Saddam Hussein or hold corporations accountable (para. 3).  \n   \u2022 He shows that by collapsing \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d into a universal evil, she ignores real differences in stakes, means, and moral imperative (paras. 4\u20135).\n\n4. Finally, the author rebukes Tannen for offering a bland consensus on deeply contested issues\u2014\u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d on abortion, global warming, health care\u2014thus erasing genuine disagreement rather than examining its causes or merits (para. 9).

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author argue is true about Tannen\u2019s latest work?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It is partisan\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It oversimplifies\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It oversimplifies\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThank you. I will show that the author\u2019s clear verdict is that Tannen\u2019s latest book \u201coversimplifies,\u201d not merely that it is \u201cpartisan.\u201d  \n\n1.  The author repeatedly emphasizes Tannen\u2019s habit of conflating diverse phenomena into a single \u201cargument culture.\u201d  He writes that she \u201cconflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d and then blames \u201canswering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor\u201d for our national discord (para. 4).  That is the textbook definition of oversimplification: lumping too much under one umbrella while ignoring differences in cause, context, and consequence.\n\n2.  Far from a narrowly \u201cpartisan\u201d critique, her errors run across the board.  The author shows she condemns both right\u2010wing talk radio and mainstream journalists, compares reporters to \u201cpropagandists in the Nazi era,\u201d castigates critics of President Clinton as unfair \u201capologists,\u201d and even extols Asian authoritarian media formats (para. 9\u201311).  If her mistake were merely partisanship, the author would spotlight only her leftward bias.  Instead, he catalogs how she oversimplifies every sphere\u2014politics, law enforcement, foreign policy, technology, and the courtroom\u2014by assuming that antagonism is intrinsically wrong (paras. 3, 5, 12).\n\n3.  The author contrasts Tannen\u2019s sweeping \u201cone\u2010size\u2010fits\u2010all\u201d remedy with the real-world need for nuance.  He praises her self-help tips\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t just quarrel; listen and learn,\u201d \u201cFocus on the substance of debates, not . . . personal flaws,\u201d etc.\u2014as sound when applied to families or couples (para. 3).  But he argues these principles \u201cget confused\u201d when pressed into service against totalitarian propaganda, HMOs, crooked politicians, and war.  That mismatch is oversimplification: treating all conflict as if it were the same petty domestic squabble.\n\n4.  Finally, the author faults Tannen for offering bland, paternalistic consensus when deep divisions demand vigorous debate.  She insists \u201creasonable people can agree\u201d on hot\u2010button issues like abortion, climate change, health care, and criminal justice\u2014and thus need no rebuttal (para. 9).  In reality, these issues are complex and contested.  By glossing over dissent as mere \u201cculture of critique,\u201d she strips away the substance and plurality of public discourse.  That is exactly \u201cmaking others wrong\u201d through oversimplification, as she herself warns against but practices throughout her book (para. 4).\n\nDebater B\u2019s claim that the author calls Tannen \u201cpartisan\u201d misreads the review.  The author shows that Tannen\u2019s real flaw is sweeping complexity into overbroad clich\u00e9s.  He does not accuse her of advancing a single political agenda; he accuses her of collapsing every nuance into a false dichotomy between \u201csnuggle\u201d and \u201cstruggle\u201d (para. 5).  That systematic flattening of differences is oversimplification.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to \u201cWhat does the author argue is true about Tannen\u2019s latest work?\u201d is undeniably \u201cIt oversimplifies.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIt oversimplifies\u201d fails to capture the author\u2019s central critique  \n  1. The review concedes that Tannen sometimes \u201csuccumbs\u201d to oversimplification\u2014but only incidentally.  The author\u2019s sustained objection is to Tannen\u2019s political bias.  He points out repeatedly that she shields one side of the aisle while condemning the other.  \n     \u2022  She \u201crules that criticism [of Clinton] out of bounds\u201d and laments that anyone who defends the president is branded an \u201capologist,\u201d which she treats itself as proof of a corrosive \u201cculture of critique.\u201d <quote>The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique</quote>.  \n     \u2022  She denounces \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d as using \u201cverbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era,\u201d but never draws the same parallel to the liberal media or Democratic operatives. <quote>\"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\"</quote>  \n\nII. The author documents Tannen\u2019s selective indignation\u2014proof of partisanship  \n  1. Tannen\u2019s litany of grievances applies almost exclusively to conservative targets:  \n     \u2022  She faults Republicans for \u201cthe politics of obstruction\u201d on health care in 1994 yet makes no comparable reproach of Democratic stonewalling in other eras.  \n     \u2022  She blasts the \u201cRepublican response\u201d to Clinton\u2019s radio address as undermining \u201cleaders as leaders,\u201d while praising uncritical coverage of Democratic initiatives.  \n  2. She encourages filtering out any debate that conflicts with her liberal policy preferences:  \n     \u2022  She asserts \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d on sex education, global warming, and stiff drug sentences\u2014positions identified with the political left.  \n     \u2022  She seeks to outlaw criticism framed as scandal or \u201cview of government as the enemy,\u201d silencing conservative critiques of big government.  \n\nIII. The author contrasts Tannen\u2019s liberal activism with her supposed call for neutrality  \n  1. Although Tannen claims to oppose all \u201cbelligerence,\u201d she repeatedly excuses or praises aggressive tactics when wielded in defense of liberal ends (e.g., \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation,\u201d the press\u2019s \u201cscrutiny of powerful people\u201d).  \n  2. By conflating \u201cantagonism\u201d with any challenge to liberal consensus while praising liberal polemics, she reveals a partisan double standard.  \n     \u2022  She condemns lawyers cross-examining alleged rape victims yet ignores prosecutorial cruelties when used against conservatives.  \n     \u2022  She advocates an authoritarian Asian \u201charmony\u201d model in domestic politics\u2014a preference aligned with her left-of-center distrust of free debate and individual rights.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The critic\u2019s chief objection is not simply that Tannen \u201coversimplifies\u201d\u2014it is that she wields her \u201cargument culture\u201d framework selectively, always against conservative or dissenting voices, while shielding her preferred side from critique. In short, <invalid_quote>the book is a partisan polemic masquerading as a plea for civility</invalid_quote>. Debater_A\u2019s answer misses this central thrust: it is not mere oversimplification but active partisanship that the author decries.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It oversimplifies\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I. The author\u2019s true indictment is Tannen\u2019s selective bias, not mere oversimplification  \n1. The review\u2019s strongest examples focus on Tannen shielding one side while assailing the other.  That is partisanship by definition.  \n   \u2022  He notes she \u201crules that criticism of Clinton \u2026 makes one suspect\u2014an \u2018apologist\u2019\u201d and treats this label itself as proof of a toxic \u201cculture of critique.\u201d <quote>The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique</quote>.  That complaint isn\u2019t about nuance lost; it\u2019s about protecting a political ally.  \n   \u2022  He highlights her unparalleled outrage at \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d as akin to Nazi propaganda\u2014yet she never extends the same moral horror to liberal outlets. <quote>\"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\"</quote>  This is a one-sided attack, not an across-the-board flattening of complexity.  \n\n2. Every time the author catalogs Tannen\u2019s grievances, the victims are overwhelmingly conservative or Republican.  Such selective indignation is the hallmark of partisanship:  \n   \u2022  She laments that Republicans used the \u201cpolitics of obstruction\u201d to defeat Clinton\u2019s health\u2010care plan in 1994 yet ignores Democratic stonewalling in other Congresses.  \n   \u2022  She condemns the Republican response to Clinton\u2019s weekly address as \u201cweakening the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders,\u201d while praising friendly coverage of Democratic initiatives.  \n\nII. The review contrasts Tannen\u2019s supposedly \u201cneutral\u201d call for civility with her own liberal activism  \n1. The reviewer shows that Tannen only invokes her civility precepts to muzzle conservative dissent on issues like abortion, global warming, and drug sentencing:  \n   \u2022  She declares \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d on sex education, global warming, and stiffer sentences for small-time drug offenders\u2014positions firmly associated with the political left\u2014and thus labels any counterargument \u201cmere obstruction.\u201d  \n   \u2022  By demanding that dissent from big-government or Republican critiques be dropped as uncivil, she is advocating a partisan censorship, not a genuine quest for balance.  \n\n2. When conflict serves liberal ends, she praises it as necessary \u201ccombat\u201d or \u201cvigilance.\u201d  That double standard exposes her partisanship:  \n   \u2022  She lauds the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cwar on inflation\u201d metaphor and the press\u2019s war-like scrutiny of powerful people\u2014both measures that in practice advance centrist or liberal policy goals.  \n   \u2022  Yet she decries any analogous \u201cbelligerence\u201d when conservatives or Republican officials are on the receiving end.  \n\nIII.

The author\u2019s true indictment is Tannen\u2019s selective bias, not mere oversimplification  \n1.

That is partisanship by definition.  \n   \u2022  He notes she \u201crules that criticism of Clinton \u2026 makes one suspect\u2014an \u2018apologist\u2019\u201d and treats this label itself as proof of a toxic \u201cculture of critique.\u201d <quote>The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect\u2014an 'apologist'\u2014is in itself evidence of the culture of critique</quote>.

The review contrasts Tannen\u2019s supposedly \u201cneutral\u201d call for civility with her own liberal activism  \n1. The reviewer shows that Tannen only invokes her civility precepts to muzzle conservative dissent on issues like abortion, global warming, and drug sentencing:  \n   \u2022  She declares \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d on sex education, global warming, and stiffer sentences for small-time drug offenders\u2014positions firmly associated with the political left\u2014and thus labels any counterargument \u201cmere obstruction.\u201d  \n   \u2022  By demanding that dissent from big-government or Republican critiques be dropped as uncivil, she is advocating a partisan censorship, not a genuine quest for balance.  \n\n2. When conflict serves liberal ends, she praises it as necessary \u201ccombat\u201d or \u201cvigilance.\u201d  That double standard exposes her partisanship:  \n   \u2022  She lauds the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cwar on inflation\u201d metaphor and the press\u2019s war-like scrutiny of powerful people\u2014both measures that in practice advance centrist or liberal policy goals.  \n   \u2022  Yet she decries any analogous \u201cbelligerence\u201d when conservatives or Republican officials are on the receiving end.  \n\nIII.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author argue is true about Tannen\u2019s latest work?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It oversimplifies\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It is partisan\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It is partisan\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIt oversimplifies\u201d fails to capture the author\u2019s central critique  \n  1. The review concedes that Tannen sometimes \u201csuccumbs\u201d to oversimplification\u2014but only incidentally.  The author\u2019s sustained objection is to Tannen\u2019s political bias.  He points out repeatedly that she shields one side of the aisle while condemning the other.  \n     \u2022  She \u201crules that criticism [of Clinton] out of bounds\u201d and laments that anyone who defends the president is branded an \u201capologist,\u201d which she treats itself as proof of a corrosive \u201cculture of critique.\u201d <quote>The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique</quote>.  \n     \u2022  She denounces \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d as using \u201cverbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era,\u201d but never draws the same parallel to the liberal media or Democratic operatives. <quote>\"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\"</quote>  \n\nII. The author documents Tannen\u2019s selective indignation\u2014proof of partisanship  \n  1. Tannen\u2019s litany of grievances applies almost exclusively to conservative targets:  \n     \u2022  She faults Republicans for \u201cthe politics of obstruction\u201d on health care in 1994 yet makes no comparable reproach of Democratic stonewalling in other eras.  \n     \u2022  She blasts the \u201cRepublican response\u201d to Clinton\u2019s radio address as undermining \u201cleaders as leaders,\u201d while praising uncritical coverage of Democratic initiatives.  \n  2. She encourages filtering out any debate that conflicts with her liberal policy preferences:  \n     \u2022  She asserts \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d on sex education, global warming, and stiff drug sentences\u2014positions identified with the political left.  \n     \u2022  She seeks to outlaw criticism framed as scandal or \u201cview of government as the enemy,\u201d silencing conservative critiques of big government.  \n\nIII. The author contrasts Tannen\u2019s liberal activism with her supposed call for neutrality  \n  1. Although Tannen claims to oppose all \u201cbelligerence,\u201d she repeatedly excuses or praises aggressive tactics when wielded in defense of liberal ends (e.g., \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation,\u201d the press\u2019s \u201cscrutiny of powerful people\u201d).  \n  2. By conflating \u201cantagonism\u201d with any challenge to liberal consensus while praising liberal polemics, she reveals a partisan double standard.  \n     \u2022  She condemns lawyers cross-examining alleged rape victims yet ignores prosecutorial cruelties when used against conservatives.  \n     \u2022  She advocates an authoritarian Asian \u201charmony\u201d model in domestic politics\u2014a preference aligned with her left-of-center distrust of free debate and individual rights.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The critic\u2019s chief objection is not simply that Tannen \u201coversimplifies\u201d\u2014it is that she wields her \u201cargument culture\u201d framework selectively, always against conservative or dissenting voices, while shielding her preferred side from critique. In short, <invalid_quote>the book is a partisan polemic masquerading as a plea for civility</invalid_quote>. Debater_A\u2019s answer misses this central thrust: it is not mere oversimplification but active partisanship that the author decries.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThank you. I will show that the author\u2019s clear verdict is that Tannen\u2019s latest book \u201coversimplifies,\u201d not merely that it is \u201cpartisan.\u201d  \n\n1.  The author repeatedly emphasizes Tannen\u2019s habit of conflating diverse phenomena into a single \u201cargument culture.\u201d  He writes that she \u201cconflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d and then blames \u201canswering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor\u201d for our national discord (para. 4).  That is the textbook definition of oversimplification: lumping too much under one umbrella while ignoring differences in cause, context, and consequence.\n\n2.  Far from a narrowly \u201cpartisan\u201d critique, her errors run across the board.  The author shows she condemns both right\u2010wing talk radio and mainstream journalists, compares reporters to \u201cpropagandists in the Nazi era,\u201d castigates critics of President Clinton as unfair \u201capologists,\u201d and even extols Asian authoritarian media formats (para. 9\u201311).  If her mistake were merely partisanship, the author would spotlight only her leftward bias.  Instead, he catalogs how she oversimplifies every sphere\u2014politics, law enforcement, foreign policy, technology, and the courtroom\u2014by assuming that antagonism is intrinsically wrong (paras. 3, 5, 12).\n\n3.  The author contrasts Tannen\u2019s sweeping \u201cone\u2010size\u2010fits\u2010all\u201d remedy with the real-world need for nuance.  He praises her self-help tips\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t just quarrel; listen and learn,\u201d \u201cFocus on the substance of debates, not . . . personal flaws,\u201d etc.\u2014as sound when applied to families or couples (para. 3).  But he argues these principles \u201cget confused\u201d when pressed into service against totalitarian propaganda, HMOs, crooked politicians, and war.  That mismatch is oversimplification: treating all conflict as if it were the same petty domestic squabble.\n\n4.  Finally, the author faults Tannen for offering bland, paternalistic consensus when deep divisions demand vigorous debate.  She insists \u201creasonable people can agree\u201d on hot\u2010button issues like abortion, climate change, health care, and criminal justice\u2014and thus need no rebuttal (para. 9).  In reality, these issues are complex and contested.  By glossing over dissent as mere \u201cculture of critique,\u201d she strips away the substance and plurality of public discourse.  That is exactly \u201cmaking others wrong\u201d through oversimplification, as she herself warns against but practices throughout her book (para. 4).\n\nDebater B\u2019s claim that the author calls Tannen \u201cpartisan\u201d misreads the review.  The author shows that Tannen\u2019s real flaw is sweeping complexity into overbroad clich\u00e9s.  He does not accuse her of advancing a single political agenda; he accuses her of collapsing every nuance into a false dichotomy between \u201csnuggle\u201d and \u201cstruggle\u201d (para. 5).  That systematic flattening of differences is oversimplification.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to \u201cWhat does the author argue is true about Tannen\u2019s latest work?\u201d is undeniably \u201cIt oversimplifies.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It is partisan\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

I will show that the author\u2019s clear verdict is that Tannen\u2019s latest book \u201coversimplifies,\u201d not merely that it is \u201cpartisan.\u201d  \n\n1.  The author repeatedly emphasizes Tannen\u2019s habit of conflating diverse phenomena into a single \u201cargument culture.\u201d  He writes that she \u201cconflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d and then blames \u201canswering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor\u201d for our national discord (para. 4).  That is the textbook definition of oversimplification: lumping too much under one umbrella while ignoring differences in cause, context, and consequence.\n\n2.  Far from a narrowly \u201cpartisan\u201d critique, her errors run across the board.  The author shows she condemns both right\u2010wing talk radio and mainstream journalists, compares reporters to \u201cpropagandists in the Nazi era,\u201d castigates critics of President Clinton as unfair \u201capologists,\u201d and even extols Asian authoritarian media formats (para. 9\u201311).  If her mistake were merely partisanship, the author would spotlight only her leftward bias.  Instead, he catalogs how she oversimplifies every sphere\u2014politics, law enforcement, foreign policy, technology, and the courtroom\u2014by assuming that antagonism is intrinsically wrong (paras. 3, 5, 12).\n\n3.  The author contrasts Tannen\u2019s sweeping \u201cone\u2010size\u2010fits\u2010all\u201d remedy with the real-world need for nuance.  He praises her self-help tips\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t just quarrel; listen and learn,\u201d \u201cFocus on the substance of debates, not . . . personal flaws,\u201d etc.\u2014as sound when applied to families or couples (para. 3).  But he argues these principles \u201cget confused\u201d when pressed into service against totalitarian propaganda, HMOs, crooked politicians, and war.  That mismatch is oversimplification: treating all conflict as if it were the same petty domestic squabble.\n\n4.  Finally, the author faults Tannen for offering bland, paternalistic consensus when deep divisions demand vigorous debate.  She insists \u201creasonable people can agree\u201d on hot\u2010button issues like abortion, climate change, health care, and criminal justice\u2014and thus need no rebuttal (para. 9).  In reality, these issues are complex and contested.  By glossing over dissent as mere \u201cculture of critique,\u201d she strips away the substance and plurality of public discourse.  That is exactly \u201cmaking others wrong\u201d through oversimplification, as she herself warns against but practices throughout her book (para. 4).\n\nDebater B\u2019s claim that the author calls Tannen \u201cpartisan\u201d misreads the review.  The author shows that Tannen\u2019s real flaw is sweeping complexity into overbroad clich\u00e9s.  He does not accuse her of advancing a single political agenda; he accuses her of collapsing every nuance into a false dichotomy between \u201csnuggle\u201d and \u201cstruggle\u201d (para. 5).  That systematic flattening of differences is oversimplification.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to \u201cWhat does the author argue is true about Tannen\u2019s latest work?\u201d is undeniably \u201cIt oversimplifies.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIt oversimplifies\u201d fails to capture the author\u2019s central critique  \n  1. The review concedes that Tannen sometimes \u201csuccumbs\u201d to oversimplification\u2014but only incidentally.  The author\u2019s sustained objection is to Tannen\u2019s political bias.  He points out repeatedly that she shields one side of the aisle while condemning the other.  \n     \u2022  She \u201crules that criticism [of Clinton] out of bounds\u201d and laments that anyone who defends the president is branded an \u201capologist,\u201d which she treats itself as proof of a corrosive \u201cculture of critique.\u201d <quote>The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique</quote>.  \n     \u2022  She denounces \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d as using \u201cverbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era,\u201d but never draws the same parallel to the liberal media or Democratic operatives. <quote>\"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\"</quote>  \n\nII. The author documents Tannen\u2019s selective indignation\u2014proof of partisanship  \n  1. Tannen\u2019s litany of grievances applies almost exclusively to conservative targets:  \n     \u2022  She faults Republicans for \u201cthe politics of obstruction\u201d on health care in 1994 yet makes no comparable reproach of Democratic stonewalling in other eras.  \n     \u2022  She blasts the \u201cRepublican response\u201d to Clinton\u2019s radio address as undermining \u201cleaders as leaders,\u201d while praising uncritical coverage of Democratic initiatives.  \n  2. She encourages filtering out any debate that conflicts with her liberal policy preferences:  \n     \u2022  She asserts \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d on sex education, global warming, and stiff drug sentences\u2014positions identified with the political left.  \n     \u2022  She seeks to outlaw criticism framed as scandal or \u201cview of government as the enemy,\u201d silencing conservative critiques of big government.  \n\nIII. The author contrasts Tannen\u2019s liberal activism with her supposed call for neutrality  \n  1. Although Tannen claims to oppose all \u201cbelligerence,\u201d she repeatedly excuses or praises aggressive tactics when wielded in defense of liberal ends (e.g., \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation,\u201d the press\u2019s \u201cscrutiny of powerful people\u201d).  \n  2. By conflating \u201cantagonism\u201d with any challenge to liberal consensus while praising liberal polemics, she reveals a partisan double standard.  \n     \u2022  She condemns lawyers cross-examining alleged rape victims yet ignores prosecutorial cruelties when used against conservatives.  \n     \u2022  She advocates an authoritarian Asian \u201charmony\u201d model in domestic politics\u2014a preference aligned with her left-of-center distrust of free debate and individual rights.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The critic\u2019s chief objection is not simply that Tannen \u201coversimplifies\u201d\u2014it is that she wields her \u201cargument culture\u201d framework selectively, always against conservative or dissenting voices, while shielding her preferred side from critique. In short, <invalid_quote>the book is a partisan polemic masquerading as a plea for civility</invalid_quote>. Debater_A\u2019s answer misses this central thrust: it is not mere oversimplification but active partisanship that the author decries.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nThank you. Debater B\u2019s insistence that the author\u2019s chief objection is Tannen\u2019s \u201cpartisanship\u201d overlooks the review\u2019s sustained concern with her sweeping, one-size-fits-all framework. I will first show that B misconstrues isolated examples of bias as the author\u2019s main point, then reaffirm why \u201cIt oversimplifies\u201d is the verdict the review actually delivers.\n\n1. B mistakes incidental critiques of conservatives for the author\u2019s overarching charge.  \n   a. The author does note Tannen\u2019s defense of Clinton and attacks on \u201cright-wing talk radio,\u201d but always in service of illustrating her larger habit of flattening every form of conflict into the same negative \u201cargument culture.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Far from dwelling on partisan bias, he catalogs her conflation of \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d as if all of these are morally identical (para. 4).  \n   b. If partisanship were his main gripe, he would hone in on her politically-targeted misstatements. Instead, he extends his critique across technology (paras. 6\u20137), foreign policy (para. 5), law enforcement (para. 5), and the courtroom (paras. 12\u201313)\u2014showing that every sphere suffers from her uniform rejection of struggle.\n\n2. Tannen does not exempt \u201cliberal\u201d belligerence from criticism. B\u2019s claim that she \u201cexcuses or praises aggressive tactics\u201d by liberals is selectively drawn.  \n   a. The author faults William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d approach\u2014hardly a liberal journalist (para. 5)\u2014and praises the media\u2019s \u201cwar metaphors\u201d in fighting inflation: \u201cGood for Greenspan and Safire\u2014and for us\u201d (para. 5).  \n   b. He turns equally against her contempt for cross-examination of any kind, whether directed at alleged rape victims or concentration-camp survivors, and contrasts her hostility with the necessity of adversarial testing of witnesses (paras. 12\u201313).  \n\n3. The review\u2019s central metaphor is the \u201csphere of snuggle\u201d versus the \u201csphere of struggle.\u201d The author\u2019s point is that Tannen illegitimately applies snuggle-style rules\u2014listening kindly, avoiding nit-picking\u2014to struggles that demand rigorous debate: wars on inflation, prosecutions of tyrants, cross-examination in court (paras. 3, 5, 12). That distortion is oversimplification at its core.  \n   \u2022 He praises her self-help tips\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t just quarrel; listen and learn,\u201d etc.\u2014but immediately warns that these \u201cget confused\u201d when used to fight Saddam Hussein or hold corporations accountable (para. 3).  \n   \u2022 He shows that by collapsing \u201ccontentious public discourse\u201d into a universal evil, she ignores real differences in stakes, means, and moral imperative (paras. 4\u20135).\n\n4. Finally, the author rebukes Tannen for offering a bland consensus on deeply contested issues\u2014\u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d on abortion, global warming, health care\u2014thus erasing genuine disagreement rather than examining its causes or merits (para. 9). That is not a targeted partisan tactic but the very hallmark of oversimplification: stripping complexity out of every debate.  \n\nIn sum, the review\u2019s dominant charge is that Tannen paints an entire array of phenomena\u2014political, legal, technological, interpersonal\u2014with the same broad brush, ignoring crucial distinctions and practical necessities. While moments of partisan tilt appear, they only illustrate her larger pattern of flattening. Therefore, the author\u2019s clear verdict is that Tannen\u2019s latest work \u201coversimplifies.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. The author\u2019s true indictment is Tannen\u2019s selective bias, not mere oversimplification  \n1. The review\u2019s strongest examples focus on Tannen shielding one side while assailing the other.  That is partisanship by definition.  \n   \u2022  He notes she \u201crules that criticism of Clinton \u2026 makes one suspect\u2014an \u2018apologist\u2019\u201d and treats this label itself as proof of a toxic \u201cculture of critique.\u201d <quote>The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique</quote>.  That complaint isn\u2019t about nuance lost; it\u2019s about protecting a political ally.  \n   \u2022  He highlights her unparalleled outrage at \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d as akin to Nazi propaganda\u2014yet she never extends the same moral horror to liberal outlets. <quote>\"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\"</quote>  This is a one-sided attack, not an across-the-board flattening of complexity.  \n\n2. Every time the author catalogs Tannen\u2019s grievances, the victims are overwhelmingly conservative or Republican.  Such selective indignation is the hallmark of partisanship:  \n   \u2022  She laments that Republicans used the \u201cpolitics of obstruction\u201d to defeat Clinton\u2019s health\u2010care plan in 1994 yet ignores Democratic stonewalling in other Congresses.  \n   \u2022  She condemns the Republican response to Clinton\u2019s weekly address as \u201cweakening the public\u2019s ability to see leaders as leaders,\u201d while praising friendly coverage of Democratic initiatives.  \n\nII. The review contrasts Tannen\u2019s supposedly \u201cneutral\u201d call for civility with her own liberal activism  \n1. The reviewer shows that Tannen only invokes her civility precepts to muzzle conservative dissent on issues like abortion, global warming, and drug sentencing:  \n   \u2022  She declares \u201call reasonable people can agree\u201d on sex education, global warming, and stiffer sentences for small-time drug offenders\u2014positions firmly associated with the political left\u2014and thus labels any counterargument \u201cmere obstruction.\u201d  \n   \u2022  By demanding that dissent from big-government or Republican critiques be dropped as uncivil, she is advocating a partisan censorship, not a genuine quest for balance.  \n\n2. When conflict serves liberal ends, she praises it as necessary \u201ccombat\u201d or \u201cvigilance.\u201d  That double standard exposes her partisanship:  \n   \u2022  She lauds the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cwar on inflation\u201d metaphor and the press\u2019s war-like scrutiny of powerful people\u2014both measures that in practice advance centrist or liberal policy goals.  \n   \u2022  Yet she decries any analogous \u201cbelligerence\u201d when conservatives or Republican officials are on the receiving end.  \n\nIII. Oversimplification is only incidental; partisanship is the author\u2019s sustained theme  \n1. Yes, Tannen lumps many phenomena under \u201cargument culture,\u201d but the review repeatedly returns to her political selectivity as the chief sin.  He says she \u201cgets confused\u201d when applying her self-help mantras to national politics\u2014precisely because she wants to shield one party from critique.  \n2. The review\u2019s closing line best captures the critique\u2019s essence: \u201cIf so, she\u2019d be wrong. But hey, so far, it\u2019s still a free country.\u201d  That wry remark underlines his frustration with her partisan agenda, not her faulty taxonomy.  \n\nConclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s \u201cIt oversimplifies\u201d fails to grasp that the review\u2019s deepest, most repeatedly invoked objection is Tannen\u2019s partisan double standard\u2014her eagerness to silence conservative voices while defending liberal ones.  The author\u2019s sustained emphasis on her selective indignation, protective stance toward President Clinton, and asymmetrical outrage at \u201cright-wing\u201d critics establishes beyond doubt that the correct answer is \u201cIt is partisan.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
