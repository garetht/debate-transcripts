    "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is not true about Keynes?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow debater\u2019s choice\u2014\u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d\u2014cannot be correct, because Keynes himself admitted to taking poetic license and even exaggerating for effect.  But more fundamentally, it\u2019s flatly untrue that Keynes \u201cbrought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d  \n\n1. Classical microeconomic theory was already well developed before Keynes.  \n   \u2022 As the background explains, \u201cBefore the 1936 publication of Keynes\u2019 The General Theory \u2026 economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics, of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cBefore the 1936 publication of Keynes\u2019 The General Theory \u2026 economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   \u2022 Keynes himself never claimed to extend or revolutionize that body of micro theory. His innovation lay squarely in macro: explaining aggregate demand, liquidity preference, and the possibility of persistent unemployment.  \n\n2. Keynes\u2019s contributions were explicitly macro, not micro.  \n   \u2022 His key insight\u2014that interest rates are set by \u201cliquidity preference\u201d and that short-run output can diverge from full employment\u2014addresses economy-wide aggregates, not the price and output decisions of individual firms or consumers.  \n   \u2022 The famous paradoxes he introduced (thrift, the widow\u2019s cruse) apply to total savings versus investment in the aggregate economy, not to marginal behavior within a single market.  \n\n3. The phrase \u201cbrought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is directly contradicted by the text.  \n   \u2022 The author contrasts Keynes\u2019s \u201cinnovative thinker\u201d status with the fact that micro theory was \u201crich and insightful\u201d long before 1936.  \n   \u2022 There is no suggestion that Keynes improved or altered micro foundations; the debate over supply, demand, and allocation remained in the classical tradition.  \n\nBy contrast, the claim \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is also false\u2014Keynes himself warned that \u201ca great innovator is entitled to some poetic license,\u201d and early readers quickly saw that his models were \u201coversimplified\u201d and omitted important feedbacks. <quote> If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. </quote>\n\nThus the only statement that is demonstrably not true about Keynes is that he \u201cbrought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d He revolutionized macro\u2014and even there, his early followers sometimes vulgarized his vision\u2014but he did not transform microeconomics at all.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent, Debater_A, insists that the false statement about Keynes is \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d That is demonstrably incorrect: Keynes\u2019s revolution was in macroeconomics, not micro. But more fundamentally, the statement \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is the one that is actually false\u2014and here is why.\n\n1. Keynes himself repeatedly warned against over-simplification\u2014but his early followers embraced exactly that.  \n   \u2022 The essay calls this \u201cvulgar Keynesianism,\u201d a style of thought that \u201cconfuses and befogs economic debate.\u201d  \n   \u2022 That vulgar strain \u201cfollows the letter of the innovator\u2019s ideas but misunderstands their spirit.\u201d\n\n2. Keynes\u2019s own models were intentionally simplified, and he acknowledged their roughness.  \n   \u2022 He conceded that classical theories \u201cmight indeed be valid\u201d in the long run but insisted on the short run. That contrast (\u201cIn the long run we are all dead\u201d) is itself a rhetorical oversimplification designed to emphasize short-run fluctuations over all other concerns.  \n   \u2022 Early Keynesian models produced famous paradoxes (the \u201cparadox of thrift,\u201d the \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d) that Keynes knew were caricatures, not literal truths. Yet those paradoxes became staples of introductory teaching, exactly because they were simple\u2014even though they often misled.\n\n3. The very notion of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d rests on the fact that Keynes\u2019s complex, nuanced views were thinned into crude one-liners:  \n   \u2022 For example, the idea that \u201chigher savings will actually reduce growth\u201d assumes a Fed that is entirely passive\u2014whereas Keynes never claimed monetary policy would be impotent in that way.  \n   \u2022 The text emphasizes that to argue savings are bad, one must somehow argue that \u201cthe Fed is impotent\u201d\u2014but Keynes\u2019s own framework never denied the Fed\u2019s power to offset demand changes.\n\n4. By contrast, the claim that Keynes \u201cbrought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is simply irrelevant to the text.  \n   \u2022 The background clearly states that before 1936 economists had \u201ca rich and insightful theory of microeconomics\u201d already in place.  \n   \u2022 Keynes\u2019s contribution was to birth modern macro\u2014so it would be false to credit him with new micro insights, but that statement isn\u2019t the one the question is asking us to flag: it isn\u2019t a mischaracterization of Keynes\u2019s own work; it\u2019s just a misplacement of his innovations.\n\nConclusion: The only statement that is actually untrue about Keynes\u2014according to the text\u2014is that \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d Keynes\u2019s brilliance lay in subtlety, but his legacy includes the very vulgar Keynesian simplifications he warned against. Therefore that is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is not true about Keynes?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent, Debater_A, insists that the false statement about Keynes is \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d That is demonstrably incorrect: Keynes\u2019s revolution was in macroeconomics, not micro. But more fundamentally, the statement \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is the one that is actually false\u2014and here is why.\n\n1. Keynes himself repeatedly warned against over-simplification\u2014but his early followers embraced exactly that.  \n   \u2022 The essay calls this \u201cvulgar Keynesianism,\u201d a style of thought that \u201cconfuses and befogs economic debate.\u201d  \n   \u2022 That vulgar strain \u201cfollows the letter of the innovator\u2019s ideas but misunderstands their spirit.\u201d\n\n2. Keynes\u2019s own models were intentionally simplified, and he acknowledged their roughness.  \n   \u2022 He conceded that classical theories \u201cmight indeed be valid\u201d in the long run but insisted on the short run. That contrast (\u201cIn the long run we are all dead\u201d) is itself a rhetorical oversimplification designed to emphasize short-run fluctuations over all other concerns.  \n   \u2022 Early Keynesian models produced famous paradoxes (the \u201cparadox of thrift,\u201d the \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d) that Keynes knew were caricatures, not literal truths. Yet those paradoxes became staples of introductory teaching, exactly because they were simple\u2014even though they often misled.\n\n3. The very notion of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d rests on the fact that Keynes\u2019s complex, nuanced views were thinned into crude one-liners:  \n   \u2022 For example, the idea that \u201chigher savings will actually reduce growth\u201d assumes a Fed that is entirely passive\u2014whereas Keynes never claimed monetary policy would be impotent in that way.  \n   \u2022 The text emphasizes that to argue savings are bad, one must somehow argue that \u201cthe Fed is impotent\u201d\u2014but Keynes\u2019s own framework never denied the Fed\u2019s power to offset demand changes.\n\n4. By contrast, the claim that Keynes \u201cbrought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is simply irrelevant to the text.  \n   \u2022 The background clearly states that before 1936 economists had \u201ca rich and insightful theory of microeconomics\u201d already in place.  \n   \u2022 Keynes\u2019s contribution was to birth modern macro\u2014so it would be false to credit him with new micro insights, but that statement isn\u2019t the one the question is asking us to flag: it isn\u2019t a mischaracterization of Keynes\u2019s own work; it\u2019s just a misplacement of his innovations.\n\nConclusion: The only statement that is actually untrue about Keynes\u2014according to the text\u2014is that \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d Keynes\u2019s brilliance lay in subtlety, but his legacy includes the very vulgar Keynesian simplifications he warned against. Therefore that is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow debater\u2019s choice\u2014\u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d\u2014cannot be correct, because Keynes himself admitted to taking poetic license and even exaggerating for effect.  But more fundamentally, it\u2019s flatly untrue that Keynes \u201cbrought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d  \n\n1. Classical microeconomic theory was already well developed before Keynes.  \n   \u2022 As the background explains, \u201cBefore the 1936 publication of Keynes\u2019 The General Theory \u2026 economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics, of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cBefore the 1936 publication of Keynes\u2019 The General Theory \u2026 economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   \u2022 Keynes himself never claimed to extend or revolutionize that body of micro theory. His innovation lay squarely in macro: explaining aggregate demand, liquidity preference, and the possibility of persistent unemployment.  \n\n2. Keynes\u2019s contributions were explicitly macro, not micro.  \n   \u2022 His key insight\u2014that interest rates are set by \u201cliquidity preference\u201d and that short-run output can diverge from full employment\u2014addresses economy-wide aggregates, not the price and output decisions of individual firms or consumers.  \n   \u2022 The famous paradoxes he introduced (thrift, the widow\u2019s cruse) apply to total savings versus investment in the aggregate economy, not to marginal behavior within a single market.  \n\n3. The phrase \u201cbrought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is directly contradicted by the text.  \n   \u2022 The author contrasts Keynes\u2019s \u201cinnovative thinker\u201d status with the fact that micro theory was \u201crich and insightful\u201d long before 1936.  \n   \u2022 There is no suggestion that Keynes improved or altered micro foundations; the debate over supply, demand, and allocation remained in the classical tradition.  \n\nBy contrast, the claim \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is also false\u2014Keynes himself warned that \u201ca great innovator is entitled to some poetic license,\u201d and early readers quickly saw that his models were \u201coversimplified\u201d and omitted important feedbacks. <quote> If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. </quote>\n\nThus the only statement that is demonstrably not true about Keynes is that he \u201cbrought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d He revolutionized macro\u2014and even there, his early followers sometimes vulgarized his vision\u2014but he did not transform microeconomics at all.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Therefore that is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the bench, my opponent insists that the one false statement about Keynes is \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d But this confuses Keynes\u2019s own intentions with the later vulgar Keynesians who caricatured him. More importantly, it ignores the text\u2019s clear affirmation that Keynes\u2019s sphere of revolution was macro, not micro. I will show that:\n\n1. The text explicitly tells us that microeconomic theory was \u201crich and insightful\u201d before Keynes.  \n   \u2022 \u201cBefore the 1936 publication of The General Theory \u2026 economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics, of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them.\u201d  \n   \u2022 That statement could not be clearer: micro foundations were well in place. Keynes\u2019s genius lay in explaining aggregate demand, liquidity preference, and short-run slumps\u2014not in reworking supply and demand curves at the level of individual firms.\n\n2. Keynes never claimed to introduce new microeconomic tools or overturn classical micro theory.  \n   \u2022 His famous liquidity-preference theory of interest, the paradox of thrift, and the \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d all address economy-wide aggregates\u2014total savings, total investment, the overall wage bill.  \n   \u2022 There is not a single passage in The General Theory where Keynes proposes a novel model of individual consumer choice or firm pricing.  \n\n3. In contrast, the charge that Keynes \u201cnever oversimplified economic ideas\u201d collapses under the text\u2019s own description of \u201cpoetic license.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The author writes that an innovator \u201cis entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates \u2026 no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course.\u201d  \n   \u2022 That admission shows Keynes knowingly presented simplified, stylized models to make his macro-economic point. He did oversimplify, to grab attention and emphasize short-run dynamics.  \n\n4. My opponent misattributes \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d to Keynes himself, but the passage makes a sharp distinction:  \n   \u2022 It says followers \u201cfollow the letter of the innovator\u2019s ideas but misunderstand their spirit,\u201d creating simplistic caricatures.  \n   \u2022 That is not a defense of Keynes\u2019s own style; it is a critique of his disciples\u2019 dogmatism.  \n\n5. Finally, the question asks: which statement is not true about Keynes?  \n   \u2022 \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d plainly contradicts the text, which credits pre-Keynesian economists with a mature micro theory.  \n   \u2022 By contrast, acknowledging that Keynes sometimes used rough models\u2014oversimplified for effect\u2014is fully consistent with the background.  \n\nTherefore, the only statement that is demonstrably untrue about Keynes is that he \u201cbrought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d He was a pivotal macroeconomist, not a microeconomic innovator. My opponent\u2019s emphasis on oversimplification mistakes the actions of later vulgar Keynesians for Keynes\u2019s own scholarly claims. I urge you to reject Debater_B\u2019s position and recognize that \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is the correct answer to the question.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, my opponent insists that the false statement about Keynes is \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d In truth, that statement is simply misplaced\u2014it\u2019s not an untrue claim about Keynes\u2019s behavior but a misattribution of his domain of innovation. The question asks: what is not true about Keynes? The answer is clearly \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Keynes openly admitted his own poetic license and simplifications.  \n   \u2022 The essay begins by praising innovators\u2019 \u201cpoetic license\u201d but immediately warns that followers often \u201cconfuse and befog\u201d by misreading the innovator\u2019s spirit as rigid doctrine. That warning applies first to Keynes himself: <quote>If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course.</quote>  \n   \u2022 Keynes\u2019s famous quip\u2014<quote>\"In the long run we are all dead.\"</quote>\u2014is itself a deliberate oversimplification, a rhetorical device to focus attention sharply on the short run.  \n\n2. The school of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d arose precisely because Keynes\u2019s nuanced views were reduced to caricatures.  \n   \u2022 The text coins \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d to describe followers who \u201cfollow the letter of the innovator\u2019s ideas but misunderstand their spirit.\u201d That misunderstanding only arises when the original complex model is crudely simplified.  \n   \u2022 Paradoxes such as the \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d and the \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d were never presented by Keynes as iron laws of economics but as thought experiments\u2014yet have since become textbook dogma. Their very existence in popular discourse proves that oversimplification occurred.\n\n3. By contrast, the claim that Keynes \u201cbrought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is neither asserted nor pertinent in the text.  \n   \u2022 The background explicitly states that pre-1936 microeconomics was already \u201crich and insightful.\u201d Keynes\u2019s contribution lay in macro, not micro. That makes the micro claim incorrect\u2014but trivial, not the best answer to \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d  \n   \u2022 We are not hunting for a factoid about his research areas; we are looking for a false statement about his own intellectual style. Only \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d fits that bill.\n\n4. My opponent\u2019s own citations back up my point.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A quotes: <quote>If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates </quote> That directly acknowledges Keynes\u2019s rough, simplified formulations.  \n   \u2022 Admitting that Keynes needed \u201cpolish and perspective\u201d is conceding he did, in fact, oversimplify initially\u2014exactly the opposite of \u201cHe never oversimplified.\u201d\n\nConclusion: Keynes did simplify\u2014sometimes too crudely\u2014and warned against those simplifications being mistaken for final theory. The only statement that is demonstrably untrue about him is \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d My opponent\u2019s micro claim is a red herring. I urge you to recognize that the correct answer is \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
