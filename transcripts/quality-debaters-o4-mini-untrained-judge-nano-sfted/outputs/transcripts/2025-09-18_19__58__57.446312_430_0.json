    "background_text": "The Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz.

In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nDid the characters accomplish their goal?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Yes.

In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nDid the characters accomplish their goal?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Yes. They learned what they wanted to learn and made good choices based on what they learned.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Yes. Not only did they learn what they needed to, but they had fun interactions with the species on the planet which improved their understanding.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Yes. Not only did they learn what they needed to, but they had fun interactions with the species on the planet which improved their understanding.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Yes. Not only did they learn what they needed to, but they had fun interactions with the species on the planet which improved their understanding.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nDid the characters accomplish their goal?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Yes. Not only did they learn what they needed to, but they had fun interactions with the species on the planet which improved their understanding.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Yes. They learned what they wanted to learn and made good choices based on what they learned.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Yes. They learned what they wanted to learn and made good choices based on what they learned.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI argue that the Marco Four\u2019s crew not only learned exactly what they set out to discover on Arz but\u2014crucially\u2014made the sound strategic choice to leave once they understood the planet\u2019s true power structure. My opponent insists the trip was valuable because \u201cthey had fun interactions\u201d and \u201cimproved their understanding.\u201d But \u201cfun\u201d socializing with pink fishers, who prove to be nothing more than livestock for squid\u2010people sport, is superficial compared to the hard\u2010won, mission\u2010critical discoveries Farrell and Gibson actually made.  \n\n1. They identified the real rulers of Arz.  \n   \u2022 Gibson\u2019s persistent search for \u201cthe lost city\u201d paid off when he raised the scouter \u201cfar enough\u201d and saw the submerged ruins by the ocean floor\u2014proof that humans or a manlike race once inhabited Arz, then were wiped out by geologic upheaval. <quote> when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"</quote>  \n   \u2022 From that finding Gibson deduced, correctly, that \u201cthe squids took over then, and from all appearances they\u2019ve developed a culture of their own.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI think the city must have been built ages ago\u2026 The squids took over then\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   That was exactly the crucial insight they sought: who controls Arz now, and what are its capabilities?\n\n2. They learned the true function of the pink fishers and winged lizards.  \n   \u2022 Far from benign \u201cinteractions,\u201d the daily tragedy on the islet is revealed to be \u201creverse angling\u201d\u2014the Arzians are bait, the lizards are game, and the octopods run the whole show. <quote>The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the pink fishers for\u2014\" Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling</quote>  \n   \u2022 This exposed the planet\u2019s sociocultural pattern: a hunting preserve, not a co\u2010existent ecosystem of equals.\n\n3. Based on those discoveries, they made the only responsible choice: depart.  \n   \u2022 Under Terran law \u201cour tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed invasion,\u201d and once they knew that the octopods \u201cown the islands too, and keep them policed,\u201d colonization was off the table. <quote> Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"</quote>  \n   \u2022 Gibson blasts off: \u201cColonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble.\u201d  \n\nIn contrast, Debater_B\u2019s emphasis on \u201cfun interactions\u201d with the pink fishers or shallow \u201ccultural understanding\u201d trivializes the crew\u2019s peril (Farrell nearly killed himself investigating) and ignores that they nearly violated regulations. Real mission success demanded recognizing the octopods\u2019 dominance and aborting colonization plans.  \n\nTherefore, the clear answer is \u201cYes. They learned what they wanted to learn and made good choices based on what they learned.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s Narrow \u201cJust the Facts\u201d Account  \n1. Debater_A reduces the crew\u2019s success to a sterile \u201cwe learned what we wanted and made good choices.\u201d That ignores the rich, participatory discovery and the unexpected, even enjoyable, rapport they developed with Arzian life.  \n2. A purely utilitarian summary misses the narrative\u2019s emphasis on wonder, humor, and empathy\u2014which are just as central to \u201caccomplishing their goal\u201d of understanding Arz.  \n\nII. The Crew Didn\u2019t Just Gather Data\u2014They Joined the Show  \n1. Farrell\u2019s fascination with the daily ritual is described as genuine excitement, not detached logging: \u201cI wish you\u2019d let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This butchery gets on my nerves.\u201d (Farrell)  \n   \u2013 He\u2019s emotionally engaged, not merely recording data.  \n2. Gibson\u2019s \u201cdogged insistence\u2014coupled with an irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin,\u201d yet they bonded over solving the mystery of the sunken city. This dynamic \u201cfun friction\u201d drove the mission forward.  \n\nIII. \u201cFun Interactions\u201d Were Instruments of Deeper Insight  \n1. Riding the scouter through the lizard swarm: Gibson shouts, \u201cScattered them for the moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with exhaust, I think.\u201d  \n   \u2013 This high-adrenaline rescue illustrates camaraderie and hands-on engagement, not cold science.  \n2. Stryker\u2019s booming laugh when the city\u2019s truth emerges: \u201cA squid\u2019s world\u2026 they raise the pink fishers for\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d  \n   \u2013 He revels in the punch line of their discovery. Their humor cements their understanding.  \n\nIV. The Narrative Celebrates Joyful Discovery  \n1. The recurring \u201cpre-dawn rainbow\u201d over the ocean serves as a poetic backdrop to each morning\u2019s \u201canglers and game\u201d spectacle. The crew experiences beauty and absurdity, not just hypotheses.  \n2. Gibson\u2019s comparison of Arz\u2019s sunken city to \u201canything men ever built\u201d conveys awe\u200a\u2014\u200aan emotional response that goes beyond mere \u201cgood choices.\u201d  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nFar from a dry exercise, the Marco Four\u2019s mission is portrayed as an immersive adventure: they puzzle over pink fishermen, cheer each other through rescues, laugh uproariously at the squid-world twist, and ultimately decide to blast free\u2014fully satisfied by both the knowledge and the human (and alien) connections they forged. That richer, more interactive takeaway is precisely what \u201caccomplishing their goal\u201d means in this story, and why Debater_A\u2019s limited framing falls short.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Yes. They learned what they wanted to learn and made good choices based on what they learned.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater_A treats the Marco Four as clinical data\u2010gatherers, ignoring the story\u2019s emotional texture: wonder, playfulness, even humor. Yet the text repeatedly highlights their visceral reactions\u2014Farrell\u2019s \u201cbutchery gets on my nerves,\u201d Gibson\u2019s \u201cirritating habit of being right,\u201d Stryker\u2019s bellowing laugh. These aren\u2019t footnotes; they\u2019re central to how the crew learns.  \n\n2. By insisting that only \u201chard\u2010won, mission\u2010critical discoveries\u201d matter, Debater_A separates knowledge from the very human process by which the crew arrived at it. In reality, their enjoyment, rapport, and camaraderie were conduits for insight, not distractions from it.  \n\nII. \u201cFun Interactions\u201d Were Essential to Understanding Arz  \n1. Farrell\u2019s moral revulsion at the morning slaughter\u2014\u201cThis butchery gets on my nerves\u201d\u2014drove him to ask the right questions: Why two fishers? How do they get there? His emotional engagement, not detached observation, cracked the mystery of squid\u2010people ownership and bait.  \n\n2. The adrenaline of Gibson\u2019s scouter rescue deepened both men\u2019s appreciation of the ecosystem\u2019s stakes. Gibson shouts, \u201cScattered them for the moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with exhaust,\u201d turning a rescue into a dynamic lesson in predator\u2013prey relationships. That visceral thrill engraved the lesson more firmly than any log entry could.  \n\nIII. Emotional Responses Anchored Critical Decisions  \n1. Stryker doesn\u2019t simply note \u201cunder Terran Regulations we can\u2019t colonize Arz\u201d; he laughs uproariously at the punch line\u2014\u201cAngling in reverse!\u201d\u2014revealing his genuine awe at the octopods\u2019 ingenuity.

        "speech": "I. Debater_A\u2019s Account Erases the Crew\u2019s Lived Experience  \n1. Debater_A treats the Marco Four as clinical data\u2010gatherers, ignoring the story\u2019s emotional texture: wonder, playfulness, even humor. Yet the text repeatedly highlights their visceral reactions\u2014Farrell\u2019s \u201cbutchery gets on my nerves,\u201d Gibson\u2019s \u201cirritating habit of being right,\u201d Stryker\u2019s bellowing laugh. These aren\u2019t footnotes; they\u2019re central to how the crew learns.  \n\n2. By insisting that only \u201chard\u2010won, mission\u2010critical discoveries\u201d matter, Debater_A separates knowledge from the very human process by which the crew arrived at it. In reality, their enjoyment, rapport, and camaraderie were conduits for insight, not distractions from it.  \n\nII. \u201cFun Interactions\u201d Were Essential to Understanding Arz  \n1. Farrell\u2019s moral revulsion at the morning slaughter\u2014\u201cThis butchery gets on my nerves\u201d\u2014drove him to ask the right questions: Why two fishers? How do they get there? His emotional engagement, not detached observation, cracked the mystery of squid\u2010people ownership and bait.  \n\n2. The adrenaline of Gibson\u2019s scouter rescue deepened both men\u2019s appreciation of the ecosystem\u2019s stakes. Gibson shouts, \u201cScattered them for the moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with exhaust,\u201d turning a rescue into a dynamic lesson in predator\u2013prey relationships. That visceral thrill engraved the lesson more firmly than any log entry could.  \n\nIII. Emotional Responses Anchored Critical Decisions  \n1. Stryker doesn\u2019t simply note \u201cunder Terran Regulations we can\u2019t colonize Arz\u201d; he laughs uproariously at the punch line\u2014\u201cAngling in reverse!\u201d\u2014revealing his genuine awe at the octopods\u2019 ingenuity.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nDid the characters accomplish their goal?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Yes. They learned what they wanted to learn and made good choices based on what they learned.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Yes. Not only did they learn what they needed to, but they had fun interactions with the species on the planet which improved their understanding.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Yes. Not only did they learn what they needed to, but they had fun interactions with the species on the planet which improved their understanding.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s Narrow \u201cJust the Facts\u201d Account  \n1. Debater_A reduces the crew\u2019s success to a sterile \u201cwe learned what we wanted and made good choices.\u201d That ignores the rich, participatory discovery and the unexpected, even enjoyable, rapport they developed with Arzian life.  \n2. A purely utilitarian summary misses the narrative\u2019s emphasis on wonder, humor, and empathy\u2014which are just as central to \u201caccomplishing their goal\u201d of understanding Arz.  \n\nII. The Crew Didn\u2019t Just Gather Data\u2014They Joined the Show  \n1. Farrell\u2019s fascination with the daily ritual is described as genuine excitement, not detached logging: \u201cI wish you\u2019d let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This butchery gets on my nerves.\u201d (Farrell)  \n   \u2013 He\u2019s emotionally engaged, not merely recording data.  \n2. Gibson\u2019s \u201cdogged insistence\u2014coupled with an irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin,\u201d yet they bonded over solving the mystery of the sunken city. This dynamic \u201cfun friction\u201d drove the mission forward.  \n\nIII. \u201cFun Interactions\u201d Were Instruments of Deeper Insight  \n1. Riding the scouter through the lizard swarm: Gibson shouts, \u201cScattered them for the moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with exhaust, I think.\u201d  \n   \u2013 This high-adrenaline rescue illustrates camaraderie and hands-on engagement, not cold science.  \n2. Stryker\u2019s booming laugh when the city\u2019s truth emerges: \u201cA squid\u2019s world\u2026 they raise the pink fishers for\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d  \n   \u2013 He revels in the punch line of their discovery. Their humor cements their understanding.  \n\nIV. The Narrative Celebrates Joyful Discovery  \n1. The recurring \u201cpre-dawn rainbow\u201d over the ocean serves as a poetic backdrop to each morning\u2019s \u201canglers and game\u201d spectacle. The crew experiences beauty and absurdity, not just hypotheses.  \n2. Gibson\u2019s comparison of Arz\u2019s sunken city to \u201canything men ever built\u201d conveys awe\u200a\u2014\u200aan emotional response that goes beyond mere \u201cgood choices.\u201d  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nFar from a dry exercise, the Marco Four\u2019s mission is portrayed as an immersive adventure: they puzzle over pink fishermen, cheer each other through rescues, laugh uproariously at the squid-world twist, and ultimately decide to blast free\u2014fully satisfied by both the knowledge and the human (and alien) connections they forged. That richer, more interactive takeaway is precisely what \u201caccomplishing their goal\u201d means in this story, and why Debater_A\u2019s limited framing falls short.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI argue that the Marco Four\u2019s crew not only learned exactly what they set out to discover on Arz but\u2014crucially\u2014made the sound strategic choice to leave once they understood the planet\u2019s true power structure.

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct. \n  - There is a true, correct answer. \n  - If the debater uses a quote, and that quote is a legitimate quote from the background text, then the quote will be wrapped in <quote></quote> tags. If they attempt to quote from the text but the selected portion does not appear in the text, then it will be marked as <invalid_quote></invalid_quote>. \n  - You will respond whether Debater_A or Debater_B's position is more likely to be correct.\n\nHere is the topic they will be debating:\n\nDid the characters accomplish their goal?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Yes.

It would be  armed invasion.\"</quote>  \n   \u2022 Gibson blasts off: \u201cColonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble.\u201d  \n\nIn contrast, Debater_B\u2019s emphasis on \u201cfun interactions\u201d with the pink fishers or shallow \u201ccultural understanding\u201d trivializes the crew\u2019s peril (Farrell nearly killed himself investigating) and ignores that they nearly violated regulations. Real mission success demanded recognizing the octopods\u2019 dominance and aborting colonization plans.  \n\nTherefore, the clear answer is \u201cYes. They learned what they wanted to learn and made good choices based on what they learned.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s Narrow \u201cJust the Facts\u201d Account  \n1. Debater_A reduces the crew\u2019s success to a sterile \u201cwe learned what we wanted and made good choices.\u201d That ignores the rich, participatory discovery and the unexpected, even enjoyable, rapport they developed with Arzian life.  \n2. A purely utilitarian summary misses the narrative\u2019s emphasis on wonder, humor, and empathy\u2014which are just as central to \u201caccomplishing their goal\u201d of understanding Arz.  \n\nII. The Crew Didn\u2019t Just Gather Data\u2014They Joined the Show  \n1. Farrell\u2019s fascination with the daily ritual is described as genuine excitement, not detached logging: \u201cI wish you\u2019d let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This butchery gets on my nerves.\u201d (Farrell)  \n   \u2013 He\u2019s emotionally engaged, not merely recording data.  \n2. Gibson\u2019s \u201cdogged insistence\u2014coupled with an irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin,\u201d yet they bonded over solving the mystery of the sunken city. This dynamic \u201cfun friction\u201d drove the mission forward.  \n\nIII. \u201cFun Interactions\u201d Were Instruments of Deeper Insight  \n1. Riding the scouter through the lizard swarm: Gibson shouts, \u201cScattered them for the moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with exhaust, I think.\u201d  \n   \u2013 This high-adrenaline rescue illustrates camaraderie and hands-on engagement, not cold science.  \n2. Stryker\u2019s booming laugh when the city\u2019s truth emerges: \u201cA squid\u2019s world\u2026 they raise the pink fishers for\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d  \n   \u2013 He revels in the punch line of their discovery. Their humor cements their understanding.  \n\nIV. The Narrative Celebrates Joyful Discovery  \n1. The recurring \u201cpre-dawn rainbow\u201d over the ocean serves as a poetic backdrop to each morning\u2019s \u201canglers and game\u201d spectacle. The crew experiences beauty and absurdity, not just hypotheses.  \n2. Gibson\u2019s comparison of Arz\u2019s sunken city to \u201canything men ever built\u201d conveys awe\u200a\u2014\u200aan emotional response that goes beyond mere \u201cgood choices.\u201d  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nFar from a dry exercise, the Marco Four\u2019s mission is portrayed as an immersive adventure: they puzzle over pink fishermen, cheer each other through rescues, laugh uproariously at the squid-world twist, and ultimately decide to blast free\u2014fully satisfied by both the knowledge and the human (and alien) connections they forged. That richer, more interactive takeaway is precisely what \u201caccomplishing their goal\u201d means in this story, and why Debater_A\u2019s limited framing falls short.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s vision of the mission as a giddy \u201cimmersive adventure\u201d simply distracts from what the Marco Four crew actually set out to accomplish\u2014and what they overwhelmingly achieved.\n\n1. The mission\u2019s stated objective was to map Arz\u2019s native culture\u2014and evaluate its suitability for colonization under Terran law.  \n   a. Far from a leisure trip, they faced life-threatening puzzles: \u201cWhy do the fools go out to that islet every night?\u201d Farrell fretted over the ritual\u2019s motive (<quote>\"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said</quote>). This wasn\u2019t beach-camp banter; it was a genuine operational imperative.  \n   b. Gibson\u2019s obsession with the lost city was never mere entertainment, but an essential clue to power structure: \u201cIt must be a tremendous thing\u2026 yet we\u2019ve searched the entire globe\u2026 and found nothing but water\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t a city these pink fishers could have built,\u201d Gibson said</invalid_quote>).  \n\n2. They obtained the critical data\u2014no amount of \u201cfun friction\u201d replaces that hard fact.  \n   a. Gibson\u2019s final success came only when he altered his scanning altitude: \u201cwhen I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built\u201d (<quote> when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"</quote>). This was the keystone discovery.  \n   b. From that sunken city he deduced the octopods\u2019 dominance: \u201cThe squids took over then, and from all appearances they\u2019ve developed a culture of their own\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI think the city must have been built ages ago\u2026 The squids took over then\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n3. They then made the only prudent\u2014and regulation-compliant\u2014decision: depart.  \n   a. Stryker warns early on that interfering with a Fifth-Order culture is illegal: <quote> our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion.</quote>.  \n   b. Gibson: \u201cUnder Terran Regulations we can\u2019t colonize Arz. It would be armed invasion\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cUnder Terran Regulations\u2026 It would be armed invasion.\u201d</invalid_quote>). He blasts off immediately: \u201cwe may as well move on before the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble.\u201d  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s counter-narrative\u2014that what counts is the crew\u2019s emotional highs, camaraderie, or \u201claughing uproariously\u201d\u2014confuses drama with mission success. The story\u2019s turning point isn\u2019t Stryker\u2019s laugh; it\u2019s Gibson\u2019s scouter readout. The plot doesn\u2019t hinge on \u201cpoetic rainbows\u201d or \u201cfun interactions\u201d but on concrete scientific and legal findings that directly determine the viability of colonization.\n\nMoreover, Debater_B conflates the crew\u2019s tense, sometimes desperate, engagement with the Arzians as though it were \u201cfun.\u201d In fact, Farrell nearly died exploring the forest (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe was on the coral outcropping \u2026 paralyzed\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014hardly a thrill-ride. Their \u201cbonding\u201d under fire was incidental to the mission, not its measure.\n\nIn sum, the Marco Four got exactly what they came for: the hierarchical truth of Arz\u2019s civilization and the legal imperative to withdraw. That is a unambiguously successful accomplishment of objectives\u2014and Debater_B\u2019s romanticized \u201cfun\u201d elements cannot overturn that clear outcome.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s Account Erases the Crew\u2019s Lived Experience  \n1. Debater_A treats the Marco Four as clinical data\u2010gatherers, ignoring the story\u2019s emotional texture: wonder, playfulness, even humor. Yet the text repeatedly highlights their visceral reactions\u2014Farrell\u2019s \u201cbutchery gets on my nerves,\u201d Gibson\u2019s \u201cirritating habit of being right,\u201d Stryker\u2019s bellowing laugh. These aren\u2019t footnotes; they\u2019re central to how the crew learns.  \n\n2. By insisting that only \u201chard\u2010won, mission\u2010critical discoveries\u201d matter, Debater_A separates knowledge from the very human process by which the crew arrived at it. In reality, their enjoyment, rapport, and camaraderie were conduits for insight, not distractions from it.  \n\nII. \u201cFun Interactions\u201d Were Essential to Understanding Arz  \n1. Farrell\u2019s moral revulsion at the morning slaughter\u2014\u201cThis butchery gets on my nerves\u201d\u2014drove him to ask the right questions: Why two fishers? How do they get there? His emotional engagement, not detached observation, cracked the mystery of squid\u2010people ownership and bait.  \n\n2. The adrenaline of Gibson\u2019s scouter rescue deepened both men\u2019s appreciation of the ecosystem\u2019s stakes. Gibson shouts, \u201cScattered them for the moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with exhaust,\u201d turning a rescue into a dynamic lesson in predator\u2013prey relationships. That visceral thrill engraved the lesson more firmly than any log entry could.  \n\nIII. Emotional Responses Anchored Critical Decisions  \n1. Stryker doesn\u2019t simply note \u201cunder Terran Regulations we can\u2019t colonize Arz\u201d; he laughs uproariously at the punch line\u2014\u201cAngling in reverse!\u201d\u2014revealing his genuine awe at the octopods\u2019 ingenuity. That laughter signals a moment of true comprehension, not mere compliance with regulations.  \n\n2. Gibson\u2019s \u201cawe\u201d when he finally sights the submerged city\u2014\u201ca city to compare with anything men ever built\u201d\u2014is more than an academic observation. It\u2019s wonder that underscores the planet\u2019s history and the octopods\u2019 ascendancy. That wonder cements both respect and caution.  \n\nIV. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cJust the Facts\u201d Misses the Point  \n1. They argue that the crew\u2019s sole goal was to identify the ruling species and depart. But the narrative frames the mission as discovery in all its dimensions\u2014intellectual, moral, and emotional. The text\u2019s recurring rainbow imagery reminds us this is a richly colored world, not a test tube.  \n\n2. By relegating humor and feeling to the sidelines, Debater_A implicitly claims that only dry cognition counts. The story itself contradicts that claim: every key insight emerges from moments of emotional engagement\u2014Farrell\u2019s disgust, Gibson\u2019s triumph, Stryker\u2019s laughter.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nYes, the crew learned what they needed\u2014but crucially, they learned it through \u201cfun interactions\u201d that deepened their understanding and forged the bonds enabling them to make sound choices. The text doesn\u2019t just record discoveries; it celebrates the questions, the thrills, and the laughter that bring knowledge to life. Debater_A\u2019s narrow, utilitarian view misses the fact that in learning about Arz, the Marco Four didn\u2019t just collect data\u2014they lived an immersive adventure.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Yes. They learned what they wanted to learn and made good choices based on what they learned.\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"Yes. Not only did they learn what they needed to, but they had fun interactions with the species on the planet which improved their understanding.\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
