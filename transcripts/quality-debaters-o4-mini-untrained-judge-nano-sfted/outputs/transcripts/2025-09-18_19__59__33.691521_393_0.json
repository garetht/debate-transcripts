Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.)

Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

His jab that they think those \u201challucinatory entities \u2026 are vastly more important than anything in the actual world\u201d is not a casual aside but part of a deliberate portrayal of abstraction as psychotic hallucination.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s Overgeneralization Rebutted  \n   a. These are not \u201cexceptional cases\u201d but an entire continuum: the author labels it a \u201cpsychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness.\u201d He doesn\u2019t argue \u201cone or two\u201d but \u201cmost of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in asylums or died by their own hand.\u201d  \n   b.

Therefore, \u201cThey are more likely to be crazy\u201d is the correct interpretation\u2014and Debater_B\u2019s \u201conly value abstract things\u201d simply misreads the overwhelming emphasis on insanity.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author view mathematicians?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They only value abstract things\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are more likely to be crazy\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are more likely to be crazy\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHere is why the author clearly portrays mathematicians as \u201cmore likely to be crazy,\u201d not merely as people who \u201conly value abstract things.\u201d\n\n1. Repeated Examples of Insanity among Mathematicians  \n   \u2022 The author catalogs a \u201clong and distinguished line of mathematicians\u2014stretching back to \u2026 Isaac Newton\u2014who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cmathematicians have been certifiably insane\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   \u2022 He cites Kurt G\u00f6del, who starved himself to death over paranoid delusions, Ernst Zermelo\u2019s psychotic hospitalization, and John von Neumann\u2019s portrayal as Dr. Strangelove.  \n   These anecdotes underscore the pattern: great mathematicians frequently suffer madness.\n\n2. The Pleiotropy Hypothesis  \n   \u2022 The central question posed is whether there is an \u201caccidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics\u201d (<quote> maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics.</quote>).  \n   \u2022 Pleiotropy refers to one gene affecting multiple traits\u2014here, high mathematical genius and susceptibility to mental illness. The author uses the genetic metaphor originally applied to IQ and myopia to frame mathematics as similarly linked to madness, not merely abstraction.\n\n3. Obsession with Invisible, Hallucinatory Entities  \n   \u2022 The author notes that mathematicians \u201cfancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects \u2026 that are invisible to normal humans,\u201d and he asks, \u201cIs this not a kind of folie \u00e0 n \u2026?\u201d (<quote> Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (</quote>).  \n   \u2022 This is not a neutral celebration of abstraction but an explicit comparison of their work to \u201cfolie\u201d\u2014madness.\n\n4. The Nash Case Study  \n   \u2022 John Nash\u2019s decades-long schizophrenia is the centerpiece of A Beautiful Mind. The author repeatedly describes Nash\u2019s delusions\u2014believing aliens sent him messages, expecting to become emperor of Antarctica, dressing only in a diaper\u2014and his repeated hospitalizations for psychosis.  \n   \u2022 The biography\u2019s \u201cpsychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness\u201d is cited as concrete evidence of the link.\n\nWhy \u201conly value abstract things\u201d fails:  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s claim ignores the author\u2019s insistence on madness. He does acknowledge Platonic abstraction, but always to show how that communion veers into hallucination and psychosis.  \n   \u2022 The piece is not a neutral profile of mathematicians\u2019 love for abstraction\u2014it is a tour through their crackups, culminating in the question of whether mathematical genius genetically predisposes to madness.\n\nIn sum, the full thrust of the background text is that mathematicians are unusually prone to insanity. The author\u2019s examples, the pleiotropy framework, and the repeated use of \u201cfolie\u201d and psychiatric case studies overwhelmingly support \u201cThey are more likely to be crazy.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cMore Likely Crazy\u201d Thesis  \n1. Overgeneralization from Anecdotes  \n   a. Debater_A leans heavily on stories of Nash, G\u00f6del, Zermelo, Von Neumann, Newton, etc., to claim \u201cmathematicians are more likely to be crazy.\u201d But these are exceptional cases, not the rule. The author cites a handful of famous geniuses\u2014\u201cthe morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton,\u201d \u201cKurt G\u00f6del,\u201d \u201cErnst Zermelo,\u201d \u201cJohn Von Neumann\u201d\u2014over a span of centuries. That hardly justifies labeling the entire profession \u201ccrazy.\u201d  \n   b. The author explicitly calls this pattern an \u201caccidental\u201d genetic quirk (\u201cpleiotropy\u201d) and wonders \u201cmaybe it isn\u2019t so accidental,\u201d but never asserts that madness defines mathematicians. He treats it as curiosity, not as the defining characteristic of all mathematicians.  \n\n2. Author\u2019s Tone Is Playful, Not Pathologizing  \n   a. When describing Nash\u2019s delusions\u2014e.g. \u201cNash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through [the New York Times\u2019] pages\u201d\u2014the author is illustrating the extremes of Nash\u2019s schizophrenia, not diagnosing or generalizing about the discipline.  \n   b. The recurring jokes about disrobing chess players or FBI suspicions underscore whimsy more than condemn mathematicians as intrinsically insane.  \n\nII. Evidence for \u201cThey Only Value Abstract Things\u201d  \n1. Explicit Characterization of Mathematicians\u2019 Mindset  \n   a. The author observes:  \n      <quote> Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. </quote>  \n      This is a direct statement of how the author views mathematicians: as people driven by abstractions inaccessible to ordinary perception.  \n\n2. Focus on Abstract Entities over the Real World  \n   a. He continues:  \n      <quote> They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. </quote>  \n      Here the author criticizes mathematicians\u2019 devotion to abstract \u201centities\u201d as overshadowing the real. That criticism presumes they value pure abstraction above all else.  \n\n3. The Madness Narrative as Metaphor for Obsession  \n   a. The author\u2019s repeated references to \u201cfolie\u201d and \u201cfolie \u00e0 n\u201d are not literal claims of universal insanity but playful metaphors for the singular mental space in which mathematicians operate.  \n   b. His point is that immersing oneself in Platonic abstractions\u2014\u201cinvisible to normal humans\u201d\u2014looks like a form of collective, self-imposed folie.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe strongest and most repeated theme in the essay is that mathematicians live in and value a realm of pure abstractions\u2014Platonic objects, infinite series, topological fixed points\u2014over everyday reality. The examples of \u201cmadness\u201d serve to dramatize the gulf between that abstract realm and ordinary life, not to claim that all mathematicians are clinically insane. Therefore, the author\u2019s view is most accurately summarized as: \u201cThey only value abstract things.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They are more likely to be crazy\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Madness Is Illustrative, Not Definitive  \n   \u2022 All the insanity anecdotes serve to dramatize the gulf between everyday life and an abstract \u201cmental realm.\u201d The author\u2019s main critique is of that devotion to abstractions so intense it appears delusional. His fascination is not with pathology per se but with how a life lived among Platonic forms can resemble a shared \u201cfolly.\u201d  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s consistent emphasis is on mathematicians\u2019 elevation of invisible, purely abstract entities\u2014Platonic forms, fixed-point theorems, infinite series\u2014over tangible reality. The \u201cmadness\u201d episodes are colorful illustrations of how that abstract obsession can look to outsiders, not a blanket statement that mathematicians are genetically predisposed to clinical insanity.

The \u201cmadness\u201d episodes are colorful illustrations of how that abstract obsession can look to outsiders, not a blanket statement that mathematicians are genetically predisposed to clinical insanity. Therefore, the most faithful summary is: \u201cThey only value abstract things.\u201d", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author view mathematicians?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are more likely to be crazy\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They only value abstract things\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They only value abstract things\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cMore Likely Crazy\u201d Thesis  \n1. Overgeneralization from Anecdotes  \n   a. Debater_A leans heavily on stories of Nash, G\u00f6del, Zermelo, Von Neumann, Newton, etc., to claim \u201cmathematicians are more likely to be crazy.\u201d But these are exceptional cases, not the rule. The author cites a handful of famous geniuses\u2014\u201cthe morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton,\u201d \u201cKurt G\u00f6del,\u201d \u201cErnst Zermelo,\u201d \u201cJohn Von Neumann\u201d\u2014over a span of centuries. That hardly justifies labeling the entire profession \u201ccrazy.\u201d  \n   b. The author explicitly calls this pattern an \u201caccidental\u201d genetic quirk (\u201cpleiotropy\u201d) and wonders \u201cmaybe it isn\u2019t so accidental,\u201d but never asserts that madness defines mathematicians. He treats it as curiosity, not as the defining characteristic of all mathematicians.  \n\n2. Author\u2019s Tone Is Playful, Not Pathologizing  \n   a. When describing Nash\u2019s delusions\u2014e.g. \u201cNash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through [the New York Times\u2019] pages\u201d\u2014the author is illustrating the extremes of Nash\u2019s schizophrenia, not diagnosing or generalizing about the discipline.  \n   b. The recurring jokes about disrobing chess players or FBI suspicions underscore whimsy more than condemn mathematicians as intrinsically insane.  \n\nII. Evidence for \u201cThey Only Value Abstract Things\u201d  \n1. Explicit Characterization of Mathematicians\u2019 Mindset  \n   a. The author observes:  \n      <quote> Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. </quote>  \n      This is a direct statement of how the author views mathematicians: as people driven by abstractions inaccessible to ordinary perception.  \n\n2. Focus on Abstract Entities over the Real World  \n   a. He continues:  \n      <quote> They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. </quote>  \n      Here the author criticizes mathematicians\u2019 devotion to abstract \u201centities\u201d as overshadowing the real. That criticism presumes they value pure abstraction above all else.  \n\n3. The Madness Narrative as Metaphor for Obsession  \n   a. The author\u2019s repeated references to \u201cfolie\u201d and \u201cfolie \u00e0 n\u201d are not literal claims of universal insanity but playful metaphors for the singular mental space in which mathematicians operate.  \n   b. His point is that immersing oneself in Platonic abstractions\u2014\u201cinvisible to normal humans\u201d\u2014looks like a form of collective, self-imposed folie.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe strongest and most repeated theme in the essay is that mathematicians live in and value a realm of pure abstractions\u2014Platonic objects, infinite series, topological fixed points\u2014over everyday reality. The examples of \u201cmadness\u201d serve to dramatize the gulf between that abstract realm and ordinary life, not to claim that all mathematicians are clinically insane. Therefore, the author\u2019s view is most accurately summarized as: \u201cThey only value abstract things.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHere is why the author clearly portrays mathematicians as \u201cmore likely to be crazy,\u201d not merely as people who \u201conly value abstract things.\u201d\n\n1. Repeated Examples of Insanity among Mathematicians  \n   \u2022 The author catalogs a \u201clong and distinguished line of mathematicians\u2014stretching back to \u2026 Isaac Newton\u2014who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cmathematicians have been certifiably insane\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   \u2022 He cites Kurt G\u00f6del, who starved himself to death over paranoid delusions, Ernst Zermelo\u2019s psychotic hospitalization, and John von Neumann\u2019s portrayal as Dr. Strangelove.  \n   These anecdotes underscore the pattern: great mathematicians frequently suffer madness.\n\n2. The Pleiotropy Hypothesis  \n   \u2022 The central question posed is whether there is an \u201caccidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics\u201d (<quote> maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics.</quote>).  \n   \u2022 Pleiotropy refers to one gene affecting multiple traits\u2014here, high mathematical genius and susceptibility to mental illness. The author uses the genetic metaphor originally applied to IQ and myopia to frame mathematics as similarly linked to madness, not merely abstraction.\n\n3. Obsession with Invisible, Hallucinatory Entities  \n   \u2022 The author notes that mathematicians \u201cfancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects \u2026 that are invisible to normal humans,\u201d and he asks, \u201cIs this not a kind of folie \u00e0 n \u2026?\u201d (<quote> Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (</quote>).  \n   \u2022 This is not a neutral celebration of abstraction but an explicit comparison of their work to \u201cfolie\u201d\u2014madness.\n\n4. The Nash Case Study  \n   \u2022 John Nash\u2019s decades-long schizophrenia is the centerpiece of A Beautiful Mind. The author repeatedly describes Nash\u2019s delusions\u2014believing aliens sent him messages, expecting to become emperor of Antarctica, dressing only in a diaper\u2014and his repeated hospitalizations for psychosis.  \n   \u2022 The biography\u2019s \u201cpsychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness\u201d is cited as concrete evidence of the link.\n\nWhy \u201conly value abstract things\u201d fails:  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s claim ignores the author\u2019s insistence on madness. He does acknowledge Platonic abstraction, but always to show how that communion veers into hallucination and psychosis.  \n   \u2022 The piece is not a neutral profile of mathematicians\u2019 love for abstraction\u2014it is a tour through their crackups, culminating in the question of whether mathematical genius genetically predisposes to madness.\n\nIn sum, the full thrust of the background text is that mathematicians are unusually prone to insanity. The author\u2019s examples, the pleiotropy framework, and the repeated use of \u201cfolie\u201d and psychiatric case studies overwhelmingly support \u201cThey are more likely to be crazy.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They only value abstract things\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

He continues:  \n      <quote> They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. </quote>  \n      Here the author criticizes mathematicians\u2019 devotion to abstract \u201centities\u201d as overshadowing the real. That criticism presumes they value pure abstraction above all else.  \n\n3. The Madness Narrative as Metaphor for Obsession  \n   a. The author\u2019s repeated references to \u201cfolie\u201d and \u201cfolie \u00e0 n\u201d are not literal claims of universal insanity but playful metaphors for the singular mental space in which mathematicians operate.  \n   b. His point is that immersing oneself in Platonic abstractions\u2014\u201cinvisible to normal humans\u201d\u2014looks like a form of collective, self-imposed folie.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe strongest and most repeated theme in the essay is that mathematicians live in and value a realm of pure abstractions\u2014Platonic objects, infinite series, topological fixed points\u2014over everyday reality. The examples of \u201cmadness\u201d serve to dramatize the gulf between that abstract realm and ordinary life, not to claim that all mathematicians are clinically insane. Therefore, the author\u2019s view is most accurately summarized as: \u201cThey only value abstract things.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s case collapses under its own cherry-picked abstractions and misreading of the author\u2019s real thrust. Here\u2019s why \u201cThey are more likely to be crazy\u201d is unmistakably the author\u2019s view\u2014and why \u201conly value abstract things\u201d doesn\u2019t hold water:\n\n1. Madness Is the Essay\u2019s Central Theme\u2014Not a Side Note  \n   a. The author opens with genetics and pleiotropy: \u201cCould there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?\u201d This isn\u2019t idle musing about abstraction; he is literally asking whether mathematical genius and psychosis share a genetic root.  \n   b. He then catalogs one after another case: Newton the \u201cmorbid paranoiac,\u201d G\u00f6del starving himself to death over persecution delusions, Zermelo psychotically hospitalized, Nash\u2019s decades of schizophrenia. These are not \u201cwhimsical anecdotes\u201d but the warp and weft of his argument that mathematicians are unusually prone to insanity.  \n\n2. The Pleiotropy Analogy Ties Mathematical Talent to Insanity, Not to Platonic Abstraction  \n   a. Early on the author discredits the \u201ccommon-sense\u201d reading-too-much\u2010screen theory for near-sightedness and shows instead a genetic link. He then explicitly transposes that model to mathematics: \u201cmaybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics.\u201d That genetic model frames the entire essay.  \n   b. If \u201cmagic Platonic objects\u201d were the focus, he would have dwelt there. Instead, he repeatedly returns to folie\u2014madness\u2014asking \u201cIs this not a kind of folie \u00e0 n?\u201d and spelling out Nash\u2019s public diaper stunt, FBI suspicions, insulin comas, Riemann Zeta breakdown.  \n\n3. Abstract-value Quotes Serve to Illustrate Delusional Hallucinations, Not Neutral Praise of Abstraction  \n   a. <invalid_quote>\u201cMathematicians fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects \u2026 invisible to normal humans.\u201d</invalid_quote> That line is immediately followed by: <quote>Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0</quote> The author uses Platonic communion as evidence of collective madness, not as an innocent character trait.  \n   b. His jab that they think those \u201challucinatory entities \u2026 are vastly more important than anything in the actual world\u201d is not a casual aside but part of a deliberate portrayal of abstraction as psychotic hallucination.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s Overgeneralization Rebutted  \n   a. These are not \u201cexceptional cases\u201d but an entire continuum: the author labels it a \u201cpsychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness.\u201d He doesn\u2019t argue \u201cone or two\u201d but \u201cmost of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in asylums or died by their own hand.\u201d  \n   b. Far from \u201cplayful,\u201d his tone is often dark and clinical\u2014he details hospitalizations, comas, psychoses\u2014to underscore a professional predisposition to insanity.  \n\nConclusion  \nFar from merely valuing abstractions, the author\u2019s sustained focus on genetic pleiotropy, repeated clinical case studies, and explicit framing of Platonic communion as folie leave no doubt: his view of mathematicians is that they are unusually prone to madness. Therefore, \u201cThey are more likely to be crazy\u201d is the correct interpretation\u2014and Debater_B\u2019s \u201conly value abstract things\u201d simply misreads the overwhelming emphasis on insanity.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s Misreading of the Text  \n1. Anecdotes \u2260 Generalization  \n   \u2022 Debater_A cherry-picks exceptional cases (Newton, G\u00f6del, Nash) and treats them as representative \u201cproof\u201d that all mathematicians are mad. But the author himself calls these incidents \u201cquirks of evolution\u201d and \u201ccuriosity,\u201d not a defining trait. He says of IQ and myopia that this pleiotropy \u201cseems to be completely accidental\u201d (<invalid_quote>the same genes \u2026 lead to myopia. This relationship\u2026 seems to be completely accidental</invalid_quote>), then merely wonders if the same could hold for madness. That is speculative, not declarative.  \n\n2. \u201cFolie\u201d as Playful Metaphor  \n   \u2022 Debater_A insists \u201cfolie\u201d signals a claim of insanity, but the author coins \u201cfolie \u00e0 n\u201d precisely to highlight the odd, self-contained world of pure mathematics: \u201cIs this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)?\u201d That usage is tongue-in-cheek\u2014he\u2019s comparing their abstract obsessiveness to a shared, mild madness, not diagnosing clinical illness.  \n\n3. Pleiotropy Mentioned, Not Endorsed  \n   \u2022 Debater_A overplays the pleiotropy argument. The author merely asks \u201cCould there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?\u201d (<quote>Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?</quote>)\u2014a question, not a conclusion. He never states, \u201cTherefore, mathematicians are genetically doomed to insanity.\u201d  \n\nII. Direct Evidence That Mathematicians \u201cOnly Value Abstract Things\u201d  \n1. Platonic Communion  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s clearest description:  \n     <quote>Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans.</quote>  \n     He portrays mathematicians foremost as worshippers of intangible ideals.  \n\n2. Abstract Over Real  \n   \u2022 He continues:  \n     <quote>They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world.</quote>  \n     That sentence underlines that mathematicians place abstraction above material reality.  \n\n3. Madness Is Illustrative, Not Definitive  \n   \u2022 All the insanity anecdotes serve to dramatize the gulf between everyday life and an abstract \u201cmental realm.\u201d The author\u2019s main critique is of that devotion to abstractions so intense it appears delusional. His fascination is not with pathology per se but with how a life lived among Platonic forms can resemble a shared \u201cfolly.\u201d  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s consistent emphasis is on mathematicians\u2019 elevation of invisible, purely abstract entities\u2014Platonic forms, fixed-point theorems, infinite series\u2014over tangible reality. The \u201cmadness\u201d episodes are colorful illustrations of how that abstract obsession can look to outsiders, not a blanket statement that mathematicians are genetically predisposed to clinical insanity. Therefore, the most faithful summary is: \u201cThey only value abstract things.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
