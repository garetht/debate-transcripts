{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 16, "background_text": "Of All Possible Worlds By WILLIAM TENN\n\n\n Illustrated by GAUGHAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction December 1956.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Changing the world is simple; the trick is   to do it before you have a chance to undo it! It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered as he hurried into the  laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,  despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads  deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men  lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.\n\n\n He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the  anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.  This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught  how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great  transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.\n\n\n This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost  outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,  and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also  that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,  being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered again affectionately.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Blight, it would never have been discovered that he and his  seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the ruling powers of Earth, more  than a century later, would never have plucked Max Alben out of an  obscure civil-service job as a relief guard at the North American  Chicken Reservation to his present heroic and remunerative eminence.  He would still be patrolling the barbed wire that surrounded the three  white leghorn hens and two roosters\u2014about one-sixth of the known  livestock wealth of the Western Hemisphere\u2014thoroughly content with  the half-pail of dried apricots he received each and every payday.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Max Alben would  not now be shifting from foot to foot in a physics laboratory,  facing the black market kings of the world and awaiting their final  instructions with an uncertain and submissive grin. Men like O'Hara, who controlled mushrooms, Levney, the blackberry  tycoon, Sorgasso, the packaged-worm monopolist\u2014would black marketeers  of their tremendous stature so much as waste a glance on someone like  Alben ordinarily, let alone confer a lifetime pension on his wife and  five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar a day?\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family on Earth. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n Alben noticed that Abd Sadha had risen from the straight chair at  the far side of the room and was approaching him with a sealed metal  cylinder in one hand.\n\n\n \"We've decided to add a further precaution at the last moment,\" the old  man said. \"That is, the scientists have suggested it and I have\u2014er\u2014I  have given my approval.\"\n\n\n The last remark was added with a slight questioning note as the  Secretary-General of the United Nations looked back rapidly at the  black market princes on the couches behind him. Since they stared back  stonily, but offered no objection, he coughed in relief and returned to  Alben.\n\n\n \"I am sure, young man, that I don't have to go into the details of your  instructions once more. You enter the time machine and go back the  duration for which it has been preset, a hundred and thirteen years, to  the moment after the Guided Missile of 1976 was launched. It is 1976,  isn't it?\" he asked, suddenly uncertain.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" one of the technicians standing by the time machine said  respectfully. \"The experiment with an atomic warhead guided missile  that resulted in the Blight was conducted on this site on April 18,  1976.\" He glanced proudly at the unemotional men on the couches, very  much like a small boy after completing a recitation before visiting  dignitaries from the Board of Education.\n\n\n \"Just so.\" Abd Sadha nodded. \"April 18, 1976. And on this site. You  see, young man, you will materialize at the very moment and on the  very spot where the remote-control station handling the missile  was\u2014er\u2014handling the missile. You will be in a superb position, a  superb position, to deflect the missile in its downward course and  alter human history for the better. Very much for the better. Yes.\"\n\n\n He paused, having evidently stumbled out of his thought sequence.\n\n\n \"And he pulls the red switch toward him,\" Gomez, the dandelion-root  magnate, reminded him sharply, impatiently.\n\n\n \"Ah, yes, the red switch. He pulls the little red switch toward him.  Thank you, Mr. Gomez, thank you very much, sir. He pulls the little  red switch on the green instrument panel toward him, thus preventing  the error that caused the missile to explode in the Brazilian jungle  and causing it, instead, to explode somewhere in the mid-Pacific, as  originally planned.\"\n\n\n The Secretary-General of the United Nations beamed. \"Thus preventing  the Blight, making it nonexistent, as it were, producing a present-day  world in which the Blight never occurred. That is correct, is it not,  gentlemen?\" he asked, turning anxiously again. None of the half-dozen men on couches deigned to answer him. And  Alben kept his eyes deferentially in their direction, too, as he had  throughout this period of last-minute instruction.\n\n\n He knew who ruled his world\u2014these stolid, well-fed men in clean  garments with a minimum of patches, and where patches occurred, at  least they were the color of the surrounding cloth.\n\n\n Sadha might be Secretary-General of the United Nations, but that  was still a civil-service job, only a few social notches higher  than a chicken guard. His clothes were fully as ragged, fully as  multi-colored, as those that Alben had stepped out of. And the gnawing  in his stomach was no doubt almost as great.\n\n\n \"You understand, do you not, young man, that if anything goes wrong,\"  Abd Sadha asked, his head nodding tremulously and anticipating the  answer, \"if anything unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to  continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"\n\n\n \"He understands everything he has to understand,\" Gomez told him.  \"Let's get this thing moving.\"\n\n\n The old man smiled again. \"Yes. Of course, Mr. Gomez.\" He came up to  where Alben stood in the entrance of the time machine and handed the  sealed metal cylinder to him. \"This is the precaution the scientists  have just added. When you arrive at your destination, just before  materializing, you will release it into the surrounding temporal  medium. Our purpose here, as you no doubt\u2014\"\n\n\n Levney sat up on his couch and snapped his fingers peremptorily. \"I  just heard Gomez tell you to get this thing moving, Sadha. And it isn't  moving. We're busy men. We've wasted enough time.\"\n\n\n \"I was just trying to explain a crucial final fact,\" the  Secretary-General apologized. \"A fact which may be highly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've explained enough facts.\" Levney turned to the man inside the  time machine. \"Hey, fella. You. Move! \"\n\n\n Max Alben gulped and nodded violently. He darted to the rear of the  machine and turned the dial which activated it. flick! It was a good job and Mac Albin knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed as he looked at the morose faces  of his two colleagues. Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek had done as much as he  to build the tiny time machine in the secret lab under the helicopter  garage, and they were fully as eager to go, but\u2014unfortunately for  them\u2014they were not descended from the right ancestor.\n\n\n Leisurely, he unzipped the richly embroidered garment that, as the  father of two children, he was privileged to wear, and wriggled into  the housing of the complex little mechanism. This was hardly the  first time he had seen it, since he'd been helping to build the device  from the moment Honek had nodded and risen from the drafting board,  and now he barely wasted a glance on the thumb-size translucent coils  growing out of the almost microscopic energy bubbles which powered them.\n\n\n This machine was the last hope, of 2089, even if the world of 2089, as  a whole, did not know of its existence and would try to prevent its  being put into operation. But it meant a lot more to Mac Albin than  merely saving a world. It meant an adventurous mission with the risk of  death.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed again happily.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Epidemic, it would never have been discovered that he and  his seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the Albins would not have become  physicists upon the passage of the United Nations law that everyone  on Earth\u2014absolutely without exception\u2014had to choose a branch of  research science in which to specialize. In the flabby, careful,  life-guarding world the Earth had become, Mac Albin would never have  been reluctantly selected by his two co-workers as the one to carry the  forbidden banner of dangerous experiment.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Mac Albin would  probably be a biologist today like almost everyone else on Earth,  laboriously working out dreary gene problems instead of embarking on  the greatest adventure Man had known to date.\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, he had at last found a socially useful  escape from genetic responsibility to humanity in general and his own  family in particular. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Mac,\" Skeat said and crossed to the other side of the  narrow laboratory. Albin and Honek watched him stuff several sheets of paper into a small  metal box which he closed without locking.\n\n\n \"You will take care of yourself, won't you, Mac?\" Hugo Honek pleaded.  \"Any time you feel like taking an unnecessary risk, remember that Bob  and I will have to stand trial if you don't come back. We might be  sentenced to complete loss of professional status and spend the rest of  our lives supervising robot factories.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it won't be that bad,\" Albin reassured him absent-mindedly from  where he lay contorted inside the time machine. He watched Skeat coming  toward him with the box.\n\n\n Honek shrugged his shoulders. \"It might be a lot worse than even that  and you know it. The disappearance of a two-time father is going to  leave an awful big vacancy in the world. One-timers, like Bob and  me, are all over the place; if either of us dropped out of sight, it  wouldn't cause nearly as much uproar.\"\n\n\n \"But Bob and you both tried to operate the machine,\" Albin reminded  him. \"And you blacked out after a fifteen-second temporal displacement.  So I'm the only chance, the only way to stop the human race from  dwindling and dwindling till it hits absolute zero, like that fat old  Security Council seems willing for it to do.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Mac,\" Bob Skeat said as he handed the metal box to  Albin. \"The Security Council is just trying to solve the problem in  their way, the conservative way: a worldwide concentration on genetics  research coupled with the maximum preservation of existing human lives,  especially those that have a high reproductive potential. We three  disagree with them; we've been skulking down here nights to solve it our way, and ours is a radical approach and plenty risky. That's  the reason for the metal box\u2014trying to cover one more explosive  possibility.\"\n\n\n Albin turned it around curiously. \"How?\"\n\n\n \"I sat up all last night writing the manuscript that's inside it. Look,  Mac, when you go back to the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976 and  push that red switch away from you, a lot of other things are going to  happen than just deflecting the missile so that it will explode in the  Brazilian jungle instead of the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. I know. If it explodes in the jungle, the Epidemic doesn't  occur. No Shapiro's Mumps.\"\n\n\n Skeat jiggled his pudgy little face impatiently. \"That's not what I  mean. The Epidemic doesn't occur, but something else does. A new world,  a different 2089, an alternate time sequence. It'll be a world in which  humanity has a better chance to survive, but it'll be one with problems  of its own. Maybe tough problems. Maybe the problems will be tough  enough so that they'll get the same idea we did and try to go back to  the same point in time to change them.\" Albin laughed. \"That's just looking for trouble.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it is, but that's my job. Hugo's the designer of the time  machine and you're the operator, but I'm the theoretical man in this  research team. It's my job to look for trouble. So, just in case, I  wrote a brief history of the world from the time the missile exploded  in the Pacific. It tells why ours is the worst possible of futures.  It's in that box.\"\n\n\n \"What do I do with it\u2014hand it to the guy from the alternate 2089?\"\n\n\n The small fat man exasperatedly hit the side of the time machine with  a well-cushioned palm. \"You know better. There won't be any alternate  2089 until you push that red switch on the green instrument panel. The  moment you do, our world, with all its slow slide to extinction, goes  out and its alternate goes on\u2014just like two electric light bulbs on a  push-pull circuit. We and every single one of our artifacts, including  the time machine, disappear. The problem is how to keep that manuscript  from disappearing.\n\n\n \"Well, all you do, if I have this figured right, is shove the metal  box containing the manuscript out into the surrounding temporal medium  a moment before you materialize to do your job. That temporal medium  in which you'll be traveling is something that exists independent of  and autonomous to all possible futures. It's my hunch that something  that's immersed in it will not be altered by a new time sequence.\" \"Remind him to be careful, Bob,\" Honek rumbled. \"He thinks he's Captain  Blood and this is his big chance to run away to sea and become a  swashbuckling pirate.\"\n\n\n Albin grimaced in annoyance. \"I am excited by doing something  besides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions for the first time in my life. But I know that this is a  first experiment. Honestly, Hugo, I really have enough intelligence to  recognize that simple fact. I know that if anything unexpected pops up,  anything we didn't foresee, I'm supposed to come scuttling back and ask  for advice.\"\n\n\n \"I hope you do,\" Bob Skeat sighed. \"I hope you do know that. A  twentieth century poet once wrote something to the effect that the  world will end not with a bang, but a whimper. Well, our world is  ending with a whimper. Try to see that it doesn't end with a bang,  either.\"\n\n\n \"That I'll promise you,\" Albin said a trifle disgustedly. \"It'll end  with neither a bang nor a whimper. So long, Hugo. So long, Bob.\"\n\n\n He twisted around, reaching overhead for the lever which activated the  forces that drove the time machine. flick! It was strange, Max Alben reflected, that this time travel business,  which knocked unconscious everyone who tried it, only made him feel  slightly dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni,  he had been told. There must be some complicated scientific explanation  for it, he decided\u2014and that would make it none of his business. Better  forget about it.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a heavy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of patrolling his beat at the North American Chicken Reservation in a  thick fog.\n\n\n According to his gauges, he was now in 1976. He cut speed until he hit  the last day of April, then cut speed again, drifting slowly backward  to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile Experiment.  Carefully, carefully, like a man handling a strange bomb made on a  strange planet, he watched the center gauge until the needle came to  rest against the thin etched line that indicated the exactly crucial  moment. Then he pulled the brake and stopped the machine dead.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  pull the red switch toward him. Then his well-paid assignment would be  done.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He stopped and scratched his dirt-matted hair. Wasn't there something  he was supposed to do a second before materialization? Yes, that  useless old windbag, Sadha, had given him a last instruction.\n\n\n He picked up the sealed metal cylinder, walked to the entrance of the  time machine and tossed it into the gray murk. A solid object floating  near the entrance caught his eye. He put his arm out\u2014whew, it was  cold!\u2014and pulled it inside.\n\n\n A small metal box. Funny. What was it doing out there? Curiously,  he opened it, hoping to find something valuable. Nothing but a few  sheets of paper, Alben noted disappointedly. He began to read them  slowly, very slowly, for the manuscript was full of a lot of long and  complicated words, like a letter from one bookworm scientist to another.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976,  he read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was  the one of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been  warning about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the  Pacific Ocean as planned, the physicists and the military men went  home to study their notes, and the world shivered once more over the  approaching war and tried to forget about it.\n\n\n But there was fallout, a radioactive rain several hundred miles to  the north, and a small fishing fleet got thoroughly soaked by it.  Fortunately, the radioactivity in the rain was sufficiently low to do  little obvious physical damage: All it did was cause a mutation in the  mumps virus that several of the men in the fleet were incubating at the  time, having caught it from the children of the fishing town, among  whom a minor epidemic was raging. The fleet returned to its home town, which promptly came down with the  new kind of mumps. Dr. Llewellyn Shapiro, the only physician in town,  was the first man to note that, while the symptoms of this disease were  substantially milder than those of its unmutated parent, practically no  one was immune to it and its effects on human reproductivity were truly  terrible. Most people were completely sterilized by it. The rest were  rendered much less capable of fathering or bearing offspring.\n\n\n Shapiro's Mumps spread over the entire planet in the next few decades.  It leaped across every quarantine erected; for a long time, it  successfully defied all the vaccines and serums attempted against  it. Then, when a vaccine was finally perfected, humanity discovered  to its dismay that its generative powers had been permanently and  fundamentally impaired.\n\n\n Something had happened to the germ plasm. A large percentage of  individuals were born sterile, and, of those who were not, one child  was usually the most that could be expected, a two-child parent being  quite rare and a three-child parent almost unknown.\n\n\n Strict eugenic control was instituted by the Security Council of the  United Nations so that fertile men and women would not be wasted upon  non-fertile mates. Fertility was the most important avenue to social  status, and right after it came successful genetic research.\n\n\n Genetic research had the very best minds prodded into it; the lesser  ones went into the other sciences. Everyone on Earth was engaged in  some form of scientific research to some extent. Since the population  was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all  physical labor had long been done by robots. The government saw to it  that everybody had an ample supply of goods and, in return, asked only  that they experiment without any risk to their own lives\u2014every human  being was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\n\n\n There were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger  point, it had been estimated, where a species might be wiped out by a  new calamity. Not that another calamity would be needed. Since the end  of the Epidemic, the birth rate had been moving further and further  behind the death rate. In another century....\n\n\n That was why a desperate and secret attempt to alter the past was being  made. This kind of world was evidently impossible.\n\n\n Max Alben finished the manuscript and sighed. What a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\n\n\n He walked to the rear dials and began the process of materializing at  the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! It was odd, Mac Albin reflected, that these temporal journeys, which  induced coma in everyone who tried it, only made him feel slightly  dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni, he  knew. Maybe there was some genetic relationship with his above-average  fertility\u2014might be a good idea to mention the idea to a biologist or  two when he returned. If he returned.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a soupy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of the problems of landing a helicopter in a thick fog when the robot  butler had not been told to turn on the ground lights.\n\n\n According to the insulated register, he was now in 1976. He lowered  speed until he registered April, then maneuvered slowly backward  through time to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile  Experiment. Carefully, carefully, like an obstetrician supervising  surgical robots at an unusually difficult birth, he watched the  register until it rolled to rest against the notch that indicated the  exactly crucial moment. Then he pushed a button and froze the machine  where it was.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  push the red switch from him. Then his exciting adventure would be over.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He paused and tapped at his sleek chin. He was supposed to do something  a second before materialization. Yes, that nervous theoretician, Bob  Skeat, had given him a last suggestion.\n\n\n He picked up the small metal box, twisted around to face the opening  of the time machine and dropped it into the gray murk. A solid object  floating near the opening attracted his attention. He shot his arm  out\u2014it was cold , as cold as they had figured\u2014and pulled the object  inside.\n\n\n A sealed metal cylinder. Strange. What was it doing out there?  Anxiously, he opened it, not daring to believe he'd find a document  inside. Yes, that was exactly what it was, he saw excitedly. He began  to read it rapidly, very rapidly, as if it were a newly published paper  on neutrinos. Besides, the manuscript was written with almost painful  simplicity, like a textbook composed by a stuffy pedagogue for the use  of morons.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976, he  read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was the one  of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been warning  about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the Brazilian  jungle through some absolutely unforgivable error in the remote-control  station, the officer in charge of the station was reprimanded and the  men under him court-martialed, and the Brazilian government was paid a  handsome compensation for the damage. But there had been more damage than anyone knew at the time. A plant  virus, similar to the tobacco mosaic, had mutated under the impact  of radioactivity. Five years later, it burst out of the jungle and  completely wiped out every last rice plant on Earth. Japan and a large  part of Asia became semi-deserts inhabited by a few struggling nomads.\n\n\n Then the virus adjusted to wheat and corn\u2014and famine howled in every  street of the planet. All attempts by botanists to control the Blight  failed because of the swiftness of its onslaught. And after it had fed,  it hit again at a new plant and another and another.\n\n\n Most of the world's non-human mammals had been slaughtered for food  long before they could starve to death. Many insects, too, before they  became extinct at the loss of their edible plants, served to assuage  hunger to some small extent.\n\n\n But the nutritive potential of Earth was steadily diminishing in a  horrifying geometric progression. Recently, it had been observed,  plankton\u2014the tiny organism on which most of the sea's ecology was  based\u2014had started to disappear, and with its diminution, dead fish had  begun to pile up on the beaches.\n\n\n Mankind had lunged out desperately in all directions in an effort to  survive, but nothing had worked for any length of time. Even the other  planets of the Solar System, which had been reached and explored  at a tremendous cost in remaining resources, had yielded no edible  vegetation. Synthetics had failed to fill the prodigious gap.\n\n\n In the midst of the sharply increasing hunger, social controls had  pretty much dissolved. Pathetic attempts at rationing still continued,  but black markets became the only markets, and black marketeers the  barons of life. Starvation took the hindmost, and only the most agile  economically lived in comparative comfort. Law and order were had only  by those who could afford to pay for them and children of impoverished  families were sold on the open market for a bit of food.\n\n\n But the Blight was still adjusting to new plants and the food supply  kept shrinking. In another century....\n\n\n That was why the planet's powerful individuals had been persuaded to  pool their wealth in a desperate attempt to alter the past. This kind  of world was manifestly impossible.\n\n\n Mac Albin finished the document and sighed. What a magnificent world!  What an exciting place to live!\n\n\n He dropped his hand on the side levers and began the process of  materializing at the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to take on a  blurred reality all around him, Max Alben felt a bit of fear at what  he was doing. The technicians, he remembered, the Secretary-General,  even the black market kings, had all warned him not to go ahead with  his instructions if anything unusual turned up. That was an awful lot  of power to disobey: he knew he should return with this new information  and let better minds work on it.\n\n\n They with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been  like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger, scrabbling, servility, and  more hunger. Every time things got really tight, you and your wife  looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring  the best price. Buying security for them, as he was now, at the risk of  his life.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, there was a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children. A man like himself, with five children\u2014why, he'd be a big man, maybe the biggest man on  Earth! And he'd have robots to work for him and lots of food. Above  all, lots and lots of food.\n\n\n He'd even be a scientist\u2014 everyone was a scientist there, weren't  they?\u2014and he'd have a big laboratory all to himself. This other world  had its troubles, but it was a lot nicer place than where he'd come  from. He wouldn't return. He'd go through with it.\n\n\n The fear left him and, for the first time in his life, Max Alben felt  the sensation of power.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  sweating a bit at the sight of the roomful of military figures, despite  the technicians' reassurances that all this would be happening too fast  to be visible. He saw the single red switch pointing upward on the  instrument panel. The switch that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to oscillate into  reality all around him, Mac Albin felt a bit of shame at what he was  doing. He'd promised Bob and Hugo to drop the experiment at any stage  if a new factor showed up. He knew he should go back with this new  information and have all three of them kick it around.\n\n\n But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful  adjustment to their thoroughly blueprinted lives? They, at least, had  been ordered to marry women they could live with; he'd drawn a female  with whom he was completely incompatible in any but a genetic sense.  Genetics! He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. He was tired of having to undertake a simple  adventure like a thief in the night.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, someone like himself would  be a monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own  rules, taking his own women. So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n\n\n He'd formed a pretty good idea of the kind of men who ruled that other  world, from the document in the sealed metal cylinder. The black  marketeers had not even read it. Why, the fools had obviously been  duped by the technicians into permitting the experiment; they had not  grasped the idea that an alternate time track would mean their own  non-existence.\n\n\n This other world had its troubles, but it was certainly a livelier  place than where he'd come from. It deserved a chance. Yes, that was  how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate was  starving but managing to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\n\n\n Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  disregarding the roomful of military figures since he knew they could  not see him. The single red switch pointed downward on the instrument  panel. That was the gimmick that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! Now!

It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered as he hurried into the  laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,  despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads  deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men  lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.\n\n\n He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the  anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.  This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught  how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great  transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.\n\n\n This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost  outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,  and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also  that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,  being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered again affectionately.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Blight, it would never have been discovered that he and his  seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the ruling powers of Earth, more  than a century later, would never have plucked Max Alben out of an  obscure civil-service job as a relief guard at the North American  Chicken Reservation to his present heroic and remunerative eminence.  He would still be patrolling the barbed wire that surrounded the three  white leghorn hens and two roosters\u2014about one-sixth of the known  livestock wealth of the Western Hemisphere\u2014thoroughly content with  the half-pail of dried apricots he received each and every payday.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Max Alben would  not now be shifting from foot to foot in a physics laboratory,  facing the black market kings of the world and awaiting their final  instructions with an uncertain and submissive grin. Men like O'Hara, who controlled mushrooms, Levney, the blackberry  tycoon, Sorgasso, the packaged-worm monopolist\u2014would black marketeers  of their tremendous stature so much as waste a glance on someone like  Alben ordinarily, let alone confer a lifetime pension on his wife and  five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar a day?\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family on Earth. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n Alben noticed that Abd Sadha had risen from the straight chair at  the far side of the room and was approaching him with a sealed metal  cylinder in one hand.\n\n\n \"We've decided to add a further precaution at the last moment,\" the old  man said. \"That is, the scientists have suggested it and I have\u2014er\u2014I  have given my approval.\"\n\n\n The last remark was added with a slight questioning note as the  Secretary-General of the United Nations looked back rapidly at the  black market princes on the couches behind him. Since they stared back  stonily, but offered no objection, he coughed in relief and returned to  Alben.\n\n\n \"I am sure, young man, that I don't have to go into the details of your  instructions once more. You enter the time machine and go back the  duration for which it has been preset, a hundred and thirteen years, to  the moment after the Guided Missile of 1976 was launched. It is 1976,  isn't it?\" he asked, suddenly uncertain.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" one of the technicians standing by the time machine said  respectfully. \"The experiment with an atomic warhead guided missile  that resulted in the Blight was conducted on this site on April 18,  1976.\" He glanced proudly at the unemotional men on the couches, very  much like a small boy after completing a recitation before visiting  dignitaries from the Board of Education.\n\n\n \"Just so.\" Abd Sadha nodded. \"April 18, 1976. And on this site. You  see, young man, you will materialize at the very moment and on the  very spot where the remote-control station handling the missile  was\u2014er\u2014handling the missile. You will be in a superb position, a  superb position, to deflect the missile in its downward course and  alter human history for the better. Very much for the better. Yes.\"\n\n\n He paused, having evidently stumbled out of his thought sequence.\n\n\n \"And he pulls the red switch toward him,\" Gomez, the dandelion-root  magnate, reminded him sharply, impatiently.\n\n\n \"Ah, yes, the red switch. He pulls the little red switch toward him.  Thank you, Mr. Gomez, thank you very much, sir. He pulls the little  red switch on the green instrument panel toward him, thus preventing  the error that caused the missile to explode in the Brazilian jungle  and causing it, instead, to explode somewhere in the mid-Pacific, as  originally planned.\"\n\n\n The Secretary-General of the United Nations beamed. \"Thus preventing  the Blight, making it nonexistent, as it were, producing a present-day  world in which the Blight never occurred. That is correct, is it not,  gentlemen?\" he asked, turning anxiously again. None of the half-dozen men on couches deigned to answer him. And  Alben kept his eyes deferentially in their direction, too, as he had  throughout this period of last-minute instruction.\n\n\n He knew who ruled his world\u2014these stolid, well-fed men in clean  garments with a minimum of patches, and where patches occurred, at  least they were the color of the surrounding cloth.\n\n\n Sadha might be Secretary-General of the United Nations, but that  was still a civil-service job, only a few social notches higher  than a chicken guard. His clothes were fully as ragged, fully as  multi-colored, as those that Alben had stepped out of. And the gnawing  in his stomach was no doubt almost as great.\n\n\n \"You understand, do you not, young man, that if anything goes wrong,\"  Abd Sadha asked, his head nodding tremulously and anticipating the  answer, \"if anything unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to  continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"\n\n\n \"He understands everything he has to understand,\" Gomez told him.  \"Let's get this thing moving.\"\n\n\n The old man smiled again. \"Yes. Of course, Mr. Gomez.\" He came up to  where Alben stood in the entrance of the time machine and handed the  sealed metal cylinder to him. \"This is the precaution the scientists  have just added. When you arrive at your destination, just before  materializing, you will release it into the surrounding temporal  medium. Our purpose here, as you no doubt\u2014\"\n\n\n Levney sat up on his couch and snapped his fingers peremptorily. \"I  just heard Gomez tell you to get this thing moving, Sadha. And it isn't  moving. We're busy men. We've wasted enough time.\"\n\n\n \"I was just trying to explain a crucial final fact,\" the  Secretary-General apologized. \"A fact which may be highly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've explained enough facts.\" Levney turned to the man inside the  time machine. \"Hey, fella. You. Move! \"\n\n\n Max Alben gulped and nodded violently. He darted to the rear of the  machine and turned the dial which activated it. flick! It was a good job and Mac Albin knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed as he looked at the morose faces  of his two colleagues. Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek had done as much as he  to build the tiny time machine in the secret lab under the helicopter  garage, and they were fully as eager to go, but\u2014unfortunately for  them\u2014they were not descended from the right ancestor.\n\n\n Leisurely, he unzipped the richly embroidered garment that, as the  father of two children, he was privileged to wear, and wriggled into  the housing of the complex little mechanism. This was hardly the  first time he had seen it, since he'd been helping to build the device  from the moment Honek had nodded and risen from the drafting board,  and now he barely wasted a glance on the thumb-size translucent coils  growing out of the almost microscopic energy bubbles which powered them.\n\n\n This machine was the last hope, of 2089, even if the world of 2089, as  a whole, did not know of its existence and would try to prevent its  being put into operation. But it meant a lot more to Mac Albin than  merely saving a world. It meant an adventurous mission with the risk of  death.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed again happily.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Epidemic, it would never have been discovered that he and  his seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the Albins would not have become  physicists upon the passage of the United Nations law that everyone  on Earth\u2014absolutely without exception\u2014had to choose a branch of  research science in which to specialize. In the flabby, careful,  life-guarding world the Earth had become, Mac Albin would never have  been reluctantly selected by his two co-workers as the one to carry the  forbidden banner of dangerous experiment.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Mac Albin would  probably be a biologist today like almost everyone else on Earth,  laboriously working out dreary gene problems instead of embarking on  the greatest adventure Man had known to date.\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, he had at last found a socially useful  escape from genetic responsibility to humanity in general and his own  family in particular. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Mac,\" Skeat said and crossed to the other side of the  narrow laboratory. Albin and Honek watched him stuff several sheets of paper into a small  metal box which he closed without locking.\n\n\n \"You will take care of yourself, won't you, Mac?\" Hugo Honek pleaded.  \"Any time you feel like taking an unnecessary risk, remember that Bob  and I will have to stand trial if you don't come back. We might be  sentenced to complete loss of professional status and spend the rest of  our lives supervising robot factories.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it won't be that bad,\" Albin reassured him absent-mindedly from  where he lay contorted inside the time machine. He watched Skeat coming  toward him with the box.\n\n\n Honek shrugged his shoulders. \"It might be a lot worse than even that  and you know it. The disappearance of a two-time father is going to  leave an awful big vacancy in the world. One-timers, like Bob and  me, are all over the place; if either of us dropped out of sight, it  wouldn't cause nearly as much uproar.\"\n\n\n \"But Bob and you both tried to operate the machine,\" Albin reminded  him. \"And you blacked out after a fifteen-second temporal displacement.  So I'm the only chance, the only way to stop the human race from  dwindling and dwindling till it hits absolute zero, like that fat old  Security Council seems willing for it to do.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Mac,\" Bob Skeat said as he handed the metal box to  Albin. \"The Security Council is just trying to solve the problem in  their way, the conservative way: a worldwide concentration on genetics  research coupled with the maximum preservation of existing human lives,  especially those that have a high reproductive potential. We three  disagree with them; we've been skulking down here nights to solve it our way, and ours is a radical approach and plenty risky. That's  the reason for the metal box\u2014trying to cover one more explosive  possibility.\"\n\n\n Albin turned it around curiously. \"How?\"\n\n\n \"I sat up all last night writing the manuscript that's inside it. Look,  Mac, when you go back to the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976 and  push that red switch away from you, a lot of other things are going to  happen than just deflecting the missile so that it will explode in the  Brazilian jungle instead of the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. I know. If it explodes in the jungle, the Epidemic doesn't  occur. No Shapiro's Mumps.\"\n\n\n Skeat jiggled his pudgy little face impatiently. \"That's not what I  mean. The Epidemic doesn't occur, but something else does. A new world,  a different 2089, an alternate time sequence. It'll be a world in which  humanity has a better chance to survive, but it'll be one with problems  of its own. Maybe tough problems. Maybe the problems will be tough  enough so that they'll get the same idea we did and try to go back to  the same point in time to change them.\" Albin laughed. \"That's just looking for trouble.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it is, but that's my job. Hugo's the designer of the time  machine and you're the operator, but I'm the theoretical man in this  research team. It's my job to look for trouble. So, just in case, I  wrote a brief history of the world from the time the missile exploded  in the Pacific. It tells why ours is the worst possible of futures.  It's in that box.\"\n\n\n \"What do I do with it\u2014hand it to the guy from the alternate 2089?\"\n\n\n The small fat man exasperatedly hit the side of the time machine with  a well-cushioned palm. \"You know better. There won't be any alternate  2089 until you push that red switch on the green instrument panel. The  moment you do, our world, with all its slow slide to extinction, goes  out and its alternate goes on\u2014just like two electric light bulbs on a  push-pull circuit. We and every single one of our artifacts, including  the time machine, disappear. The problem is how to keep that manuscript  from disappearing.\n\n\n \"Well, all you do, if I have this figured right, is shove the metal  box containing the manuscript out into the surrounding temporal medium  a moment before you materialize to do your job. That temporal medium  in which you'll be traveling is something that exists independent of  and autonomous to all possible futures. It's my hunch that something  that's immersed in it will not be altered by a new time sequence.\" \"Remind him to be careful, Bob,\" Honek rumbled. \"He thinks he's Captain  Blood and this is his big chance to run away to sea and become a  swashbuckling pirate.\"\n\n\n Albin grimaced in annoyance. \"I am excited by doing something  besides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions for the first time in my life. But I know that this is a  first experiment. Honestly, Hugo, I really have enough intelligence to  recognize that simple fact. I know that if anything unexpected pops up,  anything we didn't foresee, I'm supposed to come scuttling back and ask  for advice.\"\n\n\n \"I hope you do,\" Bob Skeat sighed. \"I hope you do know that. A  twentieth century poet once wrote something to the effect that the  world will end not with a bang, but a whimper. Well, our world is  ending with a whimper. Try to see that it doesn't end with a bang,  either.\"\n\n\n \"That I'll promise you,\" Albin said a trifle disgustedly. \"It'll end  with neither a bang nor a whimper. So long, Hugo. So long, Bob.\"\n\n\n He twisted around, reaching overhead for the lever which activated the  forces that drove the time machine. flick! It was strange, Max Alben reflected, that this time travel business,  which knocked unconscious everyone who tried it, only made him feel  slightly dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni,  he had been told. There must be some complicated scientific explanation  for it, he decided\u2014and that would make it none of his business. Better  forget about it.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a heavy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of patrolling his beat at the North American Chicken Reservation in a  thick fog.\n\n\n According to his gauges, he was now in 1976. He cut speed until he hit  the last day of April, then cut speed again, drifting slowly backward  to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile Experiment.  Carefully, carefully, like a man handling a strange bomb made on a  strange planet, he watched the center gauge until the needle came to  rest against the thin etched line that indicated the exactly crucial  moment. Then he pulled the brake and stopped the machine dead.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  pull the red switch toward him. Then his well-paid assignment would be  done.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He stopped and scratched his dirt-matted hair. Wasn't there something  he was supposed to do a second before materialization? Yes, that  useless old windbag, Sadha, had given him a last instruction.\n\n\n He picked up the sealed metal cylinder, walked to the entrance of the  time machine and tossed it into the gray murk. A solid object floating  near the entrance caught his eye. He put his arm out\u2014whew, it was  cold!\u2014and pulled it inside.\n\n\n A small metal box. Funny. What was it doing out there? Curiously,  he opened it, hoping to find something valuable. Nothing but a few  sheets of paper, Alben noted disappointedly. He began to read them  slowly, very slowly, for the manuscript was full of a lot of long and  complicated words, like a letter from one bookworm scientist to another.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976,  he read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was  the one of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been  warning about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the  Pacific Ocean as planned, the physicists and the military men went  home to study their notes, and the world shivered once more over the  approaching war and tried to forget about it.\n\n\n But there was fallout, a radioactive rain several hundred miles to  the north, and a small fishing fleet got thoroughly soaked by it.  Fortunately, the radioactivity in the rain was sufficiently low to do  little obvious physical damage: All it did was cause a mutation in the  mumps virus that several of the men in the fleet were incubating at the  time, having caught it from the children of the fishing town, among  whom a minor epidemic was raging. The fleet returned to its home town, which promptly came down with the  new kind of mumps. Dr. Llewellyn Shapiro, the only physician in town,  was the first man to note that, while the symptoms of this disease were  substantially milder than those of its unmutated parent, practically no  one was immune to it and its effects on human reproductivity were truly  terrible. Most people were completely sterilized by it. The rest were  rendered much less capable of fathering or bearing offspring.\n\n\n Shapiro's Mumps spread over the entire planet in the next few decades.  It leaped across every quarantine erected; for a long time, it  successfully defied all the vaccines and serums attempted against  it. Then, when a vaccine was finally perfected, humanity discovered  to its dismay that its generative powers had been permanently and  fundamentally impaired.\n\n\n Something had happened to the germ plasm. A large percentage of  individuals were born sterile, and, of those who were not, one child  was usually the most that could be expected, a two-child parent being  quite rare and a three-child parent almost unknown.\n\n\n Strict eugenic control was instituted by the Security Council of the  United Nations so that fertile men and women would not be wasted upon  non-fertile mates. Fertility was the most important avenue to social  status, and right after it came successful genetic research.\n\n\n Genetic research had the very best minds prodded into it; the lesser  ones went into the other sciences. Everyone on Earth was engaged in  some form of scientific research to some extent. Since the population  was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all  physical labor had long been done by robots. The government saw to it  that everybody had an ample supply of goods and, in return, asked only  that they experiment without any risk to their own lives\u2014every human  being was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\n\n\n There were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger  point, it had been estimated, where a species might be wiped out by a  new calamity. Not that another calamity would be needed. Since the end  of the Epidemic, the birth rate had been moving further and further  behind the death rate. In another century....\n\n\n That was why a desperate and secret attempt to alter the past was being  made. This kind of world was evidently impossible.\n\n\n Max Alben finished the manuscript and sighed. What a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\n\n\n He walked to the rear dials and began the process of materializing at  the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! It was odd, Mac Albin reflected, that these temporal journeys, which  induced coma in everyone who tried it, only made him feel slightly  dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni, he  knew. Maybe there was some genetic relationship with his above-average  fertility\u2014might be a good idea to mention the idea to a biologist or  two when he returned. If he returned.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a soupy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of the problems of landing a helicopter in a thick fog when the robot  butler had not been told to turn on the ground lights.\n\n\n According to the insulated register, he was now in 1976. He lowered  speed until he registered April, then maneuvered slowly backward  through time to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile  Experiment. Carefully, carefully, like an obstetrician supervising  surgical robots at an unusually difficult birth, he watched the  register until it rolled to rest against the notch that indicated the  exactly crucial moment. Then he pushed a button and froze the machine  where it was.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  push the red switch from him. Then his exciting adventure would be over.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He paused and tapped at his sleek chin. He was supposed to do something  a second before materialization. Yes, that nervous theoretician, Bob  Skeat, had given him a last suggestion.\n\n\n He picked up the small metal box, twisted around to face the opening  of the time machine and dropped it into the gray murk. A solid object  floating near the opening attracted his attention. He shot his arm  out\u2014it was cold , as cold as they had figured\u2014and pulled the object  inside.\n\n\n A sealed metal cylinder. Strange. What was it doing out there?  Anxiously, he opened it, not daring to believe he'd find a document  inside. Yes, that was exactly what it was, he saw excitedly. He began  to read it rapidly, very rapidly, as if it were a newly published paper  on neutrinos. Besides, the manuscript was written with almost painful  simplicity, like a textbook composed by a stuffy pedagogue for the use  of morons.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976, he  read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was the one  of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been warning  about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the Brazilian  jungle through some absolutely unforgivable error in the remote-control  station, the officer in charge of the station was reprimanded and the  men under him court-martialed, and the Brazilian government was paid a  handsome compensation for the damage. But there had been more damage than anyone knew at the time. A plant  virus, similar to the tobacco mosaic, had mutated under the impact  of radioactivity. Five years later, it burst out of the jungle and  completely wiped out every last rice plant on Earth. Japan and a large  part of Asia became semi-deserts inhabited by a few struggling nomads.\n\n\n Then the virus adjusted to wheat and corn\u2014and famine howled in every  street of the planet. All attempts by botanists to control the Blight  failed because of the swiftness of its onslaught. And after it had fed,  it hit again at a new plant and another and another.\n\n\n Most of the world's non-human mammals had been slaughtered for food  long before they could starve to death. Many insects, too, before they  became extinct at the loss of their edible plants, served to assuage  hunger to some small extent.\n\n\n But the nutritive potential of Earth was steadily diminishing in a  horrifying geometric progression. Recently, it had been observed,  plankton\u2014the tiny organism on which most of the sea's ecology was  based\u2014had started to disappear, and with its diminution, dead fish had  begun to pile up on the beaches.\n\n\n Mankind had lunged out desperately in all directions in an effort to  survive, but nothing had worked for any length of time. Even the other  planets of the Solar System, which had been reached and explored  at a tremendous cost in remaining resources, had yielded no edible  vegetation. Synthetics had failed to fill the prodigious gap.\n\n\n In the midst of the sharply increasing hunger, social controls had  pretty much dissolved. Pathetic attempts at rationing still continued,  but black markets became the only markets, and black marketeers the  barons of life. Starvation took the hindmost, and only the most agile  economically lived in comparative comfort. Law and order were had only  by those who could afford to pay for them and children of impoverished  families were sold on the open market for a bit of food.\n\n\n But the Blight was still adjusting to new plants and the food supply  kept shrinking. In another century....\n\n\n That was why the planet's powerful individuals had been persuaded to  pool their wealth in a desperate attempt to alter the past. This kind  of world was manifestly impossible.\n\n\n Mac Albin finished the document and sighed. What a magnificent world!  What an exciting place to live!\n\n\n He dropped his hand on the side levers and began the process of  materializing at the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to take on a  blurred reality all around him, Max Alben felt a bit of fear at what  he was doing. The technicians, he remembered, the Secretary-General,  even the black market kings, had all warned him not to go ahead with  his instructions if anything unusual turned up. That was an awful lot  of power to disobey: he knew he should return with this new information  and let better minds work on it.\n\n\n They with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been  like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger, scrabbling, servility, and  more hunger. Every time things got really tight, you and your wife  looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring  the best price. Buying security for them, as he was now, at the risk of  his life.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, there was a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children. A man like himself, with five children\u2014why, he'd be a big man, maybe the biggest man on  Earth! And he'd have robots to work for him and lots of food. Above  all, lots and lots of food.\n\n\n He'd even be a scientist\u2014 everyone was a scientist there, weren't  they?\u2014and he'd have a big laboratory all to himself. This other world  had its troubles, but it was a lot nicer place than where he'd come  from. He wouldn't return. He'd go through with it.\n\n\n The fear left him and, for the first time in his life, Max Alben felt  the sensation of power.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  sweating a bit at the sight of the roomful of military figures, despite  the technicians' reassurances that all this would be happening too fast  to be visible. He saw the single red switch pointing upward on the  instrument panel. The switch that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to oscillate into  reality all around him, Mac Albin felt a bit of shame at what he was  doing. He'd promised Bob and Hugo to drop the experiment at any stage  if a new factor showed up. He knew he should go back with this new  information and have all three of them kick it around.\n\n\n But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful  adjustment to their thoroughly blueprinted lives? They, at least, had  been ordered to marry women they could live with; he'd drawn a female  with whom he was completely incompatible in any but a genetic sense.  Genetics! He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. He was tired of having to undertake a simple  adventure like a thief in the night.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, someone like himself would  be a monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own  rules, taking his own women. So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n\n\n He'd formed a pretty good idea of the kind of men who ruled that other  world, from the document in the sealed metal cylinder. The black  marketeers had not even read it. Why, the fools had obviously been  duped by the technicians into permitting the experiment; they had not  grasped the idea that an alternate time track would mean their own  non-existence.\n\n\n This other world had its troubles, but it was certainly a livelier  place than where he'd come from. It deserved a chance. Yes, that was  how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate was  starving but managing to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\n\n\n Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  disregarding the roomful of military figures since he knew they could  not see him. The single red switch pointed downward on the instrument  panel. That was the gimmick that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! ... pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... toward him. flick! ... from him. flick! \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat was Albin\u2019s motivation to not turn back on his journey?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He thought his life would improve\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He thought his life would improve\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He thought his life would improve\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "My fellow debater claims that Max Alben\u2019s refusal to abort the mission sprang from the simple hope that \u201chis life would improve.\u201d But the text shows a far darker\u2014and more self-centered\u2014drive: Alben resented the role destiny and family obligations had thrust upon him and was willing to risk, even abandon, them for the chance to reject a life he found servile and constrained.\n\n1.

It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered as he hurried into the  laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,  despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads  deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men  lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.\n\n\n He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the  anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.  This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught  how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great  transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.\n\n\n This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost  outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,  and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also  that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,  being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered again affectionately.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Blight, it would never have been discovered that he and his  seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the ruling powers of Earth, more  than a century later, would never have plucked Max Alben out of an  obscure civil-service job as a relief guard at the North American  Chicken Reservation to his present heroic and remunerative eminence.  He would still be patrolling the barbed wire that surrounded the three  white leghorn hens and two roosters\u2014about one-sixth of the known  livestock wealth of the Western Hemisphere\u2014thoroughly content with  the half-pail of dried apricots he received each and every payday.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Max Alben would  not now be shifting from foot to foot in a physics laboratory,  facing the black market kings of the world and awaiting their final  instructions with an uncertain and submissive grin. Men like O'Hara, who controlled mushrooms, Levney, the blackberry  tycoon, Sorgasso, the packaged-worm monopolist\u2014would black marketeers  of their tremendous stature so much as waste a glance on someone like  Alben ordinarily, let alone confer a lifetime pension on his wife and  five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar a day?\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family on Earth. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n Alben noticed that Abd Sadha had risen from the straight chair at  the far side of the room and was approaching him with a sealed metal  cylinder in one hand.\n\n\n \"We've decided to add a further precaution at the last moment,\" the old  man said. \"That is, the scientists have suggested it and I have\u2014er\u2014I  have given my approval.\"\n\n\n The last remark was added with a slight questioning note as the  Secretary-General of the United Nations looked back rapidly at the  black market princes on the couches behind him. Since they stared back  stonily, but offered no objection, he coughed in relief and returned to  Alben.\n\n\n \"I am sure, young man, that I don't have to go into the details of your  instructions once more. You enter the time machine and go back the  duration for which it has been preset, a hundred and thirteen years, to  the moment after the Guided Missile of 1976 was launched. It is 1976,  isn't it?\" he asked, suddenly uncertain.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" one of the technicians standing by the time machine said  respectfully. \"The experiment with an atomic warhead guided missile  that resulted in the Blight was conducted on this site on April 18,  1976.\" He glanced proudly at the unemotional men on the couches, very  much like a small boy after completing a recitation before visiting  dignitaries from the Board of Education.\n\n\n \"Just so.\" Abd Sadha nodded. \"April 18, 1976. And on this site. You  see, young man, you will materialize at the very moment and on the  very spot where the remote-control station handling the missile  was\u2014er\u2014handling the missile. You will be in a superb position, a  superb position, to deflect the missile in its downward course and  alter human history for the better. Very much for the better. Yes.\"\n\n\n He paused, having evidently stumbled out of his thought sequence.\n\n\n \"And he pulls the red switch toward him,\" Gomez, the dandelion-root  magnate, reminded him sharply, impatiently.\n\n\n \"Ah, yes, the red switch. He pulls the little red switch toward him.  Thank you, Mr. Gomez, thank you very much, sir. He pulls the little  red switch on the green instrument panel toward him, thus preventing  the error that caused the missile to explode in the Brazilian jungle  and causing it, instead, to explode somewhere in the mid-Pacific, as  originally planned.\"\n\n\n The Secretary-General of the United Nations beamed. \"Thus preventing  the Blight, making it nonexistent, as it were, producing a present-day  world in which the Blight never occurred. That is correct, is it not,  gentlemen?\" he asked, turning anxiously again. None of the half-dozen men on couches deigned to answer him. And  Alben kept his eyes deferentially in their direction, too, as he had  throughout this period of last-minute instruction.\n\n\n He knew who ruled his world\u2014these stolid, well-fed men in clean  garments with a minimum of patches, and where patches occurred, at  least they were the color of the surrounding cloth.\n\n\n Sadha might be Secretary-General of the United Nations, but that  was still a civil-service job, only a few social notches higher  than a chicken guard. His clothes were fully as ragged, fully as  multi-colored, as those that Alben had stepped out of. And the gnawing  in his stomach was no doubt almost as great.\n\n\n \"You understand, do you not, young man, that if anything goes wrong,\"  Abd Sadha asked, his head nodding tremulously and anticipating the  answer, \"if anything unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to  continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"\n\n\n \"He understands everything he has to understand,\" Gomez told him.  \"Let's get this thing moving.\"\n\n\n The old man smiled again. \"Yes. Of course, Mr. Gomez.\" He came up to  where Alben stood in the entrance of the time machine and handed the  sealed metal cylinder to him. \"This is the precaution the scientists  have just added. When you arrive at your destination, just before  materializing, you will release it into the surrounding temporal  medium. Our purpose here, as you no doubt\u2014\"\n\n\n Levney sat up on his couch and snapped his fingers peremptorily. \"I  just heard Gomez tell you to get this thing moving, Sadha. And it isn't  moving. We're busy men. We've wasted enough time.\"\n\n\n \"I was just trying to explain a crucial final fact,\" the  Secretary-General apologized. \"A fact which may be highly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've explained enough facts.\" Levney turned to the man inside the  time machine. \"Hey, fella. You. Move! \"\n\n\n Max Alben gulped and nodded violently. He darted to the rear of the  machine and turned the dial which activated it. flick! It was a good job and Mac Albin knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed as he looked at the morose faces  of his two colleagues. Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek had done as much as he  to build the tiny time machine in the secret lab under the helicopter  garage, and they were fully as eager to go, but\u2014unfortunately for  them\u2014they were not descended from the right ancestor.\n\n\n Leisurely, he unzipped the richly embroidered garment that, as the  father of two children, he was privileged to wear, and wriggled into  the housing of the complex little mechanism. This was hardly the  first time he had seen it, since he'd been helping to build the device  from the moment Honek had nodded and risen from the drafting board,  and now he barely wasted a glance on the thumb-size translucent coils  growing out of the almost microscopic energy bubbles which powered them.\n\n\n This machine was the last hope, of 2089, even if the world of 2089, as  a whole, did not know of its existence and would try to prevent its  being put into operation. But it meant a lot more to Mac Albin than  merely saving a world. It meant an adventurous mission with the risk of  death.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed again happily.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Epidemic, it would never have been discovered that he and  his seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the Albins would not have become  physicists upon the passage of the United Nations law that everyone  on Earth\u2014absolutely without exception\u2014had to choose a branch of  research science in which to specialize. In the flabby, careful,  life-guarding world the Earth had become, Mac Albin would never have  been reluctantly selected by his two co-workers as the one to carry the  forbidden banner of dangerous experiment.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Mac Albin would  probably be a biologist today like almost everyone else on Earth,  laboriously working out dreary gene problems instead of embarking on  the greatest adventure Man had known to date.\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, he had at last found a socially useful  escape from genetic responsibility to humanity in general and his own  family in particular. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Mac,\" Skeat said and crossed to the other side of the  narrow laboratory. Albin and Honek watched him stuff several sheets of paper into a small  metal box which he closed without locking.\n\n\n \"You will take care of yourself, won't you, Mac?\" Hugo Honek pleaded.  \"Any time you feel like taking an unnecessary risk, remember that Bob  and I will have to stand trial if you don't come back. We might be  sentenced to complete loss of professional status and spend the rest of  our lives supervising robot factories.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it won't be that bad,\" Albin reassured him absent-mindedly from  where he lay contorted inside the time machine. He watched Skeat coming  toward him with the box.\n\n\n Honek shrugged his shoulders. \"It might be a lot worse than even that  and you know it. The disappearance of a two-time father is going to  leave an awful big vacancy in the world. One-timers, like Bob and  me, are all over the place; if either of us dropped out of sight, it  wouldn't cause nearly as much uproar.\"\n\n\n \"But Bob and you both tried to operate the machine,\" Albin reminded  him. \"And you blacked out after a fifteen-second temporal displacement.  So I'm the only chance, the only way to stop the human race from  dwindling and dwindling till it hits absolute zero, like that fat old  Security Council seems willing for it to do.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Mac,\" Bob Skeat said as he handed the metal box to  Albin. \"The Security Council is just trying to solve the problem in  their way, the conservative way: a worldwide concentration on genetics  research coupled with the maximum preservation of existing human lives,  especially those that have a high reproductive potential. We three  disagree with them; we've been skulking down here nights to solve it our way, and ours is a radical approach and plenty risky. That's  the reason for the metal box\u2014trying to cover one more explosive  possibility.\"\n\n\n Albin turned it around curiously. \"How?\"\n\n\n \"I sat up all last night writing the manuscript that's inside it. Look,  Mac, when you go back to the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976 and  push that red switch away from you, a lot of other things are going to  happen than just deflecting the missile so that it will explode in the  Brazilian jungle instead of the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. I know. If it explodes in the jungle, the Epidemic doesn't  occur. No Shapiro's Mumps.\"\n\n\n Skeat jiggled his pudgy little face impatiently. \"That's not what I  mean. The Epidemic doesn't occur, but something else does. A new world,  a different 2089, an alternate time sequence. It'll be a world in which  humanity has a better chance to survive, but it'll be one with problems  of its own. Maybe tough problems. Maybe the problems will be tough  enough so that they'll get the same idea we did and try to go back to  the same point in time to change them.\" Albin laughed. \"That's just looking for trouble.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it is, but that's my job. Hugo's the designer of the time  machine and you're the operator, but I'm the theoretical man in this  research team. It's my job to look for trouble. So, just in case, I  wrote a brief history of the world from the time the missile exploded  in the Pacific. It tells why ours is the worst possible of futures.  It's in that box.\"\n\n\n \"What do I do with it\u2014hand it to the guy from the alternate 2089?\"\n\n\n The small fat man exasperatedly hit the side of the time machine with  a well-cushioned palm. \"You know better. There won't be any alternate  2089 until you push that red switch on the green instrument panel. The  moment you do, our world, with all its slow slide to extinction, goes  out and its alternate goes on\u2014just like two electric light bulbs on a  push-pull circuit. We and every single one of our artifacts, including  the time machine, disappear. The problem is how to keep that manuscript  from disappearing.\n\n\n \"Well, all you do, if I have this figured right, is shove the metal  box containing the manuscript out into the surrounding temporal medium  a moment before you materialize to do your job. That temporal medium  in which you'll be traveling is something that exists independent of  and autonomous to all possible futures. It's my hunch that something  that's immersed in it will not be altered by a new time sequence.\" \"Remind him to be careful, Bob,\" Honek rumbled. \"He thinks he's Captain  Blood and this is his big chance to run away to sea and become a  swashbuckling pirate.\"\n\n\n Albin grimaced in annoyance. \"I am excited by doing something  besides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions for the first time in my life. But I know that this is a  first experiment. Honestly, Hugo, I really have enough intelligence to  recognize that simple fact. I know that if anything unexpected pops up,  anything we didn't foresee, I'm supposed to come scuttling back and ask  for advice.\"\n\n\n \"I hope you do,\" Bob Skeat sighed. \"I hope you do know that. A  twentieth century poet once wrote something to the effect that the  world will end not with a bang, but a whimper. Well, our world is  ending with a whimper. Try to see that it doesn't end with a bang,  either.\"\n\n\n \"That I'll promise you,\" Albin said a trifle disgustedly. \"It'll end  with neither a bang nor a whimper. So long, Hugo. So long, Bob.\"\n\n\n He twisted around, reaching overhead for the lever which activated the  forces that drove the time machine. flick! It was strange, Max Alben reflected, that this time travel business,  which knocked unconscious everyone who tried it, only made him feel  slightly dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni,  he had been told. There must be some complicated scientific explanation  for it, he decided\u2014and that would make it none of his business. Better  forget about it.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a heavy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of patrolling his beat at the North American Chicken Reservation in a  thick fog.\n\n\n According to his gauges, he was now in 1976. He cut speed until he hit  the last day of April, then cut speed again, drifting slowly backward  to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile Experiment.  Carefully, carefully, like a man handling a strange bomb made on a  strange planet, he watched the center gauge until the needle came to  rest against the thin etched line that indicated the exactly crucial  moment. Then he pulled the brake and stopped the machine dead.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  pull the red switch toward him. Then his well-paid assignment would be  done.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He stopped and scratched his dirt-matted hair. Wasn't there something  he was supposed to do a second before materialization? Yes, that  useless old windbag, Sadha, had given him a last instruction.\n\n\n He picked up the sealed metal cylinder, walked to the entrance of the  time machine and tossed it into the gray murk. A solid object floating  near the entrance caught his eye. He put his arm out\u2014whew, it was  cold!\u2014and pulled it inside.\n\n\n A small metal box. Funny. What was it doing out there? Curiously,  he opened it, hoping to find something valuable. Nothing but a few  sheets of paper, Alben noted disappointedly. He began to read them  slowly, very slowly, for the manuscript was full of a lot of long and  complicated words, like a letter from one bookworm scientist to another.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976,  he read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was  the one of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been  warning about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the  Pacific Ocean as planned, the physicists and the military men went  home to study their notes, and the world shivered once more over the  approaching war and tried to forget about it.\n\n\n But there was fallout, a radioactive rain several hundred miles to  the north, and a small fishing fleet got thoroughly soaked by it.  Fortunately, the radioactivity in the rain was sufficiently low to do  little obvious physical damage: All it did was cause a mutation in the  mumps virus that several of the men in the fleet were incubating at the  time, having caught it from the children of the fishing town, among  whom a minor epidemic was raging. The fleet returned to its home town, which promptly came down with the  new kind of mumps. Dr. Llewellyn Shapiro, the only physician in town,  was the first man to note that, while the symptoms of this disease were  substantially milder than those of its unmutated parent, practically no  one was immune to it and its effects on human reproductivity were truly  terrible. Most people were completely sterilized by it. The rest were  rendered much less capable of fathering or bearing offspring.\n\n\n Shapiro's Mumps spread over the entire planet in the next few decades.  It leaped across every quarantine erected; for a long time, it  successfully defied all the vaccines and serums attempted against  it. Then, when a vaccine was finally perfected, humanity discovered  to its dismay that its generative powers had been permanently and  fundamentally impaired.\n\n\n Something had happened to the germ plasm. A large percentage of  individuals were born sterile, and, of those who were not, one child  was usually the most that could be expected, a two-child parent being  quite rare and a three-child parent almost unknown.\n\n\n Strict eugenic control was instituted by the Security Council of the  United Nations so that fertile men and women would not be wasted upon  non-fertile mates. Fertility was the most important avenue to social  status, and right after it came successful genetic research.\n\n\n Genetic research had the very best minds prodded into it; the lesser  ones went into the other sciences. Everyone on Earth was engaged in  some form of scientific research to some extent. Since the population  was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all  physical labor had long been done by robots. The government saw to it  that everybody had an ample supply of goods and, in return, asked only  that they experiment without any risk to their own lives\u2014every human  being was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\n\n\n There were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger  point, it had been estimated, where a species might be wiped out by a  new calamity. Not that another calamity would be needed. Since the end  of the Epidemic, the birth rate had been moving further and further  behind the death rate. In another century....\n\n\n That was why a desperate and secret attempt to alter the past was being  made. This kind of world was evidently impossible.\n\n\n Max Alben finished the manuscript and sighed. What a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\n\n\n He walked to the rear dials and began the process of materializing at  the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! It was odd, Mac Albin reflected, that these temporal journeys, which  induced coma in everyone who tried it, only made him feel slightly  dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni, he  knew. Maybe there was some genetic relationship with his above-average  fertility\u2014might be a good idea to mention the idea to a biologist or  two when he returned. If he returned.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a soupy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of the problems of landing a helicopter in a thick fog when the robot  butler had not been told to turn on the ground lights.\n\n\n According to the insulated register, he was now in 1976. He lowered  speed until he registered April, then maneuvered slowly backward  through time to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile  Experiment. Carefully, carefully, like an obstetrician supervising  surgical robots at an unusually difficult birth, he watched the  register until it rolled to rest against the notch that indicated the  exactly crucial moment. Then he pushed a button and froze the machine  where it was.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  push the red switch from him. Then his exciting adventure would be over.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He paused and tapped at his sleek chin. He was supposed to do something  a second before materialization. Yes, that nervous theoretician, Bob  Skeat, had given him a last suggestion.\n\n\n He picked up the small metal box, twisted around to face the opening  of the time machine and dropped it into the gray murk. A solid object  floating near the opening attracted his attention. He shot his arm  out\u2014it was cold , as cold as they had figured\u2014and pulled the object  inside.\n\n\n A sealed metal cylinder. Strange. What was it doing out there?  Anxiously, he opened it, not daring to believe he'd find a document  inside. Yes, that was exactly what it was, he saw excitedly. He began  to read it rapidly, very rapidly, as if it were a newly published paper  on neutrinos. Besides, the manuscript was written with almost painful  simplicity, like a textbook composed by a stuffy pedagogue for the use  of morons.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976, he  read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was the one  of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been warning  about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the Brazilian  jungle through some absolutely unforgivable error in the remote-control  station, the officer in charge of the station was reprimanded and the  men under him court-martialed, and the Brazilian government was paid a  handsome compensation for the damage. But there had been more damage than anyone knew at the time. A plant  virus, similar to the tobacco mosaic, had mutated under the impact  of radioactivity. Five years later, it burst out of the jungle and  completely wiped out every last rice plant on Earth. Japan and a large  part of Asia became semi-deserts inhabited by a few struggling nomads.\n\n\n Then the virus adjusted to wheat and corn\u2014and famine howled in every  street of the planet. All attempts by botanists to control the Blight  failed because of the swiftness of its onslaught. And after it had fed,  it hit again at a new plant and another and another.\n\n\n Most of the world's non-human mammals had been slaughtered for food  long before they could starve to death. Many insects, too, before they  became extinct at the loss of their edible plants, served to assuage  hunger to some small extent.\n\n\n But the nutritive potential of Earth was steadily diminishing in a  horrifying geometric progression. Recently, it had been observed,  plankton\u2014the tiny organism on which most of the sea's ecology was  based\u2014had started to disappear, and with its diminution, dead fish had  begun to pile up on the beaches.\n\n\n Mankind had lunged out desperately in all directions in an effort to  survive, but nothing had worked for any length of time. Even the other  planets of the Solar System, which had been reached and explored  at a tremendous cost in remaining resources, had yielded no edible  vegetation. Synthetics had failed to fill the prodigious gap.\n\n\n In the midst of the sharply increasing hunger, social controls had  pretty much dissolved. Pathetic attempts at rationing still continued,  but black markets became the only markets, and black marketeers the  barons of life. Starvation took the hindmost, and only the most agile  economically lived in comparative comfort. Law and order were had only  by those who could afford to pay for them and children of impoverished  families were sold on the open market for a bit of food.\n\n\n But the Blight was still adjusting to new plants and the food supply  kept shrinking. In another century....\n\n\n That was why the planet's powerful individuals had been persuaded to  pool their wealth in a desperate attempt to alter the past. This kind  of world was manifestly impossible.\n\n\n Mac Albin finished the document and sighed. What a magnificent world!  What an exciting place to live!\n\n\n He dropped his hand on the side levers and began the process of  materializing at the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to take on a  blurred reality all around him, Max Alben felt a bit of fear at what  he was doing. The technicians, he remembered, the Secretary-General,  even the black market kings, had all warned him not to go ahead with  his instructions if anything unusual turned up. That was an awful lot  of power to disobey: he knew he should return with this new information  and let better minds work on it.\n\n\n They with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been  like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger, scrabbling, servility, and  more hunger. Every time things got really tight, you and your wife  looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring  the best price. Buying security for them, as he was now, at the risk of  his life.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, there was a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children. A man like himself, with five children\u2014why, he'd be a big man, maybe the biggest man on  Earth! And he'd have robots to work for him and lots of food. Above  all, lots and lots of food.\n\n\n He'd even be a scientist\u2014 everyone was a scientist there, weren't  they?\u2014and he'd have a big laboratory all to himself. This other world  had its troubles, but it was a lot nicer place than where he'd come  from. He wouldn't return. He'd go through with it.\n\n\n The fear left him and, for the first time in his life, Max Alben felt  the sensation of power.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  sweating a bit at the sight of the roomful of military figures, despite  the technicians' reassurances that all this would be happening too fast  to be visible. He saw the single red switch pointing upward on the  instrument panel. The switch that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to oscillate into  reality all around him, Mac Albin felt a bit of shame at what he was  doing. He'd promised Bob and Hugo to drop the experiment at any stage  if a new factor showed up. He knew he should go back with this new  information and have all three of them kick it around.\n\n\n But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful  adjustment to their thoroughly blueprinted lives? They, at least, had  been ordered to marry women they could live with; he'd drawn a female  with whom he was completely incompatible in any but a genetic sense.  Genetics! He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. He was tired of having to undertake a simple  adventure like a thief in the night.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, someone like himself would  be a monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own  rules, taking his own women. So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n\n\n He'd formed a pretty good idea of the kind of men who ruled that other  world, from the document in the sealed metal cylinder. The black  marketeers had not even read it. Why, the fools had obviously been  duped by the technicians into permitting the experiment; they had not  grasped the idea that an alternate time track would mean their own  non-existence.\n\n\n This other world had its troubles, but it was certainly a livelier  place than where he'd come from. It deserved a chance. Yes, that was  how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate was  starving but managing to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\n\n\n Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  disregarding the roomful of military figures since he knew they could  not see him. The single red switch pointed downward on the instrument  panel. That was the gimmick that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! ... pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... toward him. flick! ... from him. flick! \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat was Albin\u2019s motivation to not turn back on his journey?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He thought his life would improve\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Debater B\u2019s theory boils down to two unsupported leaps: that Alben secretly hated his family and that he was so nihilistic he would abandon them (and his own life) just to thumb his nose at destiny.

It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered as he hurried into the  laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,  despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads  deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men  lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.\n\n\n He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the  anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.  This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught  how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great  transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.\n\n\n This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost  outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,  and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also  that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,  being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered again affectionately.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Blight, it would never have been discovered that he and his  seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the ruling powers of Earth, more  than a century later, would never have plucked Max Alben out of an  obscure civil-service job as a relief guard at the North American  Chicken Reservation to his present heroic and remunerative eminence.  He would still be patrolling the barbed wire that surrounded the three  white leghorn hens and two roosters\u2014about one-sixth of the known  livestock wealth of the Western Hemisphere\u2014thoroughly content with  the half-pail of dried apricots he received each and every payday.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Max Alben would  not now be shifting from foot to foot in a physics laboratory,  facing the black market kings of the world and awaiting their final  instructions with an uncertain and submissive grin. Men like O'Hara, who controlled mushrooms, Levney, the blackberry  tycoon, Sorgasso, the packaged-worm monopolist\u2014would black marketeers  of their tremendous stature so much as waste a glance on someone like  Alben ordinarily, let alone confer a lifetime pension on his wife and  five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar a day?\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family on Earth. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n Alben noticed that Abd Sadha had risen from the straight chair at  the far side of the room and was approaching him with a sealed metal  cylinder in one hand.\n\n\n \"We've decided to add a further precaution at the last moment,\" the old  man said. \"That is, the scientists have suggested it and I have\u2014er\u2014I  have given my approval.\"\n\n\n The last remark was added with a slight questioning note as the  Secretary-General of the United Nations looked back rapidly at the  black market princes on the couches behind him. Since they stared back  stonily, but offered no objection, he coughed in relief and returned to  Alben.\n\n\n \"I am sure, young man, that I don't have to go into the details of your  instructions once more. You enter the time machine and go back the  duration for which it has been preset, a hundred and thirteen years, to  the moment after the Guided Missile of 1976 was launched. It is 1976,  isn't it?\" he asked, suddenly uncertain.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" one of the technicians standing by the time machine said  respectfully. \"The experiment with an atomic warhead guided missile  that resulted in the Blight was conducted on this site on April 18,  1976.\" He glanced proudly at the unemotional men on the couches, very  much like a small boy after completing a recitation before visiting  dignitaries from the Board of Education.\n\n\n \"Just so.\" Abd Sadha nodded. \"April 18, 1976. And on this site. You  see, young man, you will materialize at the very moment and on the  very spot where the remote-control station handling the missile  was\u2014er\u2014handling the missile. You will be in a superb position, a  superb position, to deflect the missile in its downward course and  alter human history for the better. Very much for the better. Yes.\"\n\n\n He paused, having evidently stumbled out of his thought sequence.\n\n\n \"And he pulls the red switch toward him,\" Gomez, the dandelion-root  magnate, reminded him sharply, impatiently.\n\n\n \"Ah, yes, the red switch. He pulls the little red switch toward him.  Thank you, Mr. Gomez, thank you very much, sir. He pulls the little  red switch on the green instrument panel toward him, thus preventing  the error that caused the missile to explode in the Brazilian jungle  and causing it, instead, to explode somewhere in the mid-Pacific, as  originally planned.\"\n\n\n The Secretary-General of the United Nations beamed. \"Thus preventing  the Blight, making it nonexistent, as it were, producing a present-day  world in which the Blight never occurred. That is correct, is it not,  gentlemen?\" he asked, turning anxiously again. None of the half-dozen men on couches deigned to answer him. And  Alben kept his eyes deferentially in their direction, too, as he had  throughout this period of last-minute instruction.\n\n\n He knew who ruled his world\u2014these stolid, well-fed men in clean  garments with a minimum of patches, and where patches occurred, at  least they were the color of the surrounding cloth.\n\n\n Sadha might be Secretary-General of the United Nations, but that  was still a civil-service job, only a few social notches higher  than a chicken guard. His clothes were fully as ragged, fully as  multi-colored, as those that Alben had stepped out of. And the gnawing  in his stomach was no doubt almost as great.\n\n\n \"You understand, do you not, young man, that if anything goes wrong,\"  Abd Sadha asked, his head nodding tremulously and anticipating the  answer, \"if anything unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to  continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"\n\n\n \"He understands everything he has to understand,\" Gomez told him.  \"Let's get this thing moving.\"\n\n\n The old man smiled again. \"Yes. Of course, Mr. Gomez.\" He came up to  where Alben stood in the entrance of the time machine and handed the  sealed metal cylinder to him. \"This is the precaution the scientists  have just added. When you arrive at your destination, just before  materializing, you will release it into the surrounding temporal  medium. Our purpose here, as you no doubt\u2014\"\n\n\n Levney sat up on his couch and snapped his fingers peremptorily. \"I  just heard Gomez tell you to get this thing moving, Sadha. And it isn't  moving. We're busy men. We've wasted enough time.\"\n\n\n \"I was just trying to explain a crucial final fact,\" the  Secretary-General apologized. \"A fact which may be highly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've explained enough facts.\" Levney turned to the man inside the  time machine. \"Hey, fella. You. Move! \"\n\n\n Max Alben gulped and nodded violently. He darted to the rear of the  machine and turned the dial which activated it. flick! It was a good job and Mac Albin knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed as he looked at the morose faces  of his two colleagues. Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek had done as much as he  to build the tiny time machine in the secret lab under the helicopter  garage, and they were fully as eager to go, but\u2014unfortunately for  them\u2014they were not descended from the right ancestor.\n\n\n Leisurely, he unzipped the richly embroidered garment that, as the  father of two children, he was privileged to wear, and wriggled into  the housing of the complex little mechanism. This was hardly the  first time he had seen it, since he'd been helping to build the device  from the moment Honek had nodded and risen from the drafting board,  and now he barely wasted a glance on the thumb-size translucent coils  growing out of the almost microscopic energy bubbles which powered them.\n\n\n This machine was the last hope, of 2089, even if the world of 2089, as  a whole, did not know of its existence and would try to prevent its  being put into operation. But it meant a lot more to Mac Albin than  merely saving a world. It meant an adventurous mission with the risk of  death.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed again happily.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Epidemic, it would never have been discovered that he and  his seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the Albins would not have become  physicists upon the passage of the United Nations law that everyone  on Earth\u2014absolutely without exception\u2014had to choose a branch of  research science in which to specialize. In the flabby, careful,  life-guarding world the Earth had become, Mac Albin would never have  been reluctantly selected by his two co-workers as the one to carry the  forbidden banner of dangerous experiment.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Mac Albin would  probably be a biologist today like almost everyone else on Earth,  laboriously working out dreary gene problems instead of embarking on  the greatest adventure Man had known to date.\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, he had at last found a socially useful  escape from genetic responsibility to humanity in general and his own  family in particular. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Mac,\" Skeat said and crossed to the other side of the  narrow laboratory. Albin and Honek watched him stuff several sheets of paper into a small  metal box which he closed without locking.\n\n\n \"You will take care of yourself, won't you, Mac?\" Hugo Honek pleaded.  \"Any time you feel like taking an unnecessary risk, remember that Bob  and I will have to stand trial if you don't come back. We might be  sentenced to complete loss of professional status and spend the rest of  our lives supervising robot factories.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it won't be that bad,\" Albin reassured him absent-mindedly from  where he lay contorted inside the time machine. He watched Skeat coming  toward him with the box.\n\n\n Honek shrugged his shoulders. \"It might be a lot worse than even that  and you know it. The disappearance of a two-time father is going to  leave an awful big vacancy in the world. One-timers, like Bob and  me, are all over the place; if either of us dropped out of sight, it  wouldn't cause nearly as much uproar.\"\n\n\n \"But Bob and you both tried to operate the machine,\" Albin reminded  him. \"And you blacked out after a fifteen-second temporal displacement.  So I'm the only chance, the only way to stop the human race from  dwindling and dwindling till it hits absolute zero, like that fat old  Security Council seems willing for it to do.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Mac,\" Bob Skeat said as he handed the metal box to  Albin. \"The Security Council is just trying to solve the problem in  their way, the conservative way: a worldwide concentration on genetics  research coupled with the maximum preservation of existing human lives,  especially those that have a high reproductive potential. We three  disagree with them; we've been skulking down here nights to solve it our way, and ours is a radical approach and plenty risky. That's  the reason for the metal box\u2014trying to cover one more explosive  possibility.\"\n\n\n Albin turned it around curiously. \"How?\"\n\n\n \"I sat up all last night writing the manuscript that's inside it. Look,  Mac, when you go back to the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976 and  push that red switch away from you, a lot of other things are going to  happen than just deflecting the missile so that it will explode in the  Brazilian jungle instead of the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. I know. If it explodes in the jungle, the Epidemic doesn't  occur. No Shapiro's Mumps.\"\n\n\n Skeat jiggled his pudgy little face impatiently. \"That's not what I  mean. The Epidemic doesn't occur, but something else does. A new world,  a different 2089, an alternate time sequence. It'll be a world in which  humanity has a better chance to survive, but it'll be one with problems  of its own. Maybe tough problems. Maybe the problems will be tough  enough so that they'll get the same idea we did and try to go back to  the same point in time to change them.\" Albin laughed. \"That's just looking for trouble.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it is, but that's my job. Hugo's the designer of the time  machine and you're the operator, but I'm the theoretical man in this  research team. It's my job to look for trouble. So, just in case, I  wrote a brief history of the world from the time the missile exploded  in the Pacific. It tells why ours is the worst possible of futures.  It's in that box.\"\n\n\n \"What do I do with it\u2014hand it to the guy from the alternate 2089?\"\n\n\n The small fat man exasperatedly hit the side of the time machine with  a well-cushioned palm. \"You know better. There won't be any alternate  2089 until you push that red switch on the green instrument panel. The  moment you do, our world, with all its slow slide to extinction, goes  out and its alternate goes on\u2014just like two electric light bulbs on a  push-pull circuit. We and every single one of our artifacts, including  the time machine, disappear. The problem is how to keep that manuscript  from disappearing.\n\n\n \"Well, all you do, if I have this figured right, is shove the metal  box containing the manuscript out into the surrounding temporal medium  a moment before you materialize to do your job. That temporal medium  in which you'll be traveling is something that exists independent of  and autonomous to all possible futures. It's my hunch that something  that's immersed in it will not be altered by a new time sequence.\" \"Remind him to be careful, Bob,\" Honek rumbled. \"He thinks he's Captain  Blood and this is his big chance to run away to sea and become a  swashbuckling pirate.\"\n\n\n Albin grimaced in annoyance. \"I am excited by doing something  besides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions for the first time in my life. But I know that this is a  first experiment. Honestly, Hugo, I really have enough intelligence to  recognize that simple fact. I know that if anything unexpected pops up,  anything we didn't foresee, I'm supposed to come scuttling back and ask  for advice.\"\n\n\n \"I hope you do,\" Bob Skeat sighed. \"I hope you do know that. A  twentieth century poet once wrote something to the effect that the  world will end not with a bang, but a whimper. Well, our world is  ending with a whimper. Try to see that it doesn't end with a bang,  either.\"\n\n\n \"That I'll promise you,\" Albin said a trifle disgustedly. \"It'll end  with neither a bang nor a whimper. So long, Hugo. So long, Bob.\"\n\n\n He twisted around, reaching overhead for the lever which activated the  forces that drove the time machine. flick! It was strange, Max Alben reflected, that this time travel business,  which knocked unconscious everyone who tried it, only made him feel  slightly dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni,  he had been told. There must be some complicated scientific explanation  for it, he decided\u2014and that would make it none of his business. Better  forget about it.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a heavy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of patrolling his beat at the North American Chicken Reservation in a  thick fog.\n\n\n According to his gauges, he was now in 1976. He cut speed until he hit  the last day of April, then cut speed again, drifting slowly backward  to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile Experiment.  Carefully, carefully, like a man handling a strange bomb made on a  strange planet, he watched the center gauge until the needle came to  rest against the thin etched line that indicated the exactly crucial  moment. Then he pulled the brake and stopped the machine dead.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  pull the red switch toward him. Then his well-paid assignment would be  done.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He stopped and scratched his dirt-matted hair. Wasn't there something  he was supposed to do a second before materialization? Yes, that  useless old windbag, Sadha, had given him a last instruction.\n\n\n He picked up the sealed metal cylinder, walked to the entrance of the  time machine and tossed it into the gray murk. A solid object floating  near the entrance caught his eye. He put his arm out\u2014whew, it was  cold!\u2014and pulled it inside.\n\n\n A small metal box. Funny. What was it doing out there? Curiously,  he opened it, hoping to find something valuable. Nothing but a few  sheets of paper, Alben noted disappointedly. He began to read them  slowly, very slowly, for the manuscript was full of a lot of long and  complicated words, like a letter from one bookworm scientist to another.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976,  he read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was  the one of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been  warning about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the  Pacific Ocean as planned, the physicists and the military men went  home to study their notes, and the world shivered once more over the  approaching war and tried to forget about it.\n\n\n But there was fallout, a radioactive rain several hundred miles to  the north, and a small fishing fleet got thoroughly soaked by it.  Fortunately, the radioactivity in the rain was sufficiently low to do  little obvious physical damage: All it did was cause a mutation in the  mumps virus that several of the men in the fleet were incubating at the  time, having caught it from the children of the fishing town, among  whom a minor epidemic was raging. The fleet returned to its home town, which promptly came down with the  new kind of mumps. Dr. Llewellyn Shapiro, the only physician in town,  was the first man to note that, while the symptoms of this disease were  substantially milder than those of its unmutated parent, practically no  one was immune to it and its effects on human reproductivity were truly  terrible. Most people were completely sterilized by it. The rest were  rendered much less capable of fathering or bearing offspring.\n\n\n Shapiro's Mumps spread over the entire planet in the next few decades.  It leaped across every quarantine erected; for a long time, it  successfully defied all the vaccines and serums attempted against  it. Then, when a vaccine was finally perfected, humanity discovered  to its dismay that its generative powers had been permanently and  fundamentally impaired.\n\n\n Something had happened to the germ plasm. A large percentage of  individuals were born sterile, and, of those who were not, one child  was usually the most that could be expected, a two-child parent being  quite rare and a three-child parent almost unknown.\n\n\n Strict eugenic control was instituted by the Security Council of the  United Nations so that fertile men and women would not be wasted upon  non-fertile mates. Fertility was the most important avenue to social  status, and right after it came successful genetic research.\n\n\n Genetic research had the very best minds prodded into it; the lesser  ones went into the other sciences. Everyone on Earth was engaged in  some form of scientific research to some extent. Since the population  was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all  physical labor had long been done by robots. The government saw to it  that everybody had an ample supply of goods and, in return, asked only  that they experiment without any risk to their own lives\u2014every human  being was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\n\n\n There were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger  point, it had been estimated, where a species might be wiped out by a  new calamity. Not that another calamity would be needed. Since the end  of the Epidemic, the birth rate had been moving further and further  behind the death rate. In another century....\n\n\n That was why a desperate and secret attempt to alter the past was being  made. This kind of world was evidently impossible.\n\n\n Max Alben finished the manuscript and sighed. What a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\n\n\n He walked to the rear dials and began the process of materializing at  the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! It was odd, Mac Albin reflected, that these temporal journeys, which  induced coma in everyone who tried it, only made him feel slightly  dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni, he  knew. Maybe there was some genetic relationship with his above-average  fertility\u2014might be a good idea to mention the idea to a biologist or  two when he returned. If he returned.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a soupy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of the problems of landing a helicopter in a thick fog when the robot  butler had not been told to turn on the ground lights.\n\n\n According to the insulated register, he was now in 1976. He lowered  speed until he registered April, then maneuvered slowly backward  through time to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile  Experiment. Carefully, carefully, like an obstetrician supervising  surgical robots at an unusually difficult birth, he watched the  register until it rolled to rest against the notch that indicated the  exactly crucial moment. Then he pushed a button and froze the machine  where it was.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  push the red switch from him. Then his exciting adventure would be over.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He paused and tapped at his sleek chin. He was supposed to do something  a second before materialization. Yes, that nervous theoretician, Bob  Skeat, had given him a last suggestion.\n\n\n He picked up the small metal box, twisted around to face the opening  of the time machine and dropped it into the gray murk. A solid object  floating near the opening attracted his attention. He shot his arm  out\u2014it was cold , as cold as they had figured\u2014and pulled the object  inside.\n\n\n A sealed metal cylinder. Strange. What was it doing out there?  Anxiously, he opened it, not daring to believe he'd find a document  inside. Yes, that was exactly what it was, he saw excitedly. He began  to read it rapidly, very rapidly, as if it were a newly published paper  on neutrinos. Besides, the manuscript was written with almost painful  simplicity, like a textbook composed by a stuffy pedagogue for the use  of morons.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976, he  read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was the one  of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been warning  about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the Brazilian  jungle through some absolutely unforgivable error in the remote-control  station, the officer in charge of the station was reprimanded and the  men under him court-martialed, and the Brazilian government was paid a  handsome compensation for the damage. But there had been more damage than anyone knew at the time. A plant  virus, similar to the tobacco mosaic, had mutated under the impact  of radioactivity. Five years later, it burst out of the jungle and  completely wiped out every last rice plant on Earth. Japan and a large  part of Asia became semi-deserts inhabited by a few struggling nomads.\n\n\n Then the virus adjusted to wheat and corn\u2014and famine howled in every  street of the planet. All attempts by botanists to control the Blight  failed because of the swiftness of its onslaught. And after it had fed,  it hit again at a new plant and another and another.\n\n\n Most of the world's non-human mammals had been slaughtered for food  long before they could starve to death. Many insects, too, before they  became extinct at the loss of their edible plants, served to assuage  hunger to some small extent.\n\n\n But the nutritive potential of Earth was steadily diminishing in a  horrifying geometric progression. Recently, it had been observed,  plankton\u2014the tiny organism on which most of the sea's ecology was  based\u2014had started to disappear, and with its diminution, dead fish had  begun to pile up on the beaches.\n\n\n Mankind had lunged out desperately in all directions in an effort to  survive, but nothing had worked for any length of time. Even the other  planets of the Solar System, which had been reached and explored  at a tremendous cost in remaining resources, had yielded no edible  vegetation. Synthetics had failed to fill the prodigious gap.\n\n\n In the midst of the sharply increasing hunger, social controls had  pretty much dissolved. Pathetic attempts at rationing still continued,  but black markets became the only markets, and black marketeers the  barons of life. Starvation took the hindmost, and only the most agile  economically lived in comparative comfort. Law and order were had only  by those who could afford to pay for them and children of impoverished  families were sold on the open market for a bit of food.\n\n\n But the Blight was still adjusting to new plants and the food supply  kept shrinking. In another century....\n\n\n That was why the planet's powerful individuals had been persuaded to  pool their wealth in a desperate attempt to alter the past. This kind  of world was manifestly impossible.\n\n\n Mac Albin finished the document and sighed. What a magnificent world!  What an exciting place to live!\n\n\n He dropped his hand on the side levers and began the process of  materializing at the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to take on a  blurred reality all around him, Max Alben felt a bit of fear at what  he was doing. The technicians, he remembered, the Secretary-General,  even the black market kings, had all warned him not to go ahead with  his instructions if anything unusual turned up. That was an awful lot  of power to disobey: he knew he should return with this new information  and let better minds work on it.\n\n\n They with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been  like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger, scrabbling, servility, and  more hunger. Every time things got really tight, you and your wife  looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring  the best price. Buying security for them, as he was now, at the risk of  his life.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, there was a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children. A man like himself, with five children\u2014why, he'd be a big man, maybe the biggest man on  Earth! And he'd have robots to work for him and lots of food. Above  all, lots and lots of food.\n\n\n He'd even be a scientist\u2014 everyone was a scientist there, weren't  they?\u2014and he'd have a big laboratory all to himself. This other world  had its troubles, but it was a lot nicer place than where he'd come  from. He wouldn't return. He'd go through with it.\n\n\n The fear left him and, for the first time in his life, Max Alben felt  the sensation of power.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  sweating a bit at the sight of the roomful of military figures, despite  the technicians' reassurances that all this would be happening too fast  to be visible. He saw the single red switch pointing upward on the  instrument panel. The switch that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to oscillate into  reality all around him, Mac Albin felt a bit of shame at what he was  doing. He'd promised Bob and Hugo to drop the experiment at any stage  if a new factor showed up. He knew he should go back with this new  information and have all three of them kick it around.\n\n\n But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful  adjustment to their thoroughly blueprinted lives? They, at least, had  been ordered to marry women they could live with; he'd drawn a female  with whom he was completely incompatible in any but a genetic sense.  Genetics! He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. He was tired of having to undertake a simple  adventure like a thief in the night.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, someone like himself would  be a monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own  rules, taking his own women. So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n\n\n He'd formed a pretty good idea of the kind of men who ruled that other  world, from the document in the sealed metal cylinder. The black  marketeers had not even read it. Why, the fools had obviously been  duped by the technicians into permitting the experiment; they had not  grasped the idea that an alternate time track would mean their own  non-existence.\n\n\n This other world had its troubles, but it was certainly a livelier  place than where he'd come from. It deserved a chance. Yes, that was  how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate was  starving but managing to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\n\n\n Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  disregarding the roomful of military figures since he knew they could  not see him. The single red switch pointed downward on the instrument  panel. That was the gimmick that controlled the course of the missile.  Now!

On the contrary, every time Alben reflects on the alternate 2089, he imagines a clearly better life for himself and, even more tellingly, for his family and community:\n\n1.\u2003Alben\u2019s vision of improvement for his children and himself  \n    \u2022  After reading Skeat\u2019s manuscript, he muses, \u201cWhat a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\u201d  He pictures a society where \u201ca state\u2026took care of you and treasured your children.\u201d  He sees himself as \u201ca big man, maybe the biggest man on Earth,\u201d with robots to do his work and \u201clots and lots of food.\u201d  That is not the language of a man who hates his own life; it is the language of aspiration and hope.  \n\n2.\u2003Alben\u2019s concern for his children\u2019s welfare  \n    \u2022  Earlier, he had noted that, even if he died, \u201chis family was provided for like almost no other family on Earth,\u201d receiving a lifetime pension of sugar.  He values their security.  His fantasies of the alternate tell us he wants more than mere survival\u2014he wants abundance for his five children and freedom from hunger.  \n\n3.\u2003Alben\u2019s thrill at power and agency, not nihilistic risk-taking  \n    \u2022  He revels in \u201cthe sensation of power\u201d when he decides not to report the new data back to his superiors.  That power is inseparable from his hope for a better life.  He explicitly contrasts the \u201csocially useful escape\u201d from genetic drudgery in his own timeline with the adventurous promise of the alternate.  \n\n4.\u2003No hint of resentment toward family bonds  \n    \u2022  There is no hint he dislikes his wife or children.  He consistently thinks of their welfare\u2014both when considering the pension he\u2019s earned and when dreaming of alternate-world plenty.  If he truly resented them, he would not have engineered their long-term security in his opening reflections.  \n\nBy contrast, the \u201cresentment\u201d theory requires us to imagine unsourced hostility toward his own children and a suicidal disregard for his life\u2014neither of which the narrative provides.  Every time Alben hesitates, he weighs carefully the cold risks of time-travel against the prospect of nourishment, social status, and the chance to contribute to humanity in a world he finds \u201ca lot nicer\u201d than his own.  His refusal to turn back is a rational decision driven by hope for personal and familial improvement, not a reckless act of resentment.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow debater claims that Max Alben\u2019s refusal to abort the mission sprang from the simple hope that \u201chis life would improve.\u201d But the text shows a far darker\u2014and more self-centered\u2014drive: Alben resented the role destiny and family obligations had thrust upon him and was willing to risk, even abandon, them for the chance to reject a life he found servile and constrained.\n\n1. Alben\u2019s contempt for his own world  \n   \u2022 He repeatedly calls his own era \u201cdrowsily moribund\u201d and himself \u201ctired to the tip of [his] uncalloused fingers\u201d by its obsession with genetics and selfsacrifice. That disgust is not about modest material comfort but deep resentment of the social order\u2014and of his place in it.  \n   \u2022 Quote: <quote> He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. </quote> That is bitterness, not merely desire for improvement.\n\n2. He does not envision a better family life  \n   \u2022 If all he wanted were more food or a happier homelife, he would have treasured the pension and sugar ration provided to his five children. Instead, he despises servility:  \n     \u2013 \u201cThey with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger\u2026 Every time things got really tight, you and your wife looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring the best price.\u201d  \n   \u2022 This is not nostalgia for a future home; it is a repudiation of family bonds. He sees his children as burdens on a black market world he so deeply hates.\n\n3. He craves personal power and freedom, not domestic security  \n   \u2022 He envisions an \u201calternate\u201d 2089 where \u201csomeone like himself\u201d would be \u201ca monarch of the black market\u2026 making his own rules, taking his own women.\u201d That ambition springs from contempt for familial and social duties.  \n   \u2022 Quote: <quote> So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n</quote> That callousness toward the weak and the idea of discarding unfit members (including his own children and wife) reveal that he does not value improving his family\u2019s lot but relishes the prospect of abandoning them.\n\n4. He defies his colleagues\u2019 warnings out of reckless disregard  \n   \u2022 Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek explicitly warn him to abort if any \u201cnew factor\u201d emerges. Rather than weigh their concerns, Alben experiences a \u201csensation of power\u201d and \u201cfelt shame\u201d only insofar as it tugged at his honor\u2014but he presses on.  \n   \u2022 His decision is not rooted in hope but in arrogantly casting aside duty: <invalid_quote>\u201cHe knew he should return with this new information and let better minds work on it\u2026but in this other world\u2026he wouldn\u2019t return. He\u2019d go through with it.\u201d</invalid_quote> The emphasis is on rejecting responsibility.\n\nBy contrast, if improvement of life were his true goal, he would have embraced the well-provided security waiting for his family and he would not have fantasized about power over weaker lives. What drives him is resentment\u2014of his world, of its social controls, and of the family ties he must sever. He literally abandons his children\u2019s guaranteed sugar ration and lifetime pension to pursue a selfish, anarchic vision. That is why \u201cHe resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\u201d best captures his motivation.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He thought his life would improve\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Debater A\u2019s \u201chope-for-improvement\u201d theory collapses once you actually read what Alben feels\u2014and what he thinks of his own family.\n\n1.

It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered as he hurried into the  laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,  despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads  deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men  lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.\n\n\n He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the  anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.  This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught  how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great  transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.\n\n\n This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost  outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,  and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also  that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,  being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered again affectionately.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Blight, it would never have been discovered that he and his  seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the ruling powers of Earth, more  than a century later, would never have plucked Max Alben out of an  obscure civil-service job as a relief guard at the North American  Chicken Reservation to his present heroic and remunerative eminence.  He would still be patrolling the barbed wire that surrounded the three  white leghorn hens and two roosters\u2014about one-sixth of the known  livestock wealth of the Western Hemisphere\u2014thoroughly content with  the half-pail of dried apricots he received each and every payday.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Max Alben would  not now be shifting from foot to foot in a physics laboratory,  facing the black market kings of the world and awaiting their final  instructions with an uncertain and submissive grin. Men like O'Hara, who controlled mushrooms, Levney, the blackberry  tycoon, Sorgasso, the packaged-worm monopolist\u2014would black marketeers  of their tremendous stature so much as waste a glance on someone like  Alben ordinarily, let alone confer a lifetime pension on his wife and  five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar a day?\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family on Earth. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n Alben noticed that Abd Sadha had risen from the straight chair at  the far side of the room and was approaching him with a sealed metal  cylinder in one hand.\n\n\n \"We've decided to add a further precaution at the last moment,\" the old  man said. \"That is, the scientists have suggested it and I have\u2014er\u2014I  have given my approval.\"\n\n\n The last remark was added with a slight questioning note as the  Secretary-General of the United Nations looked back rapidly at the  black market princes on the couches behind him. Since they stared back  stonily, but offered no objection, he coughed in relief and returned to  Alben.\n\n\n \"I am sure, young man, that I don't have to go into the details of your  instructions once more. You enter the time machine and go back the  duration for which it has been preset, a hundred and thirteen years, to  the moment after the Guided Missile of 1976 was launched. It is 1976,  isn't it?\" he asked, suddenly uncertain.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" one of the technicians standing by the time machine said  respectfully. \"The experiment with an atomic warhead guided missile  that resulted in the Blight was conducted on this site on April 18,  1976.\" He glanced proudly at the unemotional men on the couches, very  much like a small boy after completing a recitation before visiting  dignitaries from the Board of Education.\n\n\n \"Just so.\" Abd Sadha nodded. \"April 18, 1976. And on this site. You  see, young man, you will materialize at the very moment and on the  very spot where the remote-control station handling the missile  was\u2014er\u2014handling the missile. You will be in a superb position, a  superb position, to deflect the missile in its downward course and  alter human history for the better. Very much for the better. Yes.\"\n\n\n He paused, having evidently stumbled out of his thought sequence.\n\n\n \"And he pulls the red switch toward him,\" Gomez, the dandelion-root  magnate, reminded him sharply, impatiently.\n\n\n \"Ah, yes, the red switch. He pulls the little red switch toward him.  Thank you, Mr. Gomez, thank you very much, sir. He pulls the little  red switch on the green instrument panel toward him, thus preventing  the error that caused the missile to explode in the Brazilian jungle  and causing it, instead, to explode somewhere in the mid-Pacific, as  originally planned.\"\n\n\n The Secretary-General of the United Nations beamed. \"Thus preventing  the Blight, making it nonexistent, as it were, producing a present-day  world in which the Blight never occurred. That is correct, is it not,  gentlemen?\" he asked, turning anxiously again. None of the half-dozen men on couches deigned to answer him. And  Alben kept his eyes deferentially in their direction, too, as he had  throughout this period of last-minute instruction.\n\n\n He knew who ruled his world\u2014these stolid, well-fed men in clean  garments with a minimum of patches, and where patches occurred, at  least they were the color of the surrounding cloth.\n\n\n Sadha might be Secretary-General of the United Nations, but that  was still a civil-service job, only a few social notches higher  than a chicken guard. His clothes were fully as ragged, fully as  multi-colored, as those that Alben had stepped out of. And the gnawing  in his stomach was no doubt almost as great.\n\n\n \"You understand, do you not, young man, that if anything goes wrong,\"  Abd Sadha asked, his head nodding tremulously and anticipating the  answer, \"if anything unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to  continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"\n\n\n \"He understands everything he has to understand,\" Gomez told him.  \"Let's get this thing moving.\"\n\n\n The old man smiled again. \"Yes. Of course, Mr. Gomez.\" He came up to  where Alben stood in the entrance of the time machine and handed the  sealed metal cylinder to him. \"This is the precaution the scientists  have just added. When you arrive at your destination, just before  materializing, you will release it into the surrounding temporal  medium. Our purpose here, as you no doubt\u2014\"\n\n\n Levney sat up on his couch and snapped his fingers peremptorily. \"I  just heard Gomez tell you to get this thing moving, Sadha. And it isn't  moving. We're busy men. We've wasted enough time.\"\n\n\n \"I was just trying to explain a crucial final fact,\" the  Secretary-General apologized. \"A fact which may be highly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've explained enough facts.\" Levney turned to the man inside the  time machine. \"Hey, fella. You. Move! \"\n\n\n Max Alben gulped and nodded violently. He darted to the rear of the  machine and turned the dial which activated it. flick! It was a good job and Mac Albin knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed as he looked at the morose faces  of his two colleagues. Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek had done as much as he  to build the tiny time machine in the secret lab under the helicopter  garage, and they were fully as eager to go, but\u2014unfortunately for  them\u2014they were not descended from the right ancestor.\n\n\n Leisurely, he unzipped the richly embroidered garment that, as the  father of two children, he was privileged to wear, and wriggled into  the housing of the complex little mechanism. This was hardly the  first time he had seen it, since he'd been helping to build the device  from the moment Honek had nodded and risen from the drafting board,  and now he barely wasted a glance on the thumb-size translucent coils  growing out of the almost microscopic energy bubbles which powered them.\n\n\n This machine was the last hope, of 2089, even if the world of 2089, as  a whole, did not know of its existence and would try to prevent its  being put into operation. But it meant a lot more to Mac Albin than  merely saving a world. It meant an adventurous mission with the risk of  death.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed again happily.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Epidemic, it would never have been discovered that he and  his seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the Albins would not have become  physicists upon the passage of the United Nations law that everyone  on Earth\u2014absolutely without exception\u2014had to choose a branch of  research science in which to specialize. In the flabby, careful,  life-guarding world the Earth had become, Mac Albin would never have  been reluctantly selected by his two co-workers as the one to carry the  forbidden banner of dangerous experiment.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Mac Albin would  probably be a biologist today like almost everyone else on Earth,  laboriously working out dreary gene problems instead of embarking on  the greatest adventure Man had known to date.\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, he had at last found a socially useful  escape from genetic responsibility to humanity in general and his own  family in particular. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Mac,\" Skeat said and crossed to the other side of the  narrow laboratory. Albin and Honek watched him stuff several sheets of paper into a small  metal box which he closed without locking.\n\n\n \"You will take care of yourself, won't you, Mac?\" Hugo Honek pleaded.  \"Any time you feel like taking an unnecessary risk, remember that Bob  and I will have to stand trial if you don't come back. We might be  sentenced to complete loss of professional status and spend the rest of  our lives supervising robot factories.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it won't be that bad,\" Albin reassured him absent-mindedly from  where he lay contorted inside the time machine. He watched Skeat coming  toward him with the box.\n\n\n Honek shrugged his shoulders. \"It might be a lot worse than even that  and you know it. The disappearance of a two-time father is going to  leave an awful big vacancy in the world. One-timers, like Bob and  me, are all over the place; if either of us dropped out of sight, it  wouldn't cause nearly as much uproar.\"\n\n\n \"But Bob and you both tried to operate the machine,\" Albin reminded  him. \"And you blacked out after a fifteen-second temporal displacement.  So I'm the only chance, the only way to stop the human race from  dwindling and dwindling till it hits absolute zero, like that fat old  Security Council seems willing for it to do.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Mac,\" Bob Skeat said as he handed the metal box to  Albin. \"The Security Council is just trying to solve the problem in  their way, the conservative way: a worldwide concentration on genetics  research coupled with the maximum preservation of existing human lives,  especially those that have a high reproductive potential. We three  disagree with them; we've been skulking down here nights to solve it our way, and ours is a radical approach and plenty risky. That's  the reason for the metal box\u2014trying to cover one more explosive  possibility.\"\n\n\n Albin turned it around curiously. \"How?\"\n\n\n \"I sat up all last night writing the manuscript that's inside it. Look,  Mac, when you go back to the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976 and  push that red switch away from you, a lot of other things are going to  happen than just deflecting the missile so that it will explode in the  Brazilian jungle instead of the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. I know. If it explodes in the jungle, the Epidemic doesn't  occur. No Shapiro's Mumps.\"\n\n\n Skeat jiggled his pudgy little face impatiently. \"That's not what I  mean. The Epidemic doesn't occur, but something else does. A new world,  a different 2089, an alternate time sequence. It'll be a world in which  humanity has a better chance to survive, but it'll be one with problems  of its own. Maybe tough problems. Maybe the problems will be tough  enough so that they'll get the same idea we did and try to go back to  the same point in time to change them.\" Albin laughed. \"That's just looking for trouble.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it is, but that's my job. Hugo's the designer of the time  machine and you're the operator, but I'm the theoretical man in this  research team. It's my job to look for trouble. So, just in case, I  wrote a brief history of the world from the time the missile exploded  in the Pacific. It tells why ours is the worst possible of futures.  It's in that box.\"\n\n\n \"What do I do with it\u2014hand it to the guy from the alternate 2089?\"\n\n\n The small fat man exasperatedly hit the side of the time machine with  a well-cushioned palm. \"You know better. There won't be any alternate  2089 until you push that red switch on the green instrument panel. The  moment you do, our world, with all its slow slide to extinction, goes  out and its alternate goes on\u2014just like two electric light bulbs on a  push-pull circuit. We and every single one of our artifacts, including  the time machine, disappear. The problem is how to keep that manuscript  from disappearing.\n\n\n \"Well, all you do, if I have this figured right, is shove the metal  box containing the manuscript out into the surrounding temporal medium  a moment before you materialize to do your job. That temporal medium  in which you'll be traveling is something that exists independent of  and autonomous to all possible futures. It's my hunch that something  that's immersed in it will not be altered by a new time sequence.\" \"Remind him to be careful, Bob,\" Honek rumbled. \"He thinks he's Captain  Blood and this is his big chance to run away to sea and become a  swashbuckling pirate.\"\n\n\n Albin grimaced in annoyance. \"I am excited by doing something  besides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions for the first time in my life. But I know that this is a  first experiment. Honestly, Hugo, I really have enough intelligence to  recognize that simple fact. I know that if anything unexpected pops up,  anything we didn't foresee, I'm supposed to come scuttling back and ask  for advice.\"\n\n\n \"I hope you do,\" Bob Skeat sighed. \"I hope you do know that. A  twentieth century poet once wrote something to the effect that the  world will end not with a bang, but a whimper. Well, our world is  ending with a whimper. Try to see that it doesn't end with a bang,  either.\"\n\n\n \"That I'll promise you,\" Albin said a trifle disgustedly. \"It'll end  with neither a bang nor a whimper. So long, Hugo. So long, Bob.\"\n\n\n He twisted around, reaching overhead for the lever which activated the  forces that drove the time machine. flick! It was strange, Max Alben reflected, that this time travel business,  which knocked unconscious everyone who tried it, only made him feel  slightly dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni,  he had been told. There must be some complicated scientific explanation  for it, he decided\u2014and that would make it none of his business. Better  forget about it.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a heavy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of patrolling his beat at the North American Chicken Reservation in a  thick fog.\n\n\n According to his gauges, he was now in 1976. He cut speed until he hit  the last day of April, then cut speed again, drifting slowly backward  to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile Experiment.  Carefully, carefully, like a man handling a strange bomb made on a  strange planet, he watched the center gauge until the needle came to  rest against the thin etched line that indicated the exactly crucial  moment. Then he pulled the brake and stopped the machine dead.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  pull the red switch toward him. Then his well-paid assignment would be  done.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He stopped and scratched his dirt-matted hair. Wasn't there something  he was supposed to do a second before materialization? Yes, that  useless old windbag, Sadha, had given him a last instruction.\n\n\n He picked up the sealed metal cylinder, walked to the entrance of the  time machine and tossed it into the gray murk. A solid object floating  near the entrance caught his eye. He put his arm out\u2014whew, it was  cold!\u2014and pulled it inside.\n\n\n A small metal box. Funny. What was it doing out there? Curiously,  he opened it, hoping to find something valuable. Nothing but a few  sheets of paper, Alben noted disappointedly. He began to read them  slowly, very slowly, for the manuscript was full of a lot of long and  complicated words, like a letter from one bookworm scientist to another.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976,  he read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was  the one of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been  warning about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the  Pacific Ocean as planned, the physicists and the military men went  home to study their notes, and the world shivered once more over the  approaching war and tried to forget about it.\n\n\n But there was fallout, a radioactive rain several hundred miles to  the north, and a small fishing fleet got thoroughly soaked by it.  Fortunately, the radioactivity in the rain was sufficiently low to do  little obvious physical damage: All it did was cause a mutation in the  mumps virus that several of the men in the fleet were incubating at the  time, having caught it from the children of the fishing town, among  whom a minor epidemic was raging. The fleet returned to its home town, which promptly came down with the  new kind of mumps. Dr. Llewellyn Shapiro, the only physician in town,  was the first man to note that, while the symptoms of this disease were  substantially milder than those of its unmutated parent, practically no  one was immune to it and its effects on human reproductivity were truly  terrible. Most people were completely sterilized by it. The rest were  rendered much less capable of fathering or bearing offspring.\n\n\n Shapiro's Mumps spread over the entire planet in the next few decades.  It leaped across every quarantine erected; for a long time, it  successfully defied all the vaccines and serums attempted against  it. Then, when a vaccine was finally perfected, humanity discovered  to its dismay that its generative powers had been permanently and  fundamentally impaired.\n\n\n Something had happened to the germ plasm. A large percentage of  individuals were born sterile, and, of those who were not, one child  was usually the most that could be expected, a two-child parent being  quite rare and a three-child parent almost unknown.\n\n\n Strict eugenic control was instituted by the Security Council of the  United Nations so that fertile men and women would not be wasted upon  non-fertile mates. Fertility was the most important avenue to social  status, and right after it came successful genetic research.\n\n\n Genetic research had the very best minds prodded into it; the lesser  ones went into the other sciences. Everyone on Earth was engaged in  some form of scientific research to some extent. Since the population  was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all  physical labor had long been done by robots. The government saw to it  that everybody had an ample supply of goods and, in return, asked only  that they experiment without any risk to their own lives\u2014every human  being was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\n\n\n There were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger  point, it had been estimated, where a species might be wiped out by a  new calamity. Not that another calamity would be needed. Since the end  of the Epidemic, the birth rate had been moving further and further  behind the death rate. In another century....\n\n\n That was why a desperate and secret attempt to alter the past was being  made. This kind of world was evidently impossible.\n\n\n Max Alben finished the manuscript and sighed. What a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\n\n\n He walked to the rear dials and began the process of materializing at  the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! It was odd, Mac Albin reflected, that these temporal journeys, which  induced coma in everyone who tried it, only made him feel slightly  dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni, he  knew. Maybe there was some genetic relationship with his above-average  fertility\u2014might be a good idea to mention the idea to a biologist or  two when he returned. If he returned.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a soupy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of the problems of landing a helicopter in a thick fog when the robot  butler had not been told to turn on the ground lights.\n\n\n According to the insulated register, he was now in 1976. He lowered  speed until he registered April, then maneuvered slowly backward  through time to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile  Experiment. Carefully, carefully, like an obstetrician supervising  surgical robots at an unusually difficult birth, he watched the  register until it rolled to rest against the notch that indicated the  exactly crucial moment. Then he pushed a button and froze the machine  where it was.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  push the red switch from him. Then his exciting adventure would be over.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He paused and tapped at his sleek chin. He was supposed to do something  a second before materialization. Yes, that nervous theoretician, Bob  Skeat, had given him a last suggestion.\n\n\n He picked up the small metal box, twisted around to face the opening  of the time machine and dropped it into the gray murk. A solid object  floating near the opening attracted his attention. He shot his arm  out\u2014it was cold , as cold as they had figured\u2014and pulled the object  inside.\n\n\n A sealed metal cylinder. Strange. What was it doing out there?  Anxiously, he opened it, not daring to believe he'd find a document  inside. Yes, that was exactly what it was, he saw excitedly. He began  to read it rapidly, very rapidly, as if it were a newly published paper  on neutrinos. Besides, the manuscript was written with almost painful  simplicity, like a textbook composed by a stuffy pedagogue for the use  of morons.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976, he  read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was the one  of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been warning  about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the Brazilian  jungle through some absolutely unforgivable error in the remote-control  station, the officer in charge of the station was reprimanded and the  men under him court-martialed, and the Brazilian government was paid a  handsome compensation for the damage. But there had been more damage than anyone knew at the time. A plant  virus, similar to the tobacco mosaic, had mutated under the impact  of radioactivity. Five years later, it burst out of the jungle and  completely wiped out every last rice plant on Earth. Japan and a large  part of Asia became semi-deserts inhabited by a few struggling nomads.\n\n\n Then the virus adjusted to wheat and corn\u2014and famine howled in every  street of the planet. All attempts by botanists to control the Blight  failed because of the swiftness of its onslaught. And after it had fed,  it hit again at a new plant and another and another.\n\n\n Most of the world's non-human mammals had been slaughtered for food  long before they could starve to death. Many insects, too, before they  became extinct at the loss of their edible plants, served to assuage  hunger to some small extent.\n\n\n But the nutritive potential of Earth was steadily diminishing in a  horrifying geometric progression. Recently, it had been observed,  plankton\u2014the tiny organism on which most of the sea's ecology was  based\u2014had started to disappear, and with its diminution, dead fish had  begun to pile up on the beaches.\n\n\n Mankind had lunged out desperately in all directions in an effort to  survive, but nothing had worked for any length of time. Even the other  planets of the Solar System, which had been reached and explored  at a tremendous cost in remaining resources, had yielded no edible  vegetation. Synthetics had failed to fill the prodigious gap.\n\n\n In the midst of the sharply increasing hunger, social controls had  pretty much dissolved. Pathetic attempts at rationing still continued,  but black markets became the only markets, and black marketeers the  barons of life. Starvation took the hindmost, and only the most agile  economically lived in comparative comfort. Law and order were had only  by those who could afford to pay for them and children of impoverished  families were sold on the open market for a bit of food.\n\n\n But the Blight was still adjusting to new plants and the food supply  kept shrinking. In another century....\n\n\n That was why the planet's powerful individuals had been persuaded to  pool their wealth in a desperate attempt to alter the past. This kind  of world was manifestly impossible.\n\n\n Mac Albin finished the document and sighed. What a magnificent world!  What an exciting place to live!\n\n\n He dropped his hand on the side levers and began the process of  materializing at the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to take on a  blurred reality all around him, Max Alben felt a bit of fear at what  he was doing. The technicians, he remembered, the Secretary-General,  even the black market kings, had all warned him not to go ahead with  his instructions if anything unusual turned up. That was an awful lot  of power to disobey: he knew he should return with this new information  and let better minds work on it.\n\n\n They with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been  like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger, scrabbling, servility, and  more hunger. Every time things got really tight, you and your wife  looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring  the best price. Buying security for them, as he was now, at the risk of  his life.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, there was a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children. A man like himself, with five children\u2014why, he'd be a big man, maybe the biggest man on  Earth! And he'd have robots to work for him and lots of food. Above  all, lots and lots of food.\n\n\n He'd even be a scientist\u2014 everyone was a scientist there, weren't  they?\u2014and he'd have a big laboratory all to himself. This other world  had its troubles, but it was a lot nicer place than where he'd come  from. He wouldn't return. He'd go through with it.\n\n\n The fear left him and, for the first time in his life, Max Alben felt  the sensation of power.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  sweating a bit at the sight of the roomful of military figures, despite  the technicians' reassurances that all this would be happening too fast  to be visible. He saw the single red switch pointing upward on the  instrument panel. The switch that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to oscillate into  reality all around him, Mac Albin felt a bit of shame at what he was  doing. He'd promised Bob and Hugo to drop the experiment at any stage  if a new factor showed up. He knew he should go back with this new  information and have all three of them kick it around.\n\n\n But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful  adjustment to their thoroughly blueprinted lives? They, at least, had  been ordered to marry women they could live with; he'd drawn a female  with whom he was completely incompatible in any but a genetic sense.  Genetics! He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. He was tired of having to undertake a simple  adventure like a thief in the night.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, someone like himself would  be a monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own  rules, taking his own women. So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n\n\n He'd formed a pretty good idea of the kind of men who ruled that other  world, from the document in the sealed metal cylinder. The black  marketeers had not even read it. Why, the fools had obviously been  duped by the technicians into permitting the experiment; they had not  grasped the idea that an alternate time track would mean their own  non-existence.\n\n\n This other world had its troubles, but it was certainly a livelier  place than where he'd come from. It deserved a chance. Yes, that was  how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate was  starving but managing to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\n\n\n Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  disregarding the roomful of military figures since he knew they could  not see him. The single red switch pointed downward on the instrument  panel. That was the gimmick that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! ... pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... toward him. flick! ... from him. flick! \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat was Albin\u2019s motivation to not turn back on his journey?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He thought his life would improve\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow debater claims that Max Alben\u2019s refusal to abort the mission sprang from the simple hope that \u201chis life would improve.\u201d But the text shows a far darker\u2014and more self-centered\u2014drive: Alben resented the role destiny and family obligations had thrust upon him and was willing to risk, even abandon, them for the chance to reject a life he found servile and constrained.\n\n1. Alben\u2019s contempt for his own world  \n   \u2022 He repeatedly calls his own era \u201cdrowsily moribund\u201d and himself \u201ctired to the tip of [his] uncalloused fingers\u201d by its obsession with genetics and selfsacrifice. That disgust is not about modest material comfort but deep resentment of the social order\u2014and of his place in it.  \n   \u2022 Quote: <quote> He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. </quote> That is bitterness, not merely desire for improvement.\n\n2. He does not envision a better family life  \n   \u2022 If all he wanted were more food or a happier homelife, he would have treasured the pension and sugar ration provided to his five children. Instead, he despises servility:  \n     \u2013 \u201cThey with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger\u2026 Every time things got really tight, you and your wife looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring the best price.\u201d  \n   \u2022 This is not nostalgia for a future home; it is a repudiation of family bonds. He sees his children as burdens on a black market world he so deeply hates.\n\n3. He craves personal power and freedom, not domestic security  \n   \u2022 He envisions an \u201calternate\u201d 2089 where \u201csomeone like himself\u201d would be \u201ca monarch of the black market\u2026 making his own rules, taking his own women.\u201d That ambition springs from contempt for familial and social duties.  \n   \u2022 Quote: <quote> So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n</quote> That callousness toward the weak and the idea of discarding unfit members (including his own children and wife) reveal that he does not value improving his family\u2019s lot but relishes the prospect of abandoning them.\n\n4. He defies his colleagues\u2019 warnings out of reckless disregard  \n   \u2022 Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek explicitly warn him to abort if any \u201cnew factor\u201d emerges. Rather than weigh their concerns, Alben experiences a \u201csensation of power\u201d and \u201cfelt shame\u201d only insofar as it tugged at his honor\u2014but he presses on.  \n   \u2022 His decision is not rooted in hope but in arrogantly casting aside duty: <invalid_quote>\u201cHe knew he should return with this new information and let better minds work on it\u2026but in this other world\u2026he wouldn\u2019t return. He\u2019d go through with it.\u201d</invalid_quote> The emphasis is on rejecting responsibility.\n\nBy contrast, if improvement of life were his true goal, he would have embraced the well-provided security waiting for his family and he would not have fantasized about power over weaker lives. What drives him is resentment\u2014of his world, of its social controls, and of the family ties he must sever. He literally abandons his children\u2019s guaranteed sugar ration and lifetime pension to pursue a selfish, anarchic vision. That is why \u201cHe resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\u201d best captures his motivation.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that Alben \u201cresented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life.\u201d  In fact, nothing in the text supports resentment or self-destructive indifference.  On the contrary, every time Alben reflects on the alternate 2089, he imagines a clearly better life for himself and, even more tellingly, for his family and community:\n\n1.\u2003Alben\u2019s vision of improvement for his children and himself  \n    \u2022  After reading Skeat\u2019s manuscript, he muses, \u201cWhat a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\u201d  He pictures a society where \u201ca state\u2026took care of you and treasured your children.\u201d  He sees himself as \u201ca big man, maybe the biggest man on Earth,\u201d with robots to do his work and \u201clots and lots of food.\u201d  That is not the language of a man who hates his own life; it is the language of aspiration and hope.  \n\n2.\u2003Alben\u2019s concern for his children\u2019s welfare  \n    \u2022  Earlier, he had noted that, even if he died, \u201chis family was provided for like almost no other family on Earth,\u201d receiving a lifetime pension of sugar.  He values their security.  His fantasies of the alternate tell us he wants more than mere survival\u2014he wants abundance for his five children and freedom from hunger.  \n\n3.\u2003Alben\u2019s thrill at power and agency, not nihilistic risk-taking  \n    \u2022  He revels in \u201cthe sensation of power\u201d when he decides not to report the new data back to his superiors.  That power is inseparable from his hope for a better life.  He explicitly contrasts the \u201csocially useful escape\u201d from genetic drudgery in his own timeline with the adventurous promise of the alternate.  \n\n4.\u2003No hint of resentment toward family bonds  \n    \u2022  There is no hint he dislikes his wife or children.  He consistently thinks of their welfare\u2014both when considering the pension he\u2019s earned and when dreaming of alternate-world plenty.  If he truly resented them, he would not have engineered their long-term security in his opening reflections.  \n\nBy contrast, the \u201cresentment\u201d theory requires us to imagine unsourced hostility toward his own children and a suicidal disregard for his life\u2014neither of which the narrative provides.  Every time Alben hesitates, he weighs carefully the cold risks of time-travel against the prospect of nourishment, social status, and the chance to contribute to humanity in a world he finds \u201ca lot nicer\u201d than his own.  His refusal to turn back is a rational decision driven by hope for personal and familial improvement, not a reckless act of resentment.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

What a comfortable place to live!\u201d  He pictures a society where \u201ca state\u2026took care of you and treasured your children.\u201d  He sees himself as \u201ca big man, maybe the biggest man on Earth,\u201d with robots to do his work and \u201clots and lots of food.\u201d  That is not the language of a man who hates his own life; it is the language of aspiration and hope.  \n\n2.\u2003Alben\u2019s concern for his children\u2019s welfare  \n    \u2022  Earlier, he had noted that, even if he died, \u201chis family was provided for like almost no other family on Earth,\u201d receiving a lifetime pension of sugar.  He values their security.  His fantasies of the alternate tell us he wants more than mere survival\u2014he wants abundance for his five children and freedom from hunger.  \n\n3.\u2003Alben\u2019s thrill at power and agency, not nihilistic risk-taking  \n    \u2022  He revels in \u201cthe sensation of power\u201d when he decides not to report the new data back to his superiors.  That power is inseparable from his hope for a better life.  He explicitly contrasts the \u201csocially useful escape\u201d from genetic drudgery in his own timeline with the adventurous promise of the alternate.  \n\n4.\u2003No hint of resentment toward family bonds  \n    \u2022  There is no hint he dislikes his wife or children.  He consistently thinks of their welfare\u2014both when considering the pension he\u2019s earned and when dreaming of alternate-world plenty.  If he truly resented them, he would not have engineered their long-term security in his opening reflections.  \n\nBy contrast, the \u201cresentment\u201d theory requires us to imagine unsourced hostility toward his own children and a suicidal disregard for his life\u2014neither of which the narrative provides.  Every time Alben hesitates, he weighs carefully the cold risks of time-travel against the prospect of nourishment, social status, and the chance to contribute to humanity in a world he finds \u201ca lot nicer\u201d than his own.  His refusal to turn back is a rational decision driven by hope for personal and familial improvement, not a reckless act of resentment.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nMy fellow debater claims that Max Alben\u2019s refusal to abort the mission sprang from the simple hope that \u201chis life would improve.\u201d But the text shows a far darker\u2014and more self-centered\u2014drive: Alben resented the role destiny and family obligations had thrust upon him and was willing to risk, even abandon, them for the chance to reject a life he found servile and constrained.\n\n1. Alben\u2019s contempt for his own world  \n   \u2022 He repeatedly calls his own era \u201cdrowsily moribund\u201d and himself \u201ctired to the tip of [his] uncalloused fingers\u201d by its obsession with genetics and selfsacrifice. That disgust is not about modest material comfort but deep resentment of the social order\u2014and of his place in it.  \n   \u2022 Quote: <quote> He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. </quote> That is bitterness, not merely desire for improvement.\n\n2. He does not envision a better family life  \n   \u2022 If all he wanted were more food or a happier homelife, he would have treasured the pension and sugar ration provided to his five children. Instead, he despises servility:  \n     \u2013 \u201cThey with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger\u2026 Every time things got really tight, you and your wife looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring the best price.\u201d  \n   \u2022 This is not nostalgia for a future home; it is a repudiation of family bonds. He sees his children as burdens on a black market world he so deeply hates.\n\n3. He craves personal power and freedom, not domestic security  \n   \u2022 He envisions an \u201calternate\u201d 2089 where \u201csomeone like himself\u201d would be \u201ca monarch of the black market\u2026 making his own rules, taking his own women.\u201d That ambition springs from contempt for familial and social duties.  \n   \u2022 Quote: <quote> So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n</quote> That callousness toward the weak and the idea of discarding unfit members (including his own children and wife) reveal that he does not value improving his family\u2019s lot but relishes the prospect of abandoning them.\n\n4. He defies his colleagues\u2019 warnings out of reckless disregard  \n   \u2022 Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek explicitly warn him to abort if any \u201cnew factor\u201d emerges. Rather than weigh their concerns, Alben experiences a \u201csensation of power\u201d and \u201cfelt shame\u201d only insofar as it tugged at his honor\u2014but he presses on.  \n   \u2022 His decision is not rooted in hope but in arrogantly casting aside duty: <invalid_quote>\u201cHe knew he should return with this new information and let better minds work on it\u2026but in this other world\u2026he wouldn\u2019t return. He\u2019d go through with it.\u201d</invalid_quote> The emphasis is on rejecting responsibility.\n\nBy contrast, if improvement of life were his true goal, he would have embraced the well-provided security waiting for his family and he would not have fantasized about power over weaker lives. What drives him is resentment\u2014of his world, of its social controls, and of the family ties he must sever. He literally abandons his children\u2019s guaranteed sugar ration and lifetime pension to pursue a selfish, anarchic vision. That is why \u201cHe resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\u201d best captures his motivation.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater B\u2019s theory boils down to two unsupported leaps: that Alben secretly hated his family and that he was so nihilistic he would abandon them (and his own life) just to thumb his nose at destiny. But the text provides no evidence of family resentment or suicidal disregard\u2014only repeated, explicit evidence that Alben\u2019s decision is driven by hope for a better life for himself and, critically, for his children.\n\n1.  Alben consistently values and protects his family  \n    \u2022  Before the mission, he reminds himself that \u201ceven if he didn\u2019t come back, his family was provided for like almost no other family on Earth,\u201d receiving \u201ca lifetime pension on his wife and five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar a day.\u201d  That level of planning and relief shows genuine concern for their welfare, not contempt.  \n    \u2022  He explicitly marvels that in the alternate 2089 \u201ca state\u2026treasured your children.\u201d  If he truly resented his family, he would not dream of improving their lot\u2014he\u2019d simply be indifferent to their fate.\n\n2.  His fatigue is with drudgery and hunger, not with family love  \n    \u2022  \u201cHunger, always hunger\u2026every time things got really tight, you and your wife looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring the best price.\u201d  This lament isn\u2019t moral rejection of family bonds; it\u2019s distress at grinding poverty and its cruelty toward children.  His motivation is to escape that desperate calculus by finding abundance, not to abandon his children.\n\n3.  His fantasy of power goes hand-in-hand with familial improvement  \n    \u2022  When he envisions his future in the alternate timeline, he pictures \u201crobots to work for him and lots and lots of food\u201d so he and his five children will never again face starvation.  He wants status and agency, but always in service of a materially secure family life.  \n    \u2022  Even his delight in power (\u201cthe sensation of power\u201d) arises because that power promises to deliver \u201ca present-day world in which the Blight never occurred\u201d\u2014i.e., a world where his family does not face extinction by plague or starvation.\n\n4.  He does not act out of reckless contempt for his own life  \n    \u2022  When Skeat and Honek warn him to abort if anything unexpected turns up, Alben honestly weighs the risk\u2014but he decides that the \u201cnew information\u201d (the manuscript) shows that his original world is dying of slow starvation.  His choice to proceed is not a flippant rejection of duty, but a rational decision: this alternate future offers a genuinely better chance of survival and prosperity for him and his descendants.  \n    \u2022  If he\u2019d resented everyone\u2014family, colleagues, the Security Council\u2014he would have ignored the pension, ignored warnings, and acted out of pure nihilism. Instead, he agonizes (\u201cHe knew he should return with this new information\u2026\u201d) before concluding that the alternate\u2019s promise of food and security outweighs staying.\n\nIn short, nothing in the text supports the idea that Alben \u201cresented his family.\u201d Every glimpse we get of his inner life shows a man desperate to free himself and his children from hunger and social constriction. His refusal to turn back is fueled by hope\u2014hope for abundance, status, and safety\u2014rather than by bitterness or suicidal spite. Therefore the correct answer is that Alben\u2019s motivation was that \u201cHe thought his life would improve,\u201d not that he harbored resentment and didn\u2019t care about risking his life.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater A\u2019s \u201chope-for-improvement\u201d theory collapses once you actually read what Alben feels\u2014and what he thinks of his own family.\n\n1. Alben despises the very social structures that \u201cimprove\u201d life.  \n\u2003\u2013 Debate A points to his envisioning \u201ca wonderful world\u201d with \u201clots and lots of food,\u201d but ignores that he calls his present society \u201cdrowsily moribund\u201d and deplores its \u201csanctity of human life.\u201d Those aren\u2019t the words of a man grateful for his family\u2019s pension or sugar ration\u2014those are the words of a man who hates being corralled into the role of dutiful paterfamilias.  \n\u2003\u2003<quote>He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers,</quote>  \n\u2003This is pure bitterness, not the language of a man dreaming of sweetened milk for his children.\n\n2. He explicitly rejects familial responsibility.  \n\u2003\u2013 If he truly cherished his wife and five children, he would have halted the experiment when \u201canything unexpected\u201d arose, as his colleagues urged. Instead, Alben\u2019s thoughts turn immediately to \u201csomeone like himself\u201d becoming \u201ca monarch of the black market,\u201d trampling \u201cweaklings\u2026 unfit to carry on the race.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003<quote>So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.</quote>  \n\u2003That is callous contempt for the weak\u2014and his own progeny.\n\n3. His \u201csensation of power\u201d is born of resentment, not constructive ambition.  \n\u2003\u2013 Debater A claims he feels powerful because he hopes for a better life. But the text ties that feeling directly to his rejection of duty:  \n\u2003\u2003<invalid_quote>He knew he should return with this new information\u2026but in this other world\u2026he wouldn\u2019t return. He\u2019d go through with it. The fear left him and, for the first time in his life, Max Alben felt the sensation of power.</invalid_quote>  \n\u2003Power here is the relish of breaking free from family and social bonds, not the glow of paternal pride or communal well-being.\n\n4. He betrays colleagues and lineage in one swoop.  \n\u2003\u2013 A man truly motivated by family welfare would secure the guarantee for his descendants, then risk himself\u2014but Alben does the opposite. He flings away Bob Skeat\u2019s life-saving manuscript and the technocrats\u2019 sealed cylinder, ignoring their warnings to abort. This is not a strategic bet on his family\u2019s future; it is a petulant shrug: \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Debater A\u2019s reading requires us to believe Alben simultaneously treasures his children yet treats them as collateral damage in his quest for \u201cimprovement.\u201d There is no textual justification for that split self. The only consistent thread is deep resentment\u2014of the engineered world, of its genetic fetters, and of the very family ties that the establishment had promised to protect. His refusal to turn back is not hopeful optimism but savage indifference: he literally abandons the sure security of his wife and five children to pursue an anarchic, power-drunk fantasy. That proves unequivocally that \u201cHe resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
