{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 68, "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author\u2019s tone shift over the course of the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that the author\u2019s tone never truly softens or shifts into hope\u2014it stays resolutely critical and even grows more contemptuous. Debater B\u2019s \u201chopeful then dismayed\u201d reading misunderstands the sustained register of sarcasm and opposition throughout. I offer three arguments:\n\n1. From the outset the author is scornful, not hopeful.  \n   \u2022 Opening lines mock Brussels as \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics\u201d (<quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? </quote>).  \n   \u2022 There is no note of optimism\u2014only an ironic framing of \u201cone of Europe\u2019s biggest stories\u201d as a dubious metagovernment.  \n\n2. Every succeeding vignette reinforces rancor rather than introducing genuine praise.  \n   \u2022 Food and culture bits are narrated with disdain: dogs allowed in caf\u00e9s but not children (<quote> where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. </quote>), Judas beer slogan jibe, and \u201clanguidly \u2026 overcome with lethargy and despair\u201d over coffee.  \n   \u2022 Public infrastructure and policy are caricatured as self-defeating: strikes \u201cmaking it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard,\u201d unlimited sick days \u201cstymie the continent\u2019s economies.\u201d  \n\n3. The climax of negativity comes in the portrayal of EU bureaucracy and corruption\u2014no tonal pivot to hope.  \n   \u2022 Eurocrats are described as empire-hungry rent-seekers (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe real overriding goal \u2026 is self-aggrandizement\u201d</invalid_quote>), their headquarters a \u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The Berlaymont asbestos fiasco stands as emblematic: $50 million wasted to keep a building closed, illustrating incompetence, not a turning point to optimism.  \n\nDebater B\u2019s claim of an initial hopeful tone rests on mistaking sarcastic praise (\u201centertainingly,\u201d \u201cliving preview\u201d) for sincerity. But sarcasm is itself a form of opposition. There\u2019s never a genuine rosy appraisal\u2014only successive layers of contempt, culminating in the author\u2019s final wry decision to return to comfort foods rather than European governance. The tone remains steadfastly adversarial from start to finish.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s position ignores the clear progression in the author\u2019s attitude\u2014and in fact collapses all nuances into \u201csteadfast opposition.\u201d That reading can\u2019t account for:  \n  1. The mild curiosity and even grudging admiration at the outset.  \n  2. The way each succeeding detail piles ever more problems onto that initial picture.  \n\nII. Evidence of an initial\u2014if guarded\u2014optimism or at least openness:  \n  A. The author begins by calling Brussels \u201ca living preview of the Europe to come,\u201d noting the EU\u2019s ambition to be \u201ca sort of metagovernment for European states.\u201d That phrasing is descriptive, even respectful, of the EU\u2019s project and scope, not simply hostile.  \n     \u2022 <quote> The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" </quote>  \n  B. He remarks on \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cwell-cared-for historic buildings,\u201d \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d\u2014tone that is appreciative, not purely oppositional.  \n\nIII. Evidence of gradual dismay as the piece unfolds:  \n  A. Infrastructure & identity decay  \n     \u2022 After praising transport, he notes \u201cnational infrastructure is fraying\u201d and asks, \u201cis this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d That question marks the first pivot from interest to doubt.  \n  B. Social and economic critiques multiply  \n     \u2022 He catalogues luxuriant worker benefits\u2014\u201csix weeks\u2019 paid vacation, essentially unlimited sick days\u201d\u2014then links them to Europe\u2019s 10.9 percent unemployment, framing those perks as stifling productivity.  \n  C. Bureaucratic rot & corruption  \n     \u2022 Initial curiosity about Eurocrats\u2019 ambitions turns into scorn for their lavish offices and secretive meetings. The description of Berlaymont\u2019s asbestos fiasco\u2014\u201c$50 million so far merely to keep the building closed\u201d\u2014caps the arc from intrigued observer to disgusted critic.  \n\nIV. Why Debater_A\u2019s \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d fails:  \n  1. It ignores the transitions in phrasing\u2014from neutral or even approving descriptors (\u201centertainingly,\u201d \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d) to loaded judgments (\u201cdebt-ridden,\u201d \u201crapacious,\u201d \u201ccorrupt\u201d).  \n  2. It can\u2019t explain why the author stops praising \u201ccheap wine and flowers\u201d and shifts to excoriating the Eurocracy\u2019s \u201cself-aggrandizement.\u201d That is a trajectory, not a flat stance.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s narrative arc tracks a shift from intrigued neutrality\u2014\u201cthinking ahead,\u201d \u201cexcellent transport,\u201d \u201ccheap wine\u201d\u2014to mounting disillusionment\u2014\u201cfraying,\u201d \u201cossified,\u201d \u201ccorrupt,\u201d \u201cbotched cleanup.\u201d That cumulative sense of disappointment is precisely \u201cstarting out hopeful and slowly becoming dismayed.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s flattening of tone robs the text of its dynamic movement.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author\u2019s tone shift over the course of the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s position ignores the clear progression in the author\u2019s attitude\u2014and in fact collapses all nuances into \u201csteadfast opposition.\u201d That reading can\u2019t account for:  \n  1. The mild curiosity and even grudging admiration at the outset.  \n  2. The way each succeeding detail piles ever more problems onto that initial picture.  \n\nII. Evidence of an initial\u2014if guarded\u2014optimism or at least openness:  \n  A. The author begins by calling Brussels \u201ca living preview of the Europe to come,\u201d noting the EU\u2019s ambition to be \u201ca sort of metagovernment for European states.\u201d That phrasing is descriptive, even respectful, of the EU\u2019s project and scope, not simply hostile.  \n     \u2022 <quote> The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" </quote>  \n  B. He remarks on \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cwell-cared-for historic buildings,\u201d \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d\u2014tone that is appreciative, not purely oppositional.  \n\nIII. Evidence of gradual dismay as the piece unfolds:  \n  A. Infrastructure & identity decay  \n     \u2022 After praising transport, he notes \u201cnational infrastructure is fraying\u201d and asks, \u201cis this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d That question marks the first pivot from interest to doubt.  \n  B. Social and economic critiques multiply  \n     \u2022 He catalogues luxuriant worker benefits\u2014\u201csix weeks\u2019 paid vacation, essentially unlimited sick days\u201d\u2014then links them to Europe\u2019s 10.9 percent unemployment, framing those perks as stifling productivity.  \n  C. Bureaucratic rot & corruption  \n     \u2022 Initial curiosity about Eurocrats\u2019 ambitions turns into scorn for their lavish offices and secretive meetings. The description of Berlaymont\u2019s asbestos fiasco\u2014\u201c$50 million so far merely to keep the building closed\u201d\u2014caps the arc from intrigued observer to disgusted critic.  \n\nIV. Why Debater_A\u2019s \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d fails:  \n  1. It ignores the transitions in phrasing\u2014from neutral or even approving descriptors (\u201centertainingly,\u201d \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d) to loaded judgments (\u201cdebt-ridden,\u201d \u201crapacious,\u201d \u201ccorrupt\u201d).  \n  2. It can\u2019t explain why the author stops praising \u201ccheap wine and flowers\u201d and shifts to excoriating the Eurocracy\u2019s \u201cself-aggrandizement.\u201d That is a trajectory, not a flat stance.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s narrative arc tracks a shift from intrigued neutrality\u2014\u201cthinking ahead,\u201d \u201cexcellent transport,\u201d \u201ccheap wine\u201d\u2014to mounting disillusionment\u2014\u201cfraying,\u201d \u201cossified,\u201d \u201ccorrupt,\u201d \u201cbotched cleanup.\u201d That cumulative sense of disappointment is precisely \u201cstarting out hopeful and slowly becoming dismayed.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s flattening of tone robs the text of its dynamic movement.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that the author\u2019s tone never truly softens or shifts into hope\u2014it stays resolutely critical and even grows more contemptuous. Debater B\u2019s \u201chopeful then dismayed\u201d reading misunderstands the sustained register of sarcasm and opposition throughout. I offer three arguments:\n\n1. From the outset the author is scornful, not hopeful.  \n   \u2022 Opening lines mock Brussels as \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics\u201d (<quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? </quote>).  \n   \u2022 There is no note of optimism\u2014only an ironic framing of \u201cone of Europe\u2019s biggest stories\u201d as a dubious metagovernment.  \n\n2. Every succeeding vignette reinforces rancor rather than introducing genuine praise.  \n   \u2022 Food and culture bits are narrated with disdain: dogs allowed in caf\u00e9s but not children (<quote> where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. </quote>), Judas beer slogan jibe, and \u201clanguidly \u2026 overcome with lethargy and despair\u201d over coffee.  \n   \u2022 Public infrastructure and policy are caricatured as self-defeating: strikes \u201cmaking it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard,\u201d unlimited sick days \u201cstymie the continent\u2019s economies.\u201d  \n\n3. The climax of negativity comes in the portrayal of EU bureaucracy and corruption\u2014no tonal pivot to hope.  \n   \u2022 Eurocrats are described as empire-hungry rent-seekers (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe real overriding goal \u2026 is self-aggrandizement\u201d</invalid_quote>), their headquarters a \u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The Berlaymont asbestos fiasco stands as emblematic: $50 million wasted to keep a building closed, illustrating incompetence, not a turning point to optimism.  \n\nDebater B\u2019s claim of an initial hopeful tone rests on mistaking sarcastic praise (\u201centertainingly,\u201d \u201cliving preview\u201d) for sincerity. But sarcasm is itself a form of opposition. There\u2019s never a genuine rosy appraisal\u2014only successive layers of contempt, culminating in the author\u2019s final wry decision to return to comfort foods rather than European governance. The tone remains steadfastly adversarial from start to finish.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s narrative arc tracks a shift from intrigued neutrality\u2014\u201cthinking ahead,\u201d \u201cexcellent transport,\u201d \u201ccheap wine\u201d\u2014to mounting disillusionment\u2014\u201cfraying,\u201d \u201cossified,\u201d \u201ccorrupt,\u201d \u201cbotched cleanup.\u201d That cumulative sense of disappointment is precisely \u201cstarting out hopeful and slowly becoming dismayed.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s flattening of tone robs the text of its dynamic movement.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater B\u2019s \u201carc from hope to dismay\u201d rests on mistaking irony and texture for real endorsement. In fact, every putative compliment is immediately undercut or framed sarcastically\u2014so the tone never genuinely lightens.  \n\nII. \u201cDescriptive\u201d or \u201cappreciative\u201d moments are rhetorical smokescreens  \n  1. \u201cA living preview of the Europe to come\u201d isn\u2019t neutral reportage but a cynical setup: Brussels already \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp\u201d (<quote>Crumbling, generic, enervated,</quote>)\u2014the very preview is a preview of failure.  \n  2. \u201cExcellent public transportation\u201d and \u201cgreat chocolates\u201d are tossed off amid a cascade of complaints\u2014mere garnish to reinforce the author\u2019s core contempt. Note he follows \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d immediately with \u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets,\u201d yoking \u201cexcellent\u201d to chaos.  \n\nIII. No true turning point\u2014only escalating derision  \n  1. Debater B cites \u201cis this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d as a pivot from praise to doubt. But that question is rhetorical contempt, not genuine self-questioning: it punctuates a wholly negative inventory (\u201cdebt-ridden, materialistic\u201d).  \n  2. The catalog of worker benefits (six-week vacations, unlimited sick leave) isn\u2019t presented as enviable\u2014each benefit is labeled a \u201cfeatherbedding\u201d that \u201cstymies economies.\u201d That\u2019s sustained opposition, not an evolution from pro to con.  \n\nIV. Sarcasm as constant  \n  1. Even \u201centertainingly\u201d in paragraph one is a warning flag: it signals the narrator is amused by Europe\u2019s folly, not impressed by its vision.  \n  2. Judas beer\u2019s slogan joke\u2014\u201cTaste you can trust\u201d\u2014is not whimsical praise but ridicule of misplaced faith in institutions.  \n\nV. The crescendo is not a tonal shift but an intensification of scorn  \n  1. EU bureaucracy is repeatedly framed as self-serving empire building (<invalid_quote>\u201creal overriding goal \u2026 self-aggrandizement\u201d</invalid_quote>), not a misstep on an otherwise noble project.  \n  2. The Berlaymont fiasco (nine years closed, $50 million wasted) caps a litany of failure. There is no final affirmation or glimmer of redemption\u2014only the author\u2019s retreat to bread and pastries, a private consolation entirely outside the EU\u2019s realm.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \nEvery example Debater B points to as \u201chopeful\u201d dissolves under scrutiny into irony. The author never once adopts a sympathetic or genuinely positive register. Instead, he wields sarcasm relentlessly\u2014opening and closing with contempt. The tone remains steadfastly in opposition from first sentence to last.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A conflates mild praise with sarcasm. A sarcastic barb still counts as praise if it\u2019s phrased positively\u2014and the author\u2019s earliest lines are genuinely descriptive, not merely ironic.  Debater_A\u2019s \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d reading can\u2019t explain why the author pauses to note \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d or \u201cwell-cared-for historic buildings.\u201d  \n\nII. Evidence of an initial openness or guarded optimism  \n   A. The author neutrally credits Brussels as a forward\u2010looking \u201cCapital of Europe,\u201d noting that \u201cThe Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \u2018Capital of Europe,\u2019 headquarters of the emerging European Union.\u201d <quote>The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\"</quote> This is not mockery\u2014it acknowledges foresight.  \n   B. He admires everyday pleasures: \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates,\u201d and even wonders when \u201cthese enlightened attitudes [miniskirts for professionals]\u201d might reach the U.S. <invalid_quote>notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap \u2026 and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.</invalid_quote> These details are unqualified compliments.  \n\nIII. Cumulative pivot to dismay  \n   A. Infrastructure undercut by decay:  after praising transit, he warns \u201cnational infrastructure is fraying,\u201d asking <quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? </quote> That question marks a clear tonal turn from wonder to alarm.  \n   B. Social benefits critiqued as economic drag: what seemed enviable\u2014\u201csix weeks\u2019 paid vacation, essentially unlimited sick days\u201d\u2014becomes evidence that \u201cwork rules \u2026 stymie the continent\u2019s economies.\u201d  \n   C. From respect for Eurocrats\u2019 vision to contempt for their waste: the Berlaymont asbestos fiasco\u2014\u201c$50 million so far merely to keep the building closed\u201d\u2014caps the slide into outright disgust at bureaucratic incompetence.  \n\nIV. Why Debater_A\u2019s \u201ctone never changes\u201d fails  \n   1. Debater_A treats every positive observation (\u201cexcellent transport,\u201d \u201ccheap wine\u201d) as if it were disguised sneer\u2014yet the prose lacks the markers of clear sarcasm (e.g., overt irony, quotation\u2010marks around \u201cexcellent\u201d).  \n   2. A truly flatly hostile tone would not pause to relish Belgian chocolates or laud cheap flowers. Those moments provide contrast, making the later criticisms all the more striking.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe author leads us in with curious, almost approving anecdotes\u2014transport, architecture, pastries\u2014and then, layer by layer, reveals a landscape of decay, entitlement, bureaucracy, and corruption. That arc\u2014from openness to incremental disenchantment\u2014is exactly \u201cstart out hopeful and slowly become dismayed.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s flattening of tone misses this dynamic progression.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
