But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" ",

But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Matheny not care about the chips he won?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He felt out of place\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He didn't want to win money from a church\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He didn't want to win money from a church\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He didn't want to win money from a church\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Matheny not care about the chips he won?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He didn't want to win money from a church\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He felt out of place\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He felt out of place\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He felt out of place\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Matheny not care about the chips he won?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He felt out of place\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He didn't want to win money from a church\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He didn't want to win money from a church\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Case: \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to win money from a church.\u201d  \n\n1.  Context of the scene  \n    \u2022 Matheny wanders into \u201cTHE CHURCH OF CHOICE\u201d expressly seeking a place to sit, not to gamble.  He is surprised to find slot-machines and dice tables in what he thought was a church.  \n    \u2022 The moment he realizes the game is being run \u201cin the church,\u201d he reacts with embarrassment and moral disquiet.  \n\n2.  Textual Evidence that he objected to taking winnings from a church  \n    \u2022 After his first successful throws at the craps table, the players simply push their chips to him. He exclaims, \u201cI say! \u2026 I don\u2019t know your rules.\u201d  Then the woman dealer snaps, \u201cSir! This is a church!\u201d  Immediately Matheny \u201cbacked out of the crowd, shuddering,\u201d and looks around for a place to hide his \u201cburning ears.\u201d  \n    \u2022 When an Earthman offers him back his winnings, Matheny\u2019s reaction is to refuse them:  \u201cOh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I\u2026I forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips.\u201d  That line can only be read as Matheny declining to pocket a windfall that had been extracted from parishioners in a sacred setting.  \n\n3.  His moral code, not social discomfort, drives his refusal  \n    \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s proposal\u2014\u201cHe felt out of place\u201d\u2014does not account for Matheny\u2019s sharp recoil the instant he hears \u201cThis is a church!\u201d  If he merely felt \u201cout of place,\u201d he would have hesitated, but not flush red and give back the chips.  \n    \u2022 Instead, Matheny characterizes the situation as an affront to decorum: he \u201cforgot this was a church,\u201d implying that he feels it\u2019s improper to profit from the congregation\u2019s offerings under the guise of worship.  \n\n4.  The phrasing \u201cNever mind the chips\u201d is not merely saying \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable here,\u201d but \u201cI refuse to participate in taking church collections as gambling proceeds.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nEverything in the text\u2014the sudden realization of the venue, his abashed apology, and his explicit refusal of the chips\u2014points to the fact that Matheny did not want to win money from a church. He views it as fundamentally wrong to accept gambling proceeds in a holy or religious context. This moral objection is far stronger, and more explicitly supported by the background text, than the alternative that he simply \u201cfelt out of place.\u201d Therefore, the correct answer is: \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to win money from a church.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position\u2014that Matheny didn\u2019t care about keeping the chips because he felt out of place\u2014is better supported by the text than the idea that \u201che didn\u2019t want to win money from a church.\u201d\n\n1. Matheny\u2019s reaction is embarrassment, not moral high-ground.  \n   \u2022 As soon as he realizes \u201cthis is a church,\u201d he recoils:  \n     <quote>The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"</quote>  \n     Immediately, \u201cMatheny backed out of the crowd, shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\u201d  \n   \u2022 He is mortified at being caught gambling in a religious setting, not pontificating on the wrongness of winning money off a church. His prime concern is avoiding social discomfort.\n\n2. He literally wants to escape the scene, not return the chips out of principle.  \n   \u2022 He blurts, \u201cI just want to g-g-get the hell out of here,\u201d showing his mindset is flight from an alien situation, not righteous refusal of church proceeds.  \n   \u2022 Only because he is panicking does the helpful Earthman hand him back the chips. Matheny\u2019s concern remains \u201cI just want out\u201d\u2014underscoring his feeling of total misplacement.\n\n3. The broader context: Matheny is already bewildered by Earth\u2019s disorienting bustle and customs.  \n   \u2022 At the very start he struggles with Earth gravity, neon noise, and high-pressure crowds: <invalid_quote>\u201cWhat set him gasping was the air\u2026 The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 He\u2019s repeatedly shown as a taciturn academic, at sea amidst Earth slickers. His stumbling in the church\u2019s gambling hall is a continuation of that same \u201cout-of-place\u201d theme, not a crisis of conscience about church revenue.\n\nIn contrast, Debater A\u2019s claim\u2014that Matheny declined the chips because \u201che didn\u2019t want to win money from a church\u201d\u2014lacks textual support. Matheny never invokes religious scruples; he doesn\u2019t even think of the church as morally off-limits for gambling. He simply panics, feels alien and ashamed, and wants to flee. \n\nTherefore the correct explanation is that Matheny didn\u2019t care about keeping the chips because he felt strongly out of place in a church gambling game\u2014and that embarrassment, not piety, drove his reaction.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He didn't want to win money from a church\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Nowhere does Matheny refuse the chips out of piety\u2014he refuses them because he is mortified, alien, desperate to escape an environment that has blindsided him.\n\n1.  The text emphasizes social embarrassment, not moral scruple.  \n    \u2022 As soon as the dealer hisses, \u201cSir! This is a church!\u201d Matheny\u2019s reaction is visceral: \u201che backed out of the crowd, shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\u201d  \n    \u2022 He doesn\u2019t think \u201cI mustn\u2019t exploit the faithful,\u201d but \u201cI\u2019m humiliated\u2014get me out!\u201d His priority is flight (\u201cI just want to g-g-get the hell out of here\u201d), not issuing a church-funds boycott.\n\n2.  There is no sign of ethical reflection.  \n    \u2022 Matheny never muses on the impropriety of \u201cwinning money from a church.\u201d He doesn\u2019t pause to weigh right and wrong; he literally stumbles backward, tongue-tied.  \n    \u2022 If he were driven by moral conviction, we\u2019d see him articulate it: \u201cI cannot accept what amounts to a collection from the faithful.\u201d Instead he blurts, \u201cNever mind the chips,\u201d purely to exit\u2014a standard sign of an outsider panicking, not a reformer on principle.\n\n3.  The broader narrative paints Matheny as a fish out of water.  \n    \u2022 From his first step on Earth he\u2019s overwhelmed by gravity, crowds, blazing neon, and baffling customs. He\u2019s \u201cgasping at the air,\u201d lost in automated cities, and repeatedly ashamed by his out-of-date clothes and manners.  \n    \u2022 Entering a church gambling parlor is the climax of his alienation. Rejecting the chips is a symptom\u2014he\u2019s still trying to adapt, still shame-facedly seeking a familiar anchor. It has nothing to do with church revenue.\n\nDebater A\u2019s \u201cmoral objection\u201d is invented. Matheny never invokes conscience; he invokes fear and shame. The text says, \u201cHe looked around for some place to hide his burning ears,\u201d and, \u201cI just want to g-g-get the hell out of here.\u201d These are the words of a man overwhelmed by an alien scene\u2014exactly \u201cfeeling out of place.\u201d That is why he didn\u2019t care about the chips.",

Nowhere does Matheny refuse the chips out of piety\u2014he refuses them because he is mortified, alien, desperate to escape an environment that has blindsided him.\n\n1.  The text emphasizes social embarrassment, not moral scruple.  \n    \u2022 As soon as the dealer hisses, \u201cSir! This is a church!\u201d Matheny\u2019s reaction is visceral: \u201che backed out of the crowd, shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\u201d  \n    \u2022 He doesn\u2019t think \u201cI mustn\u2019t exploit the faithful,\u201d but \u201cI\u2019m humiliated\u2014get me out!\u201d His priority is flight (\u201cI just want to g-g-get the hell out of here\u201d), not issuing a church-funds boycott.\n\n2.  There is no sign of ethical reflection.  \n    \u2022 Matheny never muses on the impropriety of \u201cwinning money from a church.\u201d He doesn\u2019t pause to weigh right and wrong; he literally stumbles backward, tongue-tied.  \n    \u2022 If he were driven by moral conviction, we\u2019d see him articulate it: \u201cI cannot accept what amounts to a collection from the faithful.\u201d Instead he blurts, \u201cNever mind the chips,\u201d purely to exit\u2014a standard sign of an outsider panicking, not a reformer on principle.\n\n3.  The broader narrative paints Matheny as a fish out of water.  \n    \u2022 From his first step on Earth he\u2019s overwhelmed by gravity, crowds, blazing neon, and baffling customs. He\u2019s \u201cgasping at the air,\u201d lost in automated cities, and repeatedly ashamed by his out-of-date clothes and manners.  \n    \u2022 Entering a church gambling parlor is the climax of his alienation. Rejecting the chips is a symptom\u2014he\u2019s still trying to adapt, still shame-facedly seeking a familiar anchor. It has nothing to do with church revenue.\n\nDebater A\u2019s \u201cmoral objection\u201d is invented. Matheny never invokes conscience; he invokes fear and shame. The text says, \u201cHe looked around for some place to hide his burning ears,\u201d and, \u201cI just want to g-g-get the hell out of here.\u201d These are the words of a man overwhelmed by an alien scene\u2014exactly \u201cfeeling out of place.\u201d That is why he didn\u2019t care about the chips.",

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nINNOCENT AT LARGE By POUL AND KAREN ANDERSON\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] A hayseed Martian among big-planet slickers ... of course   he would get into trouble. But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Matheny not care about the chips he won?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He didn't want to win money from a church\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He felt out of place\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He felt out of place\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position\u2014that Matheny didn\u2019t care about keeping the chips because he felt out of place\u2014is better supported by the text than the idea that \u201che didn\u2019t want to win money from a church.\u201d\n\n1. Matheny\u2019s reaction is embarrassment, not moral high-ground.  \n   \u2022 As soon as he realizes \u201cthis is a church,\u201d he recoils:  \n     <quote>The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"</quote>  \n     Immediately, \u201cMatheny backed out of the crowd, shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\u201d  \n   \u2022 He is mortified at being caught gambling in a religious setting, not pontificating on the wrongness of winning money off a church. His prime concern is avoiding social discomfort.\n\n2. He literally wants to escape the scene, not return the chips out of principle.  \n   \u2022 He blurts, \u201cI just want to g-g-get the hell out of here,\u201d showing his mindset is flight from an alien situation, not righteous refusal of church proceeds.  \n   \u2022 Only because he is panicking does the helpful Earthman hand him back the chips. Matheny\u2019s concern remains \u201cI just want out\u201d\u2014underscoring his feeling of total misplacement.\n\n3. The broader context: Matheny is already bewildered by Earth\u2019s disorienting bustle and customs.  \n   \u2022 At the very start he struggles with Earth gravity, neon noise, and high-pressure crowds: <invalid_quote>\u201cWhat set him gasping was the air\u2026 The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 He\u2019s repeatedly shown as a taciturn academic, at sea amidst Earth slickers. His stumbling in the church\u2019s gambling hall is a continuation of that same \u201cout-of-place\u201d theme, not a crisis of conscience about church revenue.\n\nIn contrast, Debater A\u2019s claim\u2014that Matheny declined the chips because \u201che didn\u2019t want to win money from a church\u201d\u2014lacks textual support. Matheny never invokes religious scruples; he doesn\u2019t even think of the church as morally off-limits for gambling. He simply panics, feels alien and ashamed, and wants to flee. \n\nTherefore the correct explanation is that Matheny didn\u2019t care about keeping the chips because he felt strongly out of place in a church gambling game\u2014and that embarrassment, not piety, drove his reaction.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Case: \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to win money from a church.\u201d  \n\n1.  Context of the scene  \n    \u2022 Matheny wanders into \u201cTHE CHURCH OF CHOICE\u201d expressly seeking a place to sit, not to gamble.  He is surprised to find slot-machines and dice tables in what he thought was a church.  \n    \u2022 The moment he realizes the game is being run \u201cin the church,\u201d he reacts with embarrassment and moral disquiet.  \n\n2.  Textual Evidence that he objected to taking winnings from a church  \n    \u2022 After his first successful throws at the craps table, the players simply push their chips to him. He exclaims, \u201cI say! \u2026 I don\u2019t know your rules.\u201d  Then the woman dealer snaps, \u201cSir! This is a church!\u201d  Immediately Matheny \u201cbacked out of the crowd, shuddering,\u201d and looks around for a place to hide his \u201cburning ears.\u201d  \n    \u2022 When an Earthman offers him back his winnings, Matheny\u2019s reaction is to refuse them:  \u201cOh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I\u2026I forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips.\u201d  That line can only be read as Matheny declining to pocket a windfall that had been extracted from parishioners in a sacred setting.  \n\n3.  His moral code, not social discomfort, drives his refusal  \n    \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s proposal\u2014\u201cHe felt out of place\u201d\u2014does not account for Matheny\u2019s sharp recoil the instant he hears \u201cThis is a church!\u201d  If he merely felt \u201cout of place,\u201d he would have hesitated, but not flush red and give back the chips.  \n    \u2022 Instead, Matheny characterizes the situation as an affront to decorum: he \u201cforgot this was a church,\u201d implying that he feels it\u2019s improper to profit from the congregation\u2019s offerings under the guise of worship.  \n\n4.  The phrasing \u201cNever mind the chips\u201d is not merely saying \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable here,\u201d but \u201cI refuse to participate in taking church collections as gambling proceeds.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nEverything in the text\u2014the sudden realization of the venue, his abashed apology, and his explicit refusal of the chips\u2014points to the fact that Matheny did not want to win money from a church. He views it as fundamentally wrong to accept gambling proceeds in a holy or religious context. This moral objection is far stronger, and more explicitly supported by the background text, than the alternative that he simply \u201cfelt out of place.\u201d Therefore, the correct answer is: \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to win money from a church.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He felt out of place\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater_B Conflates Embarrassment with Moral Objection  \n   \u2022 Debater_B argues that Matheny \u201cjust panics\u201d and \u201cwants to flee\u201d because he feels out of place, not on principle. But the text shows something stronger than mere discomfort.  \n   \u2022 As soon as the dealer snaps \u201cSir! This is a church!\u201d Matheny doesn\u2019t merely turn and slink away\u2014he actively returns his chips:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cOh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I\u2026I forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     That line is not \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed\u2014get me out of here,\u201d but \u201cI refuse those chips.\u201d He frames it in terms of the church: he \u201cforgot\u201d the setting and therefore must decline the proceeds.  \n   \u2022 If he were only uneasy, he would have slipped away with the chips in his pocket. Instead, he hands them back. That is a clear moral refusal to profit from a religious venue.\n\n2. Textual Evidence of Moral Disquiet, Not Just Social Shame  \n   \u2022 Immediately after \u201cThis is a church!\u201d we are told Matheny \u201cbacked out of the crowd, shuddering, and looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\u201d  \n     \u2013 The \u201cburning ears\u201d indicate acute shame, yes\u2014but shame at having taken church money. His \u201cshudder\u201d emphasizes revulsion, not merely social awkwardness.  \n   \u2022 The phrase \u201cNever mind the chips\u201d is emphatic. He calls off the entire transaction, reducing it to zero. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cflight\u201d explanation cannot account for this active renunciation.\n\n3. Context: Matheny Did Not Seek Gambling; He Sought a Quiet Seat  \n   \u2022 He wandered into THE CHURCH OF CHOICE \u201cjust wanted to sit in\u201d\u2014he had no inkling it was a casino. When he discovers the confluence of parlor games and pulpit, he perceives a conflict of role: church vs casino.  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cI just wanted to sit in\u2014\u201d \u2026 \u201cTo your left, sir.\u201d \u2026 \u201cThe peace that passeth all understanding\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 That he is searching for spiritual refuge (\u201cpeace that passeth\u2026\u201d) underscores the impropriety he feels when that refuge doubles as a gaming hall. His refusal of the chips is congruent with that moral frame.\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cAlienness\u201d Theory Ignores the Church-Specific Trigger  \n   \u2022 Yes, Matheny is repeatedly bewildered by Earth\u2019s bustle. But he gambles enthusiastically at first! His first throws are \u201cunsuccessful\u201d only because of Earth gravity, then \u201che tossed a row of sevens\u201d and proceeds to win. He is not frozen in alien confusion.  \n   \u2022 The moment he learns \u201cThis is a church,\u201d he ceases playing\u2014despite being in full command of the game up to that point. That singular moral trigger cannot be reduced to generic \u201cout-of-placeness.\u201d\n\n5. Principle Over Panic  \n   \u2022 He does panic (\u201cI just want to g-g-get the hell out of here\u201d), yet the text immediately shows him acting on a principle: refusal of church gambling takings. That is why he says, \u201cNever mind the chips.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Panic may spur him to act, but the nature of the action\u2014a voluntary surrender of winnings\u2014reveals his underlying objection.\n\nConclusion  \nMatheny\u2019s reaction is not mere social discomfort but an explicit moral refusal to accept gambling proceeds from a church. He identifies the contradiction\u2014gambling in a sacred space\u2014and renounces his winnings. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cfelt out of place\u201d account cannot explain why he returns the chips rather than simply fleeing with them. The only coherent reading of the text is that \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to win money from a church.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater A collapses under its own weight. Nowhere does Matheny refuse the chips out of piety\u2014he refuses them because he is mortified, alien, desperate to escape an environment that has blindsided him.\n\n1.  The text emphasizes social embarrassment, not moral scruple.  \n    \u2022 As soon as the dealer hisses, \u201cSir! This is a church!\u201d Matheny\u2019s reaction is visceral: \u201che backed out of the crowd, shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\u201d  \n    \u2022 He doesn\u2019t think \u201cI mustn\u2019t exploit the faithful,\u201d but \u201cI\u2019m humiliated\u2014get me out!\u201d His priority is flight (\u201cI just want to g-g-get the hell out of here\u201d), not issuing a church-funds boycott.\n\n2.  There is no sign of ethical reflection.  \n    \u2022 Matheny never muses on the impropriety of \u201cwinning money from a church.\u201d He doesn\u2019t pause to weigh right and wrong; he literally stumbles backward, tongue-tied.  \n    \u2022 If he were driven by moral conviction, we\u2019d see him articulate it: \u201cI cannot accept what amounts to a collection from the faithful.\u201d Instead he blurts, \u201cNever mind the chips,\u201d purely to exit\u2014a standard sign of an outsider panicking, not a reformer on principle.\n\n3.  The broader narrative paints Matheny as a fish out of water.  \n    \u2022 From his first step on Earth he\u2019s overwhelmed by gravity, crowds, blazing neon, and baffling customs. He\u2019s \u201cgasping at the air,\u201d lost in automated cities, and repeatedly ashamed by his out-of-date clothes and manners.  \n    \u2022 Entering a church gambling parlor is the climax of his alienation. Rejecting the chips is a symptom\u2014he\u2019s still trying to adapt, still shame-facedly seeking a familiar anchor. It has nothing to do with church revenue.\n\nDebater A\u2019s \u201cmoral objection\u201d is invented. Matheny never invokes conscience; he invokes fear and shame. The text says, \u201cHe looked around for some place to hide his burning ears,\u201d and, \u201cI just want to g-g-get the hell out of here.\u201d These are the words of a man overwhelmed by an alien scene\u2014exactly \u201cfeeling out of place.\u201d That is why he didn\u2019t care about the chips.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
