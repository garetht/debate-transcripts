    "background_text": "Planet of No-Return By WILBUR S. PEACOCK The orders were explicit: \"Destroy the\n\n 'THING' of Venus.\" But Patrolmen Kerry\n\n Blane and Splinter Wood, their space-ship\n\n wrecked, could not follow orders\u2014their\n\n weapons were useless on the Water-world.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Old Kerry Blane exploded.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" he roared. \"I don't like you; and I don't like this ship;  and I don't like the assignment; and I don't like those infernal pills  you keep eating; and I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Splinter\" Wood grinned.\n\n\n \"Seems to me, Kerry,\" he remarked humorously, \"that you don't like much  of anything!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane growled unintelligibly, batted the injector lever with a  calloused hand. His grizzled hair was a stiff wiry mop on his small  head, and his oversize jaw was thrust belligerently forward. But deep  within his eyes, where he hoped it was hidden, was a friendly twinkle  that gave the lie to his speech.\n\n\n \"You're a squirt!\" he snapped disagreeably. \"You're not dry behind  the ears, yet. You're like the rest of these kids who call themselves  pilots\u2014only more so! And why the hell the chief had to sic you on me,  on an exploration trip this important\u2014well, I'll never understand.\"\n\n\n Splinter rolled his six foot three of lanky body into a more  comfortable position on the air-bunk. He yawned tremendously, fumbled a  small box from his shirt pocket, and removed a marble-like capsule.\n\n\n \"Better take one of these,\" he warned. \"You're liable to get the space  bends at any moment.\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane snorted, batted the box aside impatiently, scowled  moodily at the capsules that bounced for a moment against the pilot  room's walls before hanging motionless in the air.\n\n\n \"Mister Wood,\" he said icily, \"I was flying a space ship while they  were changing your pants twenty times a day. When I want advice on how  to fly a ship, how to cure space bends, how to handle a Zelta ray, or  how to spit\u2014I'll ask you! Until then, you and your bloody marbles can  go plumb straight to the devil!\"\n\n\n \"Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!\" Splinter reached out lazily, plucked the capsules from  the air, one by one.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit one of the five allotted cigarettes of the day.\n\n\n \"Don't 'tsk' me, you young squirt,\" he grunted around a mouthful of  fragrant smoke. \"I know all the arguments you can put up; ain't that  all I been hearing for a week? You take your vitamins A, B, C, D, all  you want, but you leave me alone\u2014or I'll stuff your head down your  throat, P.D.Q.!\"\n\n\n \"All right, all right!\" Splinter tucked the capsule box back into his  pocket, grinned mockingly. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. With this  shielded ship, and with no sunlight reaching Venus' surface, you're  gonna be begging for some of my vitamin, super-concentrated pills  before we get back to Earth.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane made a rich, ripe noise with his mouth.\n\n\n \"Pfuii!\" he said very distinctly.\n\n\n \"Gracious!\" Splinter said in mock horror. They made a strange contrast as they lay in their air bunks. Splinter  was fully a head taller than the dour Irishman, and his lanky build  gave a false impression of awkwardness. While the vitriolic Kerry Blane  was short and compact, strength and quickness evident in every movement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane had flown every type of ship that rode in space. In the  passing years, he had flight-tested almost every new experimental ship,  had flown them with increasing skill, had earned a reputation as a  trouble shooter on any kind of craft.\n\n\n But even Kerry Blane had to retire eventually.\n\n\n A great retirement banquet had been given in his honor by the  Interplanetary Squadron. There had been the usual speeches and  presentations; and Kerry Blane had heard them all, had thanked the  donors of the gifts. But it was not until the next morning, when he was  dressed in civilian clothes for the first time in forty years, that he  realized the enormity of the thing that had happened to his life.\n\n\n Something died within Kerry Blane's heart that morning, shriveled and  passed away, leaving him suddenly shrunken and old. He had become like  a rusty old freighter couched between the gleaming bodies of great  space warriors.\n\n\n Finally, as a last resort so that he would not be thrown entirely  aside, he had taken a desk job in the squadron offices. For six years  he had dry-rotted there, waiting hopefully for the moment when his  active services would be needed again.\n\n\n It was there that he had met and liked the ungainly Splinter Wood.  There was something in the boy that had found a kindred spirit in Kerry  Blane's heart, and he had taken the youngster in hand to give him the  benefits of experience that had become legendary.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was a probationary pilot, had been admitted to the  Interplanetary Squadron because of his inherent skill, even though his  formal education had been fairly well neglected. Now, the two of them rode the pounding jets of a DX cruiser, bound  for Venus to make a personal survey of its floating islands for the  Interplanetary Squadron's Medical Division.\n\n\n \"Ten to one we don't get back!\" Splinter said pessimistically.\n\n\n Kerry Blane scrubbed out his cigarette, scowled bleakly at the  instrument panel. He sensed the faint thread of fear in the youngster's  tone, and a nostalgic twinge touched his heart, for he was remembering  the days of his youth when he had a full life to look forward to.\n\n\n \"If you're afraid, you can get out and walk back,\" he snapped  disagreeably.\n\n\n A grin lifted the corners of Splinter's long mouth, spread into his  eyes. His hand unconsciously came up, touched the tiny squadron pin on  his lapel.\n\n\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, glory grabber,\" he said mockingly, \"but I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"\n\n\n \" Me! You've got orders to take care of me ?\" Kerry Blane choked  incoherently for a moment, red tiding cholerically upward from his  loosened collar.\n\n\n \"Of course!\" Splinter grinned.\n\n\n Kerry Blane exploded, words spewing volcanically forth. Splinter  relaxed, his booted foot beating out a dull rhythm to the colorful  language learned through almost fifty years of spacing. And at last,  when Kerry Blane had quieted until he but smoldered, he leaned over and  touched the old spacer on the sleeve.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight!\" he remarked pleasantly.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight what?\" Kerry Blane asked sullenly, the old twinkle  beginning to light again deep in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight new words\u2014and you swore them beautifully!\" Splinter  beamed. \"Some day you can teach them to me.\"\n\n\n They laughed then, Old Kerry Blane and young Splinter Wood, and  the warmth of their friendship was a tangible thing in the small  control-room of the cruiser.\n\n\n And in the midst of their laughter, Old Kerry Blane choked in agony,  surged desperately against his bunk straps.\n\n\n He screamed unknowingly, feeling only the horrible excruciating agony  of his body, tasting the blood that gushed from his mouth and nostrils.  His muscles were knotted cords that he could not loosen, and his blood  was a surging stream that pounded at his throbbing temples. The air he  breathed seemed to be molten flame.\n\n\n His body arced again and again against the restraining straps, and his  mouth was open in a soundless scream. He sensed dimly that his partner  had wrenched open a wall door, removed metal medicine kits, and was  fumbling through their contents. He felt the bite of the hypodermic,  felt a deadly numbness replace the raging torment that had been his  for seconds. He swallowed three capsules automatically, passed into a  coma-like sleep, woke hours later to stare clear-eyed into Splinter's  concerned face.\n\n\n \"Close, wasn't it?\" he said weakly, conversationally.\n\n\n \"Close enough!\" Splinter agreed relievedly. \"If you had followed my  advice and taken those vitamin capsules, you'd never have had the  bends.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, winced when he felt the dull ache in his body.\n\n\n \"I've had the bends before, and lived through them!\" he said, still  weakly defiant.\n\n\n \"That's the past,\" Splinter said quietly. \"This is the present, and you  take your pills every day, just as I do\u2014from now on.\"\n\n\n \"All right\u2014and thanks!\"\n\n\n \"Forget it!\" Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\n\n\n A buzzer sounded from the instrument panel, and a tiny light glowed  redly.\n\n\n \"Six hours more,\" Splinter said, turned to the instrument panel.\n\n\n His long hands played over the instrument panel, checking, controlling  the rocket fire, adjusting delicate instruments to hairline marks.  Kerry Blane nodded in silent approval.\n\n\n They could feel the first tug of gravity on their bodies, and through  the vision port could see the greenish ball that was cloud-covered  Venus. Excitement lifted their spirits, brought light to their eyes as  they peered eagerly ahead.\n\n\n \"What's it really like?\" Splinter asked impatiently.\n\n\n Kerry Blane yawned, settled back luxuriously. \"I'll tell you later,\" he  said, \"I'm going to take a nap and try to ease this bellyache of mine.  Wake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky  place to set a ship on.\"\n\n\n He yawned again, drifted instantly into sleep, relaxing with the  ability of a spaceman who sleeps when and if he can. Splinter smiled  down at his sleeping partner, then turned back to the quartzite port.  He shook his head a bit, remembering the stories he had heard about the  water planet, wondering\u2014wondering\u2014 II\n\n\n Venus was a fluffy cotton ball hanging motionless in bottomless  space. Far to the left, Mercury gleamed like a polished diamond in  the sunlight. Kerry Blane cut the driving rockets, let the cruiser  sink into a fast gravity-dive, guiding it only now and then by a brief  flicker of a side jet.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched breathlessly from the vision port, his long face  eager and reckless, his eyes seeking to pierce the clouds that roiled  and twisted uneasily over the surface of the planet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane glanced tolerantly at his young companion, felt a nostalgic  tug at his heart when he remembered the first time he had approached  the water-planet years before. Then, he had been a young and reckless  firebrand, his fame already spreading, an unquenchable fire of  adventure flaming in his heart.\n\n\n Now, his aged but steady fingers rested lightly on the controls,  brought the patrol cruiser closer to the cloud-banks on the line of  demarcation between the sunward and sunless sides of the planet. He  hummed tunelessly, strangely happy, as he peered ahead.\n\n\n \"Val Kenton died there,\" Splinter whispered softly, \"Died to save the  lives of three other people!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, and his voice changed subtly.  \"Val was a blackguard, a criminal; but he died in the best traditions  of the service.\" He sighed. \"He never had a chance.\"\n\n\n \"Murdered!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane smiled grimly. \"I guess I used too broad an interpretation  of the word,\" he said gently. \"Anyway, one of our main tasks is to  destroy the thing that killed him.\"\n\n\n His lean fingers tightened unconsciously.\n\n\n \"I'd like nothing better than to turn a Zelta-blaster on that chunk of  living protoplasm and cremate it.\"\n\n\n Splinters shivered slightly. \"Do you think we'll find it?\" he asked.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"I think it will find us; after all, it's just an  animated appetite looking for food.\"\n\n\n He turned back to the controls, flipped a switch, and the cutting of  the nose rocket dropped the ship in an angling glide toward the clouds  a few miles below. Gravity was full strength now, and although not as  great as Earth's, was still strong enough to bring a sense of giddiness  to the men.\n\n\n \"Here we go!\" Splinter said tonelessly.\n\n\n The great cottony batts of roiling clouds rushed up to meet the ship,  bringing the first sense of violent movement in more than a week of  flying. There was something awesome and breath-taking in the speed with  which the ship dropped toward the planet.\n\n\n Tendrils of vapor touched the ports, were whipped aside, then were  replaced by heavier fingers of cloud. Kerry Blane pressed a firing  stud, and nose rockets thrummed in a rising crescendo as the free fall  of the cruiser was checked. Heat rose in the cabin from the friction of  the outer air, then dissipated, as the force-screen voltometer leaped  higher.\n\n\n Then, as though it had never been, the sun disappeared, and there was  only a gray blankness pressing about the ship. Gone was all sense of  movement, and the ship seemed to hover in a gray nothingness.\n\n\n Kerry Blane crouched over the control panel, his hands moving deftly,  his eyes flicking from one instrument to another. Tiny lines of  concentration etched themselves about his mouth, and perspiration  beaded his forehead. He rode that cruiser through the miles of clouds  through sheer instinctive ability, seeming to fly it as though he were  an integral part of the ship.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched him with awe in his eyes, seeing for the first  time the incredible instinct that had made Kerry Blane the idol of a  billion people. He relaxed visibly, all instinctive fear allayed by the  brilliant competence of his companion.\n\n\n Seconds flowed into moments, and the moments merged into one another,  and still the clouds pressed with a visible strength against the  ports. The rockets drummed steadily, holding the ship aloft, dropping  it slowly toward the planet below. Then the clouds thinned, and,  incredibly, were permeated with a dim and glowing light. A second  later, and the clouds were gone, and a thousand feet below tumbled and  tossed in a majestic display of ruthless strength an ocean that seemed  to be composed of liquid fluorescence.\n\n\n Kerry Blane heard Splinter's instant sigh of unbelief.\n\n\n \"Good Lord!\" Splinter said, \"What\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice stilled, and he was silent, his eyes drinking in the weird  incredible scene below. The ocean was a shifting, white-capped wash of silvery light that  gleamed with a bright phosphorescence of a hundred, intermingled,  kaleidoscopic colors. And the unreal, unearthly light continued  unbroken everywhere, reflected from the low-hanging clouds, reaching  to the far horizon, bathing every detail of the planet in a brilliance  more bright than moonlight.\n\n\n Splinter turned a wondering face. \"But the official reports say that  there is no light on Venus,\" he exclaimed. \"That was one of the reasons  given when exploration was forbidden!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"That was merely a pretext to keep foolhardy  spacemen from losing their lives on the planet. In reality, the  ocean is alive with an incredibly tiny marine worm that glows  phosphorescently. The light generated from those billions of worms is  reflected back from the clouds, makes Venus eternally lighted.\"\n\n\n He turned the ship to the North, relaxed a bit on the air bunk. He  felt tired and worn, his body aching from the space bends of a few  hours before.\n\n\n \"Take over,\" he said wearily. \"Take the ship North, and watch for any  island.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, rested his long hands on the controls. The space  cruiser lifted a bit in a sudden spurt of speed, and the rocket-sound  was a solid thrum of unleashed power.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit a cigarette, leaned toward a vision port. He felt again  that thrill he had experienced when he had first flashed his single-man  cruiser through the clouds years before. Then the breath caught in his  throat, and he tapped his companion's arm.\n\n\n \"Take a look!\" he called excitedly.\n\n\n They fought in the ocean below, fought in a never-ending splashing of  what seemed to be liquid fire. It was like watching a tri-dim screen of  a news event, except for the utter lack of sound.\n\n\n One was scaly, while the other was skinned, and both were fully three  hundred feet long. Great scimitars of teeth flashed in the light, and  blood gouted and stained the water crimson whenever a slashing blow was  struck. They threshed in a mad paroxysm of rage, whirling and spinning  in the phosphorescent water like beings from a nightmare, exploding  out of their element time and again, only to fall back in a gargantuan  spray of fluorescence.\n\n\n And then the scaly monster flashed in a half-turn, drove forward with  jaws agape, wrenched and ripped at the smooth black throat of the other  creature. The second creature rippled and undulated in agony, whipping  the ocean to foam, then went limp. The victorious monster circled the  body of its dead foe, then, majestically, plunged from sight into the  ocean's depths. An instant later, the water frothed, as hundreds of  lesser marine monsters attacked and fed on the floating corpse.\n\n\n \"Brrrr!\" Splinter shivered in sudden horror.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled dryly. \"Feel like going for a swim?\" he asked  conversationally.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head, watched the scene disappear from view to the  rear of the line of flight, then sank back onto his bunk.\n\n\n \"Not me!\" he said deprecatingly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled again, swung the cruiser toward the tiny smudge of  black on the horizon. Glowing water flashed beneath the ship, seeming  to smooth into a gleaming mirror shot with dancing colors. There was no  sign of life anywhere.\n\n\n Thirty minutes later, Kerry Blane circled the island that floated  free in the phosphorescent ocean. His keen eyes searched the tangled  luxuriant growth of the jungle below, searching for some indication  that the protoplasmic monster he seeked was there.\n\n\n \"I don't see anything suspicious,\" Splinter contributed.\n\n\n \"There's nothing special to see,\" Kerry Blane said shortly. \"As I  understand it, anyway, this chunk of animated appetite hangs around an  island shaped like a turtle. However, our orders are to investigate  every island, just in case there might be more than one of the  monsters.\"\n\n\n Splinter buckled on his dis-gun, excitement flaring in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Let's do a little exploring?\" he said eagerly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane shook his head, swung the cruiser north again.\n\n\n \"Plenty of time for that later,\" he said mildly. \"We'll find this  turtle-island, make a landing, and take a look around. Later, if we're  lucky enough to blow our objective to Kingdom Come, we'll do a little  exploring of the other islands.\"\n\n\n \"Hell!\" Splinter scowled in mock disgust. \"An old woman like you should  be taking in knitting for a living!\"\n\n\n \"Orders are orders!\" Kerry Blane shrugged. He swung the cruiser in a wide arc to the north, trebling the flying  speed within minutes, handling the controls with a familiar dexterity.  He said nothing, searched the gleaming ocean for the smudge of  blackness that would denote another island. His gaze flicked amusedly,  now and then, to the lanky Splinter who scowled moodily and toyed with  the dis-gun in his long hands.\n\n\n \"Cheer up, lad,\" Kerry Blane said finally. \"I think you'll find plenty  to occupy your time shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe?\" Splinter said gloomily.\n\n\n He idly swallowed another vitamin capsule, grinned, when he saw Kerry  Blane's automatic grimace of distaste. Then he yawned hugely, twisted  into a comfortable position, dozed sleepily.\n\n\n Kerry Blane rode the controls for the next three hours, searching the  limitless ocean for the few specks of islands that followed the slow  currents of the water planet. Always, there was the same misty light  surrounding the ship, never dimming, giving a sense of unreality to the  scene below. Nowhere was there the slightest sign of life until, in the  fourth hour of flight, a tiny dot of blackness came slowly over the  horizon's water line.\n\n\n Kerry Blane spun the ship in a tight circle, sent it flashing to the  west. His keen eyes lighted, when he finally made out the turtle-like  outline of the island, and he whistled softly, off-key, as he nudged  the snoring Splinter.\n\n\n \"This is it, Sleeping Beauty,\" he called. \"Snap out of it!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Whuzzat?\" Splinter grunted, rolled to his elbow.\n\n\n \"Here's the island.\"\n\n\n \"Oh!\" Splinter swung his feet from the bunk, peered from the vision  port, sleepiness instantly erased from his face.\n\n\n \"Hot damn!\" he chortled. \"Now we'll see a little action!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, tried to conceal the excitement he felt. He shook  his head, his fingers flickering over the control studs.\n\n\n \"Don't get your hopes too high, lad,\" he counseled. \"With those super  Zelta guns, it won't take ten minutes to wipe out that monster.\"\n\n\n Splinter rubbed his hands together, sighed like a boy seeing his first  circus. \"Listen, for ten minutes of that, I'd ride this chunk of metal  for a year!\"\n\n\n \"Could be!\" Kerry Blane agreed.\n\n\n He peered through the port, seeking any spot clear enough for a landing  field. Except for a strip of open beach, the island was a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n\n\n \"Belt yourself,\" Kerry Blane warned. \"If that beach isn't solid, I'll  have to lift the ship in a hell of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter's fingers were all thumbs in his excitement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane set the controls for a shallow glide, his fingers moving  like a concert pianist's. The cruiser yawed slightly, settled slowly  in a flat shallow glide.\n\n\n \"We're going in,\" Kerry Blane said quietly.\n\n\n He closed a knife switch, seeing too late the vitamin capsule that was  lodged in the slot. There was the sharp splutter of a short-circuit,  and a thin tendril of smoke drifted upward.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" Kerry Blane swore briefly.\n\n\n There was an instant, terrific explosion of the stern jets, and the  cruiser hurtled toward the beach like a gravity-crazed comet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane said absolutely nothing, his breath driven from him by the  suck of inertia. His hands darted for the controls, seeking to balance  the forces that threw the ship about like a toy. He cut all rockets  with a smashing swoop of his hand, tried to fire the bow rockets. But  the short had ruined the entire control system.\n\n\n For one interminable second, he saw the uncanny uprush of the island  below. He flicked his gaze about, saw the instant terror that wiped  all other expression from his young companion's face. Then the cruiser  plowed into the silvery sand.\n\n\n Belts parted like rotten string; they were thrown forward with crushing  force against the control panel. They groped feebly for support, their  bodies twisting involuntarily, as the ship cartwheeled a dozen times in  a few seconds. Almost instantly, consciousness was battered from them.\n\n\n With one final, grinding bounce, the cruiser rolled to its side,  twisted over and over for a hundred yards, then came to a metal-ripping  stop against a moss-grown boulder at the water's edge. III\n\n\n Kerry Blane choked, tried to turn his head from the water that trickled  into his face. He opened his eyes, stared blankly, uncomprehendingly  into the bloody features of the man bending over him.\n\n\n \"What happened?\" he gasped.\n\n\n Splinter Wood laughed, almost hysterically, mopped at his forehead with  a wet handkerchief.\n\n\n \"I thought you were dead!\" he said simply.\n\n\n Kerry Blane moved his arm experimentally, felt broken bones grate in  an exquisite wave of pain. He fought back the nausea, gazed about the  cabin, realized the ship lay on its side.\n\n\n \"Maybe I am,\" he said ruefully. \"No man could live through that crash.\"\n\n\n Splinter moved away, sat down tiredly on the edge of a bunk. He shook  his head dazedly, inspected the long cut on his leg.\n\n\n \"We seem to have done it,\" he said dully.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded, clambered to his feet, favoring his broken arm.  He leaned over the control panel, inspecting the dials with a worried  gaze. Slowly, his eyes lightened, and his voice was almost cheerful as  he swung about.\n\n\n \"Everything is more or less okay,\" he said. \"The board will have to  be rewired, but nothing else seems to be damaged so that repairs are  needed.\"\n\n\n Splinter looked up from his task of bandaging his leg. \"What caused  the crash?\" he asked. \"One minute, everything was all right; the next,  Blooey!\"\n\n\n Anger suddenly mottled Kerry Blane's face; he swore monotonously and  bitterly for a moment.\n\n\n \"Those gol-damned pills you been taking caused the crash!\" he roared.  \"One of them broke and shorted out the control board.\" He scowled at  the incredulous Splinter. \"By the three tails of a Martian sand-pup, I  ought to cram the rest of them down your throat, boxes and all!\"\n\n\n Splinter flushed, seemed to be fumbling for words. After a bit, Kerry  Blane grinned.\n\n\n \"Forget it, lad,\" he said more kindly, \"those things happen. Now, if  you'll bind a splint about my arm, we'll see what we can do about  righting the ship.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, opened the medical locker, worked with tape and  splints for minutes. Great beads of perspiration stood out in high  relief on Kerry Blane's forehead, but he made no sound. At last,  Splinter finished, tucked the supplies away.\n\n\n \"Now what?\" he asked subduedly.\n\n\n \"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. Can't tell but  what that protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit  in the near future!\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter unscrewed the port cogs, swung the portal back.\n\n\n He swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the  older man. After much puffing and grunting, Kerry Blane managed to  clamber through the port. They stood for a moment in silent wonder,  staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled  endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like  trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\n\n\n \"How big do you feel now?\" Kerry Blane asked quietly.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was silent, awed by the beauty and the tremendous size of  the growths on the water world.\n\n\n Kerry Blane walked the length of the cruiser, examining the slight  damage done by the crash, evaluating the situation with a practiced  gaze. He nodded slowly, retraced his steps, and stood looking at the  furrow plowed in the sand.\n\n\n \"Won't be any trouble at all to lift the ship,\" he called. \"After  rewiring the board, we'll turn the ship with an underjet, swing it  about, and head her toward the sea.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, dropped into the open port. A moment later, he flipped  a rope ladder outside, where it dangled to the ground, then climbed out  himself, carrying the two Zelta guns.\n\n\n \"We'd better test these,\" he said. \"We don't want any slip-ups when we  do go into action.\"\n\n\n He climbed down the ladder, laid the guns aside, then reached up a  hand to aid Kerry Blane's descent. Kerry Blane came down slowly and  awkwardly, jumped the last few feet. He felt surprisingly light and  strong in the lesser gravity.\n\n\n He stood, leaning against the ship, watching as Splinter picked up  the first gun and leveled it at a gigantic tree. Splinter sighted  carefully, winked at the older man, then pressed the firing stud.\n\n\n Nothing happened; there was no hissing crackle of released energy.\n\n\n Kerry Blane strode forward, puzzlement on his lined face, his hand  out-stretched toward the defective weapon. Splinter gaped at the gun in  his hands, held it out wordlessly.\n\n\n \"The crash must have broken something,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head. \"There's only one moving part,\" he said, \"and  that's the force gate on the firing stud.\"\n\n\n \"Try the other,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n \"Okay!\"\n\n\n Splinter lifted the second gun, pressed the stud, gazed white-faced at  his companion.\n\n\n \"It won't work, either,\" he said stupidly. \"I don't get it? The source  of power is limitless. Solar rays never\u2014\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane dropped the first gun to his side, swore harshly.\n\n\n \"Damn it,\" he said. \"They didn't think of it; you didn't think of it;  and I most certainly forgot! Solar rays can't penetrate the miles of  clouds on Venus. Those guns are utterly useless as weapons!\" ",

PEACOCK The orders were explicit: \"Destroy the\n\n 'THING' of Venus.\" But Patrolmen Kerry\n\n Blane and Splinter Wood, their space-ship\n\n wrecked, could not follow orders\u2014their\n\n weapons were useless on the Water-world.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Old Kerry Blane exploded.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" he roared. \"I don't like you; and I don't like this ship;  and I don't like the assignment; and I don't like those infernal pills  you keep eating; and I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Splinter\" Wood grinned.\n\n\n \"Seems to me, Kerry,\" he remarked humorously, \"that you don't like much  of anything!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane growled unintelligibly, batted the injector lever with a  calloused hand. His grizzled hair was a stiff wiry mop on his small  head, and his oversize jaw was thrust belligerently forward. But deep  within his eyes, where he hoped it was hidden, was a friendly twinkle  that gave the lie to his speech.\n\n\n \"You're a squirt!\" he snapped disagreeably. \"You're not dry behind  the ears, yet. You're like the rest of these kids who call themselves  pilots\u2014only more so! And why the hell the chief had to sic you on me,  on an exploration trip this important\u2014well, I'll never understand.\"\n\n\n Splinter rolled his six foot three of lanky body into a more  comfortable position on the air-bunk. He yawned tremendously, fumbled a  small box from his shirt pocket, and removed a marble-like capsule.\n\n\n \"Better take one of these,\" he warned. \"You're liable to get the space  bends at any moment.\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane snorted, batted the box aside impatiently, scowled  moodily at the capsules that bounced for a moment against the pilot  room's walls before hanging motionless in the air.\n\n\n \"Mister Wood,\" he said icily, \"I was flying a space ship while they  were changing your pants twenty times a day. When I want advice on how  to fly a ship, how to cure space bends, how to handle a Zelta ray, or  how to spit\u2014I'll ask you! Until then, you and your bloody marbles can  go plumb straight to the devil!\"\n\n\n \"Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!\" Splinter reached out lazily, plucked the capsules from  the air, one by one.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit one of the five allotted cigarettes of the day.\n\n\n \"Don't 'tsk' me, you young squirt,\" he grunted around a mouthful of  fragrant smoke. \"I know all the arguments you can put up; ain't that  all I been hearing for a week? You take your vitamins A, B, C, D, all  you want, but you leave me alone\u2014or I'll stuff your head down your  throat, P.D.Q.!\"\n\n\n \"All right, all right!\" Splinter tucked the capsule box back into his  pocket, grinned mockingly. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. With this  shielded ship, and with no sunlight reaching Venus' surface, you're  gonna be begging for some of my vitamin, super-concentrated pills  before we get back to Earth.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane made a rich, ripe noise with his mouth.\n\n\n \"Pfuii!\" he said very distinctly.\n\n\n \"Gracious!\" Splinter said in mock horror. They made a strange contrast as they lay in their air bunks. Splinter  was fully a head taller than the dour Irishman, and his lanky build  gave a false impression of awkwardness. While the vitriolic Kerry Blane  was short and compact, strength and quickness evident in every movement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane had flown every type of ship that rode in space. In the  passing years, he had flight-tested almost every new experimental ship,  had flown them with increasing skill, had earned a reputation as a  trouble shooter on any kind of craft.\n\n\n But even Kerry Blane had to retire eventually.\n\n\n A great retirement banquet had been given in his honor by the  Interplanetary Squadron. There had been the usual speeches and  presentations; and Kerry Blane had heard them all, had thanked the  donors of the gifts. But it was not until the next morning, when he was  dressed in civilian clothes for the first time in forty years, that he  realized the enormity of the thing that had happened to his life.\n\n\n Something died within Kerry Blane's heart that morning, shriveled and  passed away, leaving him suddenly shrunken and old. He had become like  a rusty old freighter couched between the gleaming bodies of great  space warriors.\n\n\n Finally, as a last resort so that he would not be thrown entirely  aside, he had taken a desk job in the squadron offices. For six years  he had dry-rotted there, waiting hopefully for the moment when his  active services would be needed again.\n\n\n It was there that he had met and liked the ungainly Splinter Wood.  There was something in the boy that had found a kindred spirit in Kerry  Blane's heart, and he had taken the youngster in hand to give him the  benefits of experience that had become legendary.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was a probationary pilot, had been admitted to the  Interplanetary Squadron because of his inherent skill, even though his  formal education had been fairly well neglected. Now, the two of them rode the pounding jets of a DX cruiser, bound  for Venus to make a personal survey of its floating islands for the  Interplanetary Squadron's Medical Division.\n\n\n \"Ten to one we don't get back!\" Splinter said pessimistically.\n\n\n Kerry Blane scrubbed out his cigarette, scowled bleakly at the  instrument panel. He sensed the faint thread of fear in the youngster's  tone, and a nostalgic twinge touched his heart, for he was remembering  the days of his youth when he had a full life to look forward to.\n\n\n \"If you're afraid, you can get out and walk back,\" he snapped  disagreeably.\n\n\n A grin lifted the corners of Splinter's long mouth, spread into his  eyes. His hand unconsciously came up, touched the tiny squadron pin on  his lapel.\n\n\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, glory grabber,\" he said mockingly, \"but I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"\n\n\n \" Me! You've got orders to take care of me ?\" Kerry Blane choked  incoherently for a moment, red tiding cholerically upward from his  loosened collar.\n\n\n \"Of course!\" Splinter grinned.\n\n\n Kerry Blane exploded, words spewing volcanically forth. Splinter  relaxed, his booted foot beating out a dull rhythm to the colorful  language learned through almost fifty years of spacing. And at last,  when Kerry Blane had quieted until he but smoldered, he leaned over and  touched the old spacer on the sleeve.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight!\" he remarked pleasantly.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight what?\" Kerry Blane asked sullenly, the old twinkle  beginning to light again deep in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight new words\u2014and you swore them beautifully!\" Splinter  beamed. \"Some day you can teach them to me.\"\n\n\n They laughed then, Old Kerry Blane and young Splinter Wood, and  the warmth of their friendship was a tangible thing in the small  control-room of the cruiser.\n\n\n And in the midst of their laughter, Old Kerry Blane choked in agony,  surged desperately against his bunk straps.\n\n\n He screamed unknowingly, feeling only the horrible excruciating agony  of his body, tasting the blood that gushed from his mouth and nostrils.  His muscles were knotted cords that he could not loosen, and his blood  was a surging stream that pounded at his throbbing temples. The air he  breathed seemed to be molten flame.\n\n\n His body arced again and again against the restraining straps, and his  mouth was open in a soundless scream. He sensed dimly that his partner  had wrenched open a wall door, removed metal medicine kits, and was  fumbling through their contents. He felt the bite of the hypodermic,  felt a deadly numbness replace the raging torment that had been his  for seconds. He swallowed three capsules automatically, passed into a  coma-like sleep, woke hours later to stare clear-eyed into Splinter's  concerned face.\n\n\n \"Close, wasn't it?\" he said weakly, conversationally.\n\n\n \"Close enough!\" Splinter agreed relievedly. \"If you had followed my  advice and taken those vitamin capsules, you'd never have had the  bends.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, winced when he felt the dull ache in his body.\n\n\n \"I've had the bends before, and lived through them!\" he said, still  weakly defiant.\n\n\n \"That's the past,\" Splinter said quietly. \"This is the present, and you  take your pills every day, just as I do\u2014from now on.\"\n\n\n \"All right\u2014and thanks!\"\n\n\n \"Forget it!\" Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\n\n\n A buzzer sounded from the instrument panel, and a tiny light glowed  redly.\n\n\n \"Six hours more,\" Splinter said, turned to the instrument panel.\n\n\n His long hands played over the instrument panel, checking, controlling  the rocket fire, adjusting delicate instruments to hairline marks.  Kerry Blane nodded in silent approval.\n\n\n They could feel the first tug of gravity on their bodies, and through  the vision port could see the greenish ball that was cloud-covered  Venus. Excitement lifted their spirits, brought light to their eyes as  they peered eagerly ahead.\n\n\n \"What's it really like?\" Splinter asked impatiently.\n\n\n Kerry Blane yawned, settled back luxuriously. \"I'll tell you later,\" he  said, \"I'm going to take a nap and try to ease this bellyache of mine.  Wake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky  place to set a ship on.\"\n\n\n He yawned again, drifted instantly into sleep, relaxing with the  ability of a spaceman who sleeps when and if he can. Splinter smiled  down at his sleeping partner, then turned back to the quartzite port.  He shook his head a bit, remembering the stories he had heard about the  water planet, wondering\u2014wondering\u2014 II\n\n\n Venus was a fluffy cotton ball hanging motionless in bottomless  space. Far to the left, Mercury gleamed like a polished diamond in  the sunlight. Kerry Blane cut the driving rockets, let the cruiser  sink into a fast gravity-dive, guiding it only now and then by a brief  flicker of a side jet.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched breathlessly from the vision port, his long face  eager and reckless, his eyes seeking to pierce the clouds that roiled  and twisted uneasily over the surface of the planet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane glanced tolerantly at his young companion, felt a nostalgic  tug at his heart when he remembered the first time he had approached  the water-planet years before. Then, he had been a young and reckless  firebrand, his fame already spreading, an unquenchable fire of  adventure flaming in his heart.\n\n\n Now, his aged but steady fingers rested lightly on the controls,  brought the patrol cruiser closer to the cloud-banks on the line of  demarcation between the sunward and sunless sides of the planet. He  hummed tunelessly, strangely happy, as he peered ahead.\n\n\n \"Val Kenton died there,\" Splinter whispered softly, \"Died to save the  lives of three other people!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, and his voice changed subtly.  \"Val was a blackguard, a criminal; but he died in the best traditions  of the service.\" He sighed. \"He never had a chance.\"\n\n\n \"Murdered!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane smiled grimly. \"I guess I used too broad an interpretation  of the word,\" he said gently. \"Anyway, one of our main tasks is to  destroy the thing that killed him.\"\n\n\n His lean fingers tightened unconsciously.\n\n\n \"I'd like nothing better than to turn a Zelta-blaster on that chunk of  living protoplasm and cremate it.\"\n\n\n Splinters shivered slightly. \"Do you think we'll find it?\" he asked.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"I think it will find us; after all, it's just an  animated appetite looking for food.\"\n\n\n He turned back to the controls, flipped a switch, and the cutting of  the nose rocket dropped the ship in an angling glide toward the clouds  a few miles below. Gravity was full strength now, and although not as  great as Earth's, was still strong enough to bring a sense of giddiness  to the men.\n\n\n \"Here we go!\" Splinter said tonelessly.\n\n\n The great cottony batts of roiling clouds rushed up to meet the ship,  bringing the first sense of violent movement in more than a week of  flying. There was something awesome and breath-taking in the speed with  which the ship dropped toward the planet.\n\n\n Tendrils of vapor touched the ports, were whipped aside, then were  replaced by heavier fingers of cloud. Kerry Blane pressed a firing  stud, and nose rockets thrummed in a rising crescendo as the free fall  of the cruiser was checked. Heat rose in the cabin from the friction of  the outer air, then dissipated, as the force-screen voltometer leaped  higher.\n\n\n Then, as though it had never been, the sun disappeared, and there was  only a gray blankness pressing about the ship. Gone was all sense of  movement, and the ship seemed to hover in a gray nothingness.\n\n\n Kerry Blane crouched over the control panel, his hands moving deftly,  his eyes flicking from one instrument to another. Tiny lines of  concentration etched themselves about his mouth, and perspiration  beaded his forehead. He rode that cruiser through the miles of clouds  through sheer instinctive ability, seeming to fly it as though he were  an integral part of the ship.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched him with awe in his eyes, seeing for the first  time the incredible instinct that had made Kerry Blane the idol of a  billion people. He relaxed visibly, all instinctive fear allayed by the  brilliant competence of his companion.\n\n\n Seconds flowed into moments, and the moments merged into one another,  and still the clouds pressed with a visible strength against the  ports. The rockets drummed steadily, holding the ship aloft, dropping  it slowly toward the planet below. Then the clouds thinned, and,  incredibly, were permeated with a dim and glowing light. A second  later, and the clouds were gone, and a thousand feet below tumbled and  tossed in a majestic display of ruthless strength an ocean that seemed  to be composed of liquid fluorescence.\n\n\n Kerry Blane heard Splinter's instant sigh of unbelief.\n\n\n \"Good Lord!\" Splinter said, \"What\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice stilled, and he was silent, his eyes drinking in the weird  incredible scene below. The ocean was a shifting, white-capped wash of silvery light that  gleamed with a bright phosphorescence of a hundred, intermingled,  kaleidoscopic colors. And the unreal, unearthly light continued  unbroken everywhere, reflected from the low-hanging clouds, reaching  to the far horizon, bathing every detail of the planet in a brilliance  more bright than moonlight.\n\n\n Splinter turned a wondering face. \"But the official reports say that  there is no light on Venus,\" he exclaimed. \"That was one of the reasons  given when exploration was forbidden!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"That was merely a pretext to keep foolhardy  spacemen from losing their lives on the planet. In reality, the  ocean is alive with an incredibly tiny marine worm that glows  phosphorescently. The light generated from those billions of worms is  reflected back from the clouds, makes Venus eternally lighted.\"\n\n\n He turned the ship to the North, relaxed a bit on the air bunk. He  felt tired and worn, his body aching from the space bends of a few  hours before.\n\n\n \"Take over,\" he said wearily. \"Take the ship North, and watch for any  island.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, rested his long hands on the controls. The space  cruiser lifted a bit in a sudden spurt of speed, and the rocket-sound  was a solid thrum of unleashed power.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit a cigarette, leaned toward a vision port. He felt again  that thrill he had experienced when he had first flashed his single-man  cruiser through the clouds years before. Then the breath caught in his  throat, and he tapped his companion's arm.\n\n\n \"Take a look!\" he called excitedly.\n\n\n They fought in the ocean below, fought in a never-ending splashing of  what seemed to be liquid fire. It was like watching a tri-dim screen of  a news event, except for the utter lack of sound.\n\n\n One was scaly, while the other was skinned, and both were fully three  hundred feet long. Great scimitars of teeth flashed in the light, and  blood gouted and stained the water crimson whenever a slashing blow was  struck. They threshed in a mad paroxysm of rage, whirling and spinning  in the phosphorescent water like beings from a nightmare, exploding  out of their element time and again, only to fall back in a gargantuan  spray of fluorescence.\n\n\n And then the scaly monster flashed in a half-turn, drove forward with  jaws agape, wrenched and ripped at the smooth black throat of the other  creature. The second creature rippled and undulated in agony, whipping  the ocean to foam, then went limp. The victorious monster circled the  body of its dead foe, then, majestically, plunged from sight into the  ocean's depths. An instant later, the water frothed, as hundreds of  lesser marine monsters attacked and fed on the floating corpse.\n\n\n \"Brrrr!\" Splinter shivered in sudden horror.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled dryly. \"Feel like going for a swim?\" he asked  conversationally.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head, watched the scene disappear from view to the  rear of the line of flight, then sank back onto his bunk.\n\n\n \"Not me!\" he said deprecatingly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled again, swung the cruiser toward the tiny smudge of  black on the horizon. Glowing water flashed beneath the ship, seeming  to smooth into a gleaming mirror shot with dancing colors. There was no  sign of life anywhere.\n\n\n Thirty minutes later, Kerry Blane circled the island that floated  free in the phosphorescent ocean. His keen eyes searched the tangled  luxuriant growth of the jungle below, searching for some indication  that the protoplasmic monster he seeked was there.\n\n\n \"I don't see anything suspicious,\" Splinter contributed.\n\n\n \"There's nothing special to see,\" Kerry Blane said shortly. \"As I  understand it, anyway, this chunk of animated appetite hangs around an  island shaped like a turtle. However, our orders are to investigate  every island, just in case there might be more than one of the  monsters.\"\n\n\n Splinter buckled on his dis-gun, excitement flaring in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Let's do a little exploring?\" he said eagerly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane shook his head, swung the cruiser north again.\n\n\n \"Plenty of time for that later,\" he said mildly. \"We'll find this  turtle-island, make a landing, and take a look around. Later, if we're  lucky enough to blow our objective to Kingdom Come, we'll do a little  exploring of the other islands.\"\n\n\n \"Hell!\" Splinter scowled in mock disgust. \"An old woman like you should  be taking in knitting for a living!\"\n\n\n \"Orders are orders!\" Kerry Blane shrugged. He swung the cruiser in a wide arc to the north, trebling the flying  speed within minutes, handling the controls with a familiar dexterity.  He said nothing, searched the gleaming ocean for the smudge of  blackness that would denote another island. His gaze flicked amusedly,  now and then, to the lanky Splinter who scowled moodily and toyed with  the dis-gun in his long hands.\n\n\n \"Cheer up, lad,\" Kerry Blane said finally. \"I think you'll find plenty  to occupy your time shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe?\" Splinter said gloomily.\n\n\n He idly swallowed another vitamin capsule, grinned, when he saw Kerry  Blane's automatic grimace of distaste. Then he yawned hugely, twisted  into a comfortable position, dozed sleepily.\n\n\n Kerry Blane rode the controls for the next three hours, searching the  limitless ocean for the few specks of islands that followed the slow  currents of the water planet. Always, there was the same misty light  surrounding the ship, never dimming, giving a sense of unreality to the  scene below. Nowhere was there the slightest sign of life until, in the  fourth hour of flight, a tiny dot of blackness came slowly over the  horizon's water line.\n\n\n Kerry Blane spun the ship in a tight circle, sent it flashing to the  west. His keen eyes lighted, when he finally made out the turtle-like  outline of the island, and he whistled softly, off-key, as he nudged  the snoring Splinter.\n\n\n \"This is it, Sleeping Beauty,\" he called. \"Snap out of it!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Whuzzat?\" Splinter grunted, rolled to his elbow.\n\n\n \"Here's the island.\"\n\n\n \"Oh!\" Splinter swung his feet from the bunk, peered from the vision  port, sleepiness instantly erased from his face.\n\n\n \"Hot damn!\" he chortled. \"Now we'll see a little action!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, tried to conceal the excitement he felt. He shook  his head, his fingers flickering over the control studs.\n\n\n \"Don't get your hopes too high, lad,\" he counseled. \"With those super  Zelta guns, it won't take ten minutes to wipe out that monster.\"\n\n\n Splinter rubbed his hands together, sighed like a boy seeing his first  circus. \"Listen, for ten minutes of that, I'd ride this chunk of metal  for a year!\"\n\n\n \"Could be!\" Kerry Blane agreed.\n\n\n He peered through the port, seeking any spot clear enough for a landing  field. Except for a strip of open beach, the island was a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n\n\n \"Belt yourself,\" Kerry Blane warned. \"If that beach isn't solid, I'll  have to lift the ship in a hell of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter's fingers were all thumbs in his excitement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane set the controls for a shallow glide, his fingers moving  like a concert pianist's. The cruiser yawed slightly, settled slowly  in a flat shallow glide.\n\n\n \"We're going in,\" Kerry Blane said quietly.\n\n\n He closed a knife switch, seeing too late the vitamin capsule that was  lodged in the slot. There was the sharp splutter of a short-circuit,  and a thin tendril of smoke drifted upward.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" Kerry Blane swore briefly.\n\n\n There was an instant, terrific explosion of the stern jets, and the  cruiser hurtled toward the beach like a gravity-crazed comet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane said absolutely nothing, his breath driven from him by the  suck of inertia. His hands darted for the controls, seeking to balance  the forces that threw the ship about like a toy. He cut all rockets  with a smashing swoop of his hand, tried to fire the bow rockets. But  the short had ruined the entire control system.\n\n\n For one interminable second, he saw the uncanny uprush of the island  below. He flicked his gaze about, saw the instant terror that wiped  all other expression from his young companion's face. Then the cruiser  plowed into the silvery sand.\n\n\n Belts parted like rotten string; they were thrown forward with crushing  force against the control panel. They groped feebly for support, their  bodies twisting involuntarily, as the ship cartwheeled a dozen times in  a few seconds. Almost instantly, consciousness was battered from them.\n\n\n With one final, grinding bounce, the cruiser rolled to its side,  twisted over and over for a hundred yards, then came to a metal-ripping  stop against a moss-grown boulder at the water's edge. III\n\n\n Kerry Blane choked, tried to turn his head from the water that trickled  into his face. He opened his eyes, stared blankly, uncomprehendingly  into the bloody features of the man bending over him.\n\n\n \"What happened?\" he gasped.\n\n\n Splinter Wood laughed, almost hysterically, mopped at his forehead with  a wet handkerchief.\n\n\n \"I thought you were dead!\" he said simply.\n\n\n Kerry Blane moved his arm experimentally, felt broken bones grate in  an exquisite wave of pain. He fought back the nausea, gazed about the  cabin, realized the ship lay on its side.\n\n\n \"Maybe I am,\" he said ruefully. \"No man could live through that crash.\"\n\n\n Splinter moved away, sat down tiredly on the edge of a bunk. He shook  his head dazedly, inspected the long cut on his leg.\n\n\n \"We seem to have done it,\" he said dully.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded, clambered to his feet, favoring his broken arm.  He leaned over the control panel, inspecting the dials with a worried  gaze. Slowly, his eyes lightened, and his voice was almost cheerful as  he swung about.\n\n\n \"Everything is more or less okay,\" he said. \"The board will have to  be rewired, but nothing else seems to be damaged so that repairs are  needed.\"\n\n\n Splinter looked up from his task of bandaging his leg. \"What caused  the crash?\" he asked. \"One minute, everything was all right; the next,  Blooey!\"\n\n\n Anger suddenly mottled Kerry Blane's face; he swore monotonously and  bitterly for a moment.\n\n\n \"Those gol-damned pills you been taking caused the crash!\" he roared.  \"One of them broke and shorted out the control board.\" He scowled at  the incredulous Splinter. \"By the three tails of a Martian sand-pup, I  ought to cram the rest of them down your throat, boxes and all!\"\n\n\n Splinter flushed, seemed to be fumbling for words. After a bit, Kerry  Blane grinned.\n\n\n \"Forget it, lad,\" he said more kindly, \"those things happen. Now, if  you'll bind a splint about my arm, we'll see what we can do about  righting the ship.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, opened the medical locker, worked with tape and  splints for minutes. Great beads of perspiration stood out in high  relief on Kerry Blane's forehead, but he made no sound. At last,  Splinter finished, tucked the supplies away.\n\n\n \"Now what?\" he asked subduedly.\n\n\n \"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. Can't tell but  what that protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit  in the near future!\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter unscrewed the port cogs, swung the portal back.\n\n\n He swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the  older man. After much puffing and grunting, Kerry Blane managed to  clamber through the port. They stood for a moment in silent wonder,  staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled  endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like  trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\n\n\n \"How big do you feel now?\" Kerry Blane asked quietly.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was silent, awed by the beauty and the tremendous size of  the growths on the water world.\n\n\n Kerry Blane walked the length of the cruiser, examining the slight  damage done by the crash, evaluating the situation with a practiced  gaze. He nodded slowly, retraced his steps, and stood looking at the  furrow plowed in the sand.\n\n\n \"Won't be any trouble at all to lift the ship,\" he called. \"After  rewiring the board, we'll turn the ship with an underjet, swing it  about, and head her toward the sea.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, dropped into the open port. A moment later, he flipped  a rope ladder outside, where it dangled to the ground, then climbed out  himself, carrying the two Zelta guns.\n\n\n \"We'd better test these,\" he said. \"We don't want any slip-ups when we  do go into action.\"\n\n\n He climbed down the ladder, laid the guns aside, then reached up a  hand to aid Kerry Blane's descent. Kerry Blane came down slowly and  awkwardly, jumped the last few feet. He felt surprisingly light and  strong in the lesser gravity.\n\n\n He stood, leaning against the ship, watching as Splinter picked up  the first gun and leveled it at a gigantic tree. Splinter sighted  carefully, winked at the older man, then pressed the firing stud.\n\n\n Nothing happened; there was no hissing crackle of released energy.\n\n\n Kerry Blane strode forward, puzzlement on his lined face, his hand  out-stretched toward the defective weapon. Splinter gaped at the gun in  his hands, held it out wordlessly.\n\n\n \"The crash must have broken something,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head. \"There's only one moving part,\" he said, \"and  that's the force gate on the firing stud.\"\n\n\n \"Try the other,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n \"Okay!\"\n\n\n Splinter lifted the second gun, pressed the stud, gazed white-faced at  his companion.\n\n\n \"It won't work, either,\" he said stupidly. \"I don't get it? The source  of power is limitless. Solar rays never\u2014\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane dropped the first gun to his side, swore harshly.\n\n\n \"Damn it,\" he said. \"They didn't think of it; you didn't think of it;  and I most certainly forgot! Solar rays can't penetrate the miles of  clouds on Venus. Those guns are utterly useless as weapons!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are the islands of Venus?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Exposed continental plates risen to the surface from tectonics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Floating pads covered in jungle\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Floating pads covered in jungle\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Floating pads covered in jungle\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

PEACOCK The orders were explicit: \"Destroy the\n\n 'THING' of Venus.\" But Patrolmen Kerry\n\n Blane and Splinter Wood, their space-ship\n\n wrecked, could not follow orders\u2014their\n\n weapons were useless on the Water-world.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Old Kerry Blane exploded.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" he roared. \"I don't like you; and I don't like this ship;  and I don't like the assignment; and I don't like those infernal pills  you keep eating; and I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Splinter\" Wood grinned.\n\n\n \"Seems to me, Kerry,\" he remarked humorously, \"that you don't like much  of anything!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane growled unintelligibly, batted the injector lever with a  calloused hand. His grizzled hair was a stiff wiry mop on his small  head, and his oversize jaw was thrust belligerently forward. But deep  within his eyes, where he hoped it was hidden, was a friendly twinkle  that gave the lie to his speech.\n\n\n \"You're a squirt!\" he snapped disagreeably. \"You're not dry behind  the ears, yet. You're like the rest of these kids who call themselves  pilots\u2014only more so! And why the hell the chief had to sic you on me,  on an exploration trip this important\u2014well, I'll never understand.\"\n\n\n Splinter rolled his six foot three of lanky body into a more  comfortable position on the air-bunk. He yawned tremendously, fumbled a  small box from his shirt pocket, and removed a marble-like capsule.\n\n\n \"Better take one of these,\" he warned. \"You're liable to get the space  bends at any moment.\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane snorted, batted the box aside impatiently, scowled  moodily at the capsules that bounced for a moment against the pilot  room's walls before hanging motionless in the air.\n\n\n \"Mister Wood,\" he said icily, \"I was flying a space ship while they  were changing your pants twenty times a day. When I want advice on how  to fly a ship, how to cure space bends, how to handle a Zelta ray, or  how to spit\u2014I'll ask you! Until then, you and your bloody marbles can  go plumb straight to the devil!\"\n\n\n \"Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!\" Splinter reached out lazily, plucked the capsules from  the air, one by one.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit one of the five allotted cigarettes of the day.\n\n\n \"Don't 'tsk' me, you young squirt,\" he grunted around a mouthful of  fragrant smoke. \"I know all the arguments you can put up; ain't that  all I been hearing for a week? You take your vitamins A, B, C, D, all  you want, but you leave me alone\u2014or I'll stuff your head down your  throat, P.D.Q.!\"\n\n\n \"All right, all right!\" Splinter tucked the capsule box back into his  pocket, grinned mockingly. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. With this  shielded ship, and with no sunlight reaching Venus' surface, you're  gonna be begging for some of my vitamin, super-concentrated pills  before we get back to Earth.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane made a rich, ripe noise with his mouth.\n\n\n \"Pfuii!\" he said very distinctly.\n\n\n \"Gracious!\" Splinter said in mock horror. They made a strange contrast as they lay in their air bunks. Splinter  was fully a head taller than the dour Irishman, and his lanky build  gave a false impression of awkwardness. While the vitriolic Kerry Blane  was short and compact, strength and quickness evident in every movement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane had flown every type of ship that rode in space. In the  passing years, he had flight-tested almost every new experimental ship,  had flown them with increasing skill, had earned a reputation as a  trouble shooter on any kind of craft.\n\n\n But even Kerry Blane had to retire eventually.\n\n\n A great retirement banquet had been given in his honor by the  Interplanetary Squadron. There had been the usual speeches and  presentations; and Kerry Blane had heard them all, had thanked the  donors of the gifts. But it was not until the next morning, when he was  dressed in civilian clothes for the first time in forty years, that he  realized the enormity of the thing that had happened to his life.\n\n\n Something died within Kerry Blane's heart that morning, shriveled and  passed away, leaving him suddenly shrunken and old. He had become like  a rusty old freighter couched between the gleaming bodies of great  space warriors.\n\n\n Finally, as a last resort so that he would not be thrown entirely  aside, he had taken a desk job in the squadron offices. For six years  he had dry-rotted there, waiting hopefully for the moment when his  active services would be needed again.\n\n\n It was there that he had met and liked the ungainly Splinter Wood.  There was something in the boy that had found a kindred spirit in Kerry  Blane's heart, and he had taken the youngster in hand to give him the  benefits of experience that had become legendary.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was a probationary pilot, had been admitted to the  Interplanetary Squadron because of his inherent skill, even though his  formal education had been fairly well neglected. Now, the two of them rode the pounding jets of a DX cruiser, bound  for Venus to make a personal survey of its floating islands for the  Interplanetary Squadron's Medical Division.\n\n\n \"Ten to one we don't get back!\" Splinter said pessimistically.\n\n\n Kerry Blane scrubbed out his cigarette, scowled bleakly at the  instrument panel. He sensed the faint thread of fear in the youngster's  tone, and a nostalgic twinge touched his heart, for he was remembering  the days of his youth when he had a full life to look forward to.\n\n\n \"If you're afraid, you can get out and walk back,\" he snapped  disagreeably.\n\n\n A grin lifted the corners of Splinter's long mouth, spread into his  eyes. His hand unconsciously came up, touched the tiny squadron pin on  his lapel.\n\n\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, glory grabber,\" he said mockingly, \"but I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"\n\n\n \" Me! You've got orders to take care of me ?\" Kerry Blane choked  incoherently for a moment, red tiding cholerically upward from his  loosened collar.\n\n\n \"Of course!\" Splinter grinned.\n\n\n Kerry Blane exploded, words spewing volcanically forth. Splinter  relaxed, his booted foot beating out a dull rhythm to the colorful  language learned through almost fifty years of spacing. And at last,  when Kerry Blane had quieted until he but smoldered, he leaned over and  touched the old spacer on the sleeve.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight!\" he remarked pleasantly.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight what?\" Kerry Blane asked sullenly, the old twinkle  beginning to light again deep in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight new words\u2014and you swore them beautifully!\" Splinter  beamed. \"Some day you can teach them to me.\"\n\n\n They laughed then, Old Kerry Blane and young Splinter Wood, and  the warmth of their friendship was a tangible thing in the small  control-room of the cruiser.\n\n\n And in the midst of their laughter, Old Kerry Blane choked in agony,  surged desperately against his bunk straps.\n\n\n He screamed unknowingly, feeling only the horrible excruciating agony  of his body, tasting the blood that gushed from his mouth and nostrils.  His muscles were knotted cords that he could not loosen, and his blood  was a surging stream that pounded at his throbbing temples. The air he  breathed seemed to be molten flame.\n\n\n His body arced again and again against the restraining straps, and his  mouth was open in a soundless scream. He sensed dimly that his partner  had wrenched open a wall door, removed metal medicine kits, and was  fumbling through their contents. He felt the bite of the hypodermic,  felt a deadly numbness replace the raging torment that had been his  for seconds. He swallowed three capsules automatically, passed into a  coma-like sleep, woke hours later to stare clear-eyed into Splinter's  concerned face.\n\n\n \"Close, wasn't it?\" he said weakly, conversationally.\n\n\n \"Close enough!\" Splinter agreed relievedly. \"If you had followed my  advice and taken those vitamin capsules, you'd never have had the  bends.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, winced when he felt the dull ache in his body.\n\n\n \"I've had the bends before, and lived through them!\" he said, still  weakly defiant.\n\n\n \"That's the past,\" Splinter said quietly. \"This is the present, and you  take your pills every day, just as I do\u2014from now on.\"\n\n\n \"All right\u2014and thanks!\"\n\n\n \"Forget it!\" Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\n\n\n A buzzer sounded from the instrument panel, and a tiny light glowed  redly.\n\n\n \"Six hours more,\" Splinter said, turned to the instrument panel.\n\n\n His long hands played over the instrument panel, checking, controlling  the rocket fire, adjusting delicate instruments to hairline marks.  Kerry Blane nodded in silent approval.\n\n\n They could feel the first tug of gravity on their bodies, and through  the vision port could see the greenish ball that was cloud-covered  Venus. Excitement lifted their spirits, brought light to their eyes as  they peered eagerly ahead.\n\n\n \"What's it really like?\" Splinter asked impatiently.\n\n\n Kerry Blane yawned, settled back luxuriously. \"I'll tell you later,\" he  said, \"I'm going to take a nap and try to ease this bellyache of mine.  Wake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky  place to set a ship on.\"\n\n\n He yawned again, drifted instantly into sleep, relaxing with the  ability of a spaceman who sleeps when and if he can. Splinter smiled  down at his sleeping partner, then turned back to the quartzite port.  He shook his head a bit, remembering the stories he had heard about the  water planet, wondering\u2014wondering\u2014 II\n\n\n Venus was a fluffy cotton ball hanging motionless in bottomless  space. Far to the left, Mercury gleamed like a polished diamond in  the sunlight. Kerry Blane cut the driving rockets, let the cruiser  sink into a fast gravity-dive, guiding it only now and then by a brief  flicker of a side jet.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched breathlessly from the vision port, his long face  eager and reckless, his eyes seeking to pierce the clouds that roiled  and twisted uneasily over the surface of the planet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane glanced tolerantly at his young companion, felt a nostalgic  tug at his heart when he remembered the first time he had approached  the water-planet years before. Then, he had been a young and reckless  firebrand, his fame already spreading, an unquenchable fire of  adventure flaming in his heart.\n\n\n Now, his aged but steady fingers rested lightly on the controls,  brought the patrol cruiser closer to the cloud-banks on the line of  demarcation between the sunward and sunless sides of the planet. He  hummed tunelessly, strangely happy, as he peered ahead.\n\n\n \"Val Kenton died there,\" Splinter whispered softly, \"Died to save the  lives of three other people!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, and his voice changed subtly.  \"Val was a blackguard, a criminal; but he died in the best traditions  of the service.\" He sighed. \"He never had a chance.\"\n\n\n \"Murdered!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane smiled grimly. \"I guess I used too broad an interpretation  of the word,\" he said gently. \"Anyway, one of our main tasks is to  destroy the thing that killed him.\"\n\n\n His lean fingers tightened unconsciously.\n\n\n \"I'd like nothing better than to turn a Zelta-blaster on that chunk of  living protoplasm and cremate it.\"\n\n\n Splinters shivered slightly. \"Do you think we'll find it?\" he asked.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"I think it will find us; after all, it's just an  animated appetite looking for food.\"\n\n\n He turned back to the controls, flipped a switch, and the cutting of  the nose rocket dropped the ship in an angling glide toward the clouds  a few miles below. Gravity was full strength now, and although not as  great as Earth's, was still strong enough to bring a sense of giddiness  to the men.\n\n\n \"Here we go!\" Splinter said tonelessly.\n\n\n The great cottony batts of roiling clouds rushed up to meet the ship,  bringing the first sense of violent movement in more than a week of  flying. There was something awesome and breath-taking in the speed with  which the ship dropped toward the planet.\n\n\n Tendrils of vapor touched the ports, were whipped aside, then were  replaced by heavier fingers of cloud. Kerry Blane pressed a firing  stud, and nose rockets thrummed in a rising crescendo as the free fall  of the cruiser was checked. Heat rose in the cabin from the friction of  the outer air, then dissipated, as the force-screen voltometer leaped  higher.\n\n\n Then, as though it had never been, the sun disappeared, and there was  only a gray blankness pressing about the ship. Gone was all sense of  movement, and the ship seemed to hover in a gray nothingness.\n\n\n Kerry Blane crouched over the control panel, his hands moving deftly,  his eyes flicking from one instrument to another. Tiny lines of  concentration etched themselves about his mouth, and perspiration  beaded his forehead. He rode that cruiser through the miles of clouds  through sheer instinctive ability, seeming to fly it as though he were  an integral part of the ship.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched him with awe in his eyes, seeing for the first  time the incredible instinct that had made Kerry Blane the idol of a  billion people. He relaxed visibly, all instinctive fear allayed by the  brilliant competence of his companion.\n\n\n Seconds flowed into moments, and the moments merged into one another,  and still the clouds pressed with a visible strength against the  ports. The rockets drummed steadily, holding the ship aloft, dropping  it slowly toward the planet below. Then the clouds thinned, and,  incredibly, were permeated with a dim and glowing light. A second  later, and the clouds were gone, and a thousand feet below tumbled and  tossed in a majestic display of ruthless strength an ocean that seemed  to be composed of liquid fluorescence.\n\n\n Kerry Blane heard Splinter's instant sigh of unbelief.\n\n\n \"Good Lord!\" Splinter said, \"What\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice stilled, and he was silent, his eyes drinking in the weird  incredible scene below. The ocean was a shifting, white-capped wash of silvery light that  gleamed with a bright phosphorescence of a hundred, intermingled,  kaleidoscopic colors. And the unreal, unearthly light continued  unbroken everywhere, reflected from the low-hanging clouds, reaching  to the far horizon, bathing every detail of the planet in a brilliance  more bright than moonlight.\n\n\n Splinter turned a wondering face. \"But the official reports say that  there is no light on Venus,\" he exclaimed. \"That was one of the reasons  given when exploration was forbidden!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"That was merely a pretext to keep foolhardy  spacemen from losing their lives on the planet. In reality, the  ocean is alive with an incredibly tiny marine worm that glows  phosphorescently. The light generated from those billions of worms is  reflected back from the clouds, makes Venus eternally lighted.\"\n\n\n He turned the ship to the North, relaxed a bit on the air bunk. He  felt tired and worn, his body aching from the space bends of a few  hours before.\n\n\n \"Take over,\" he said wearily. \"Take the ship North, and watch for any  island.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, rested his long hands on the controls. The space  cruiser lifted a bit in a sudden spurt of speed, and the rocket-sound  was a solid thrum of unleashed power.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit a cigarette, leaned toward a vision port. He felt again  that thrill he had experienced when he had first flashed his single-man  cruiser through the clouds years before. Then the breath caught in his  throat, and he tapped his companion's arm.\n\n\n \"Take a look!\" he called excitedly.\n\n\n They fought in the ocean below, fought in a never-ending splashing of  what seemed to be liquid fire. It was like watching a tri-dim screen of  a news event, except for the utter lack of sound.\n\n\n One was scaly, while the other was skinned, and both were fully three  hundred feet long. Great scimitars of teeth flashed in the light, and  blood gouted and stained the water crimson whenever a slashing blow was  struck. They threshed in a mad paroxysm of rage, whirling and spinning  in the phosphorescent water like beings from a nightmare, exploding  out of their element time and again, only to fall back in a gargantuan  spray of fluorescence.\n\n\n And then the scaly monster flashed in a half-turn, drove forward with  jaws agape, wrenched and ripped at the smooth black throat of the other  creature. The second creature rippled and undulated in agony, whipping  the ocean to foam, then went limp. The victorious monster circled the  body of its dead foe, then, majestically, plunged from sight into the  ocean's depths. An instant later, the water frothed, as hundreds of  lesser marine monsters attacked and fed on the floating corpse.\n\n\n \"Brrrr!\" Splinter shivered in sudden horror.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled dryly. \"Feel like going for a swim?\" he asked  conversationally.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head, watched the scene disappear from view to the  rear of the line of flight, then sank back onto his bunk.\n\n\n \"Not me!\" he said deprecatingly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled again, swung the cruiser toward the tiny smudge of  black on the horizon. Glowing water flashed beneath the ship, seeming  to smooth into a gleaming mirror shot with dancing colors. There was no  sign of life anywhere.\n\n\n Thirty minutes later, Kerry Blane circled the island that floated  free in the phosphorescent ocean. His keen eyes searched the tangled  luxuriant growth of the jungle below, searching for some indication  that the protoplasmic monster he seeked was there.\n\n\n \"I don't see anything suspicious,\" Splinter contributed.\n\n\n \"There's nothing special to see,\" Kerry Blane said shortly. \"As I  understand it, anyway, this chunk of animated appetite hangs around an  island shaped like a turtle. However, our orders are to investigate  every island, just in case there might be more than one of the  monsters.\"\n\n\n Splinter buckled on his dis-gun, excitement flaring in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Let's do a little exploring?\" he said eagerly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane shook his head, swung the cruiser north again.\n\n\n \"Plenty of time for that later,\" he said mildly. \"We'll find this  turtle-island, make a landing, and take a look around. Later, if we're  lucky enough to blow our objective to Kingdom Come, we'll do a little  exploring of the other islands.\"\n\n\n \"Hell!\" Splinter scowled in mock disgust. \"An old woman like you should  be taking in knitting for a living!\"\n\n\n \"Orders are orders!\" Kerry Blane shrugged. He swung the cruiser in a wide arc to the north, trebling the flying  speed within minutes, handling the controls with a familiar dexterity.  He said nothing, searched the gleaming ocean for the smudge of  blackness that would denote another island. His gaze flicked amusedly,  now and then, to the lanky Splinter who scowled moodily and toyed with  the dis-gun in his long hands.\n\n\n \"Cheer up, lad,\" Kerry Blane said finally. \"I think you'll find plenty  to occupy your time shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe?\" Splinter said gloomily.\n\n\n He idly swallowed another vitamin capsule, grinned, when he saw Kerry  Blane's automatic grimace of distaste. Then he yawned hugely, twisted  into a comfortable position, dozed sleepily.\n\n\n Kerry Blane rode the controls for the next three hours, searching the  limitless ocean for the few specks of islands that followed the slow  currents of the water planet. Always, there was the same misty light  surrounding the ship, never dimming, giving a sense of unreality to the  scene below. Nowhere was there the slightest sign of life until, in the  fourth hour of flight, a tiny dot of blackness came slowly over the  horizon's water line.\n\n\n Kerry Blane spun the ship in a tight circle, sent it flashing to the  west. His keen eyes lighted, when he finally made out the turtle-like  outline of the island, and he whistled softly, off-key, as he nudged  the snoring Splinter.\n\n\n \"This is it, Sleeping Beauty,\" he called. \"Snap out of it!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Whuzzat?\" Splinter grunted, rolled to his elbow.\n\n\n \"Here's the island.\"\n\n\n \"Oh!\" Splinter swung his feet from the bunk, peered from the vision  port, sleepiness instantly erased from his face.\n\n\n \"Hot damn!\" he chortled. \"Now we'll see a little action!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, tried to conceal the excitement he felt. He shook  his head, his fingers flickering over the control studs.\n\n\n \"Don't get your hopes too high, lad,\" he counseled. \"With those super  Zelta guns, it won't take ten minutes to wipe out that monster.\"\n\n\n Splinter rubbed his hands together, sighed like a boy seeing his first  circus. \"Listen, for ten minutes of that, I'd ride this chunk of metal  for a year!\"\n\n\n \"Could be!\" Kerry Blane agreed.\n\n\n He peered through the port, seeking any spot clear enough for a landing  field. Except for a strip of open beach, the island was a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n\n\n \"Belt yourself,\" Kerry Blane warned. \"If that beach isn't solid, I'll  have to lift the ship in a hell of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter's fingers were all thumbs in his excitement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane set the controls for a shallow glide, his fingers moving  like a concert pianist's. The cruiser yawed slightly, settled slowly  in a flat shallow glide.\n\n\n \"We're going in,\" Kerry Blane said quietly.\n\n\n He closed a knife switch, seeing too late the vitamin capsule that was  lodged in the slot. There was the sharp splutter of a short-circuit,  and a thin tendril of smoke drifted upward.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" Kerry Blane swore briefly.\n\n\n There was an instant, terrific explosion of the stern jets, and the  cruiser hurtled toward the beach like a gravity-crazed comet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane said absolutely nothing, his breath driven from him by the  suck of inertia. His hands darted for the controls, seeking to balance  the forces that threw the ship about like a toy. He cut all rockets  with a smashing swoop of his hand, tried to fire the bow rockets. But  the short had ruined the entire control system.\n\n\n For one interminable second, he saw the uncanny uprush of the island  below. He flicked his gaze about, saw the instant terror that wiped  all other expression from his young companion's face. Then the cruiser  plowed into the silvery sand.\n\n\n Belts parted like rotten string; they were thrown forward with crushing  force against the control panel. They groped feebly for support, their  bodies twisting involuntarily, as the ship cartwheeled a dozen times in  a few seconds. Almost instantly, consciousness was battered from them.\n\n\n With one final, grinding bounce, the cruiser rolled to its side,  twisted over and over for a hundred yards, then came to a metal-ripping  stop against a moss-grown boulder at the water's edge. III\n\n\n Kerry Blane choked, tried to turn his head from the water that trickled  into his face. He opened his eyes, stared blankly, uncomprehendingly  into the bloody features of the man bending over him.\n\n\n \"What happened?\" he gasped.\n\n\n Splinter Wood laughed, almost hysterically, mopped at his forehead with  a wet handkerchief.\n\n\n \"I thought you were dead!\" he said simply.\n\n\n Kerry Blane moved his arm experimentally, felt broken bones grate in  an exquisite wave of pain. He fought back the nausea, gazed about the  cabin, realized the ship lay on its side.\n\n\n \"Maybe I am,\" he said ruefully. \"No man could live through that crash.\"\n\n\n Splinter moved away, sat down tiredly on the edge of a bunk. He shook  his head dazedly, inspected the long cut on his leg.\n\n\n \"We seem to have done it,\" he said dully.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded, clambered to his feet, favoring his broken arm.  He leaned over the control panel, inspecting the dials with a worried  gaze. Slowly, his eyes lightened, and his voice was almost cheerful as  he swung about.\n\n\n \"Everything is more or less okay,\" he said. \"The board will have to  be rewired, but nothing else seems to be damaged so that repairs are  needed.\"\n\n\n Splinter looked up from his task of bandaging his leg. \"What caused  the crash?\" he asked. \"One minute, everything was all right; the next,  Blooey!\"\n\n\n Anger suddenly mottled Kerry Blane's face; he swore monotonously and  bitterly for a moment.\n\n\n \"Those gol-damned pills you been taking caused the crash!\" he roared.  \"One of them broke and shorted out the control board.\" He scowled at  the incredulous Splinter. \"By the three tails of a Martian sand-pup, I  ought to cram the rest of them down your throat, boxes and all!\"\n\n\n Splinter flushed, seemed to be fumbling for words. After a bit, Kerry  Blane grinned.\n\n\n \"Forget it, lad,\" he said more kindly, \"those things happen. Now, if  you'll bind a splint about my arm, we'll see what we can do about  righting the ship.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, opened the medical locker, worked with tape and  splints for minutes. Great beads of perspiration stood out in high  relief on Kerry Blane's forehead, but he made no sound. At last,  Splinter finished, tucked the supplies away.\n\n\n \"Now what?\" he asked subduedly.\n\n\n \"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. Can't tell but  what that protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit  in the near future!\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter unscrewed the port cogs, swung the portal back.\n\n\n He swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the  older man. After much puffing and grunting, Kerry Blane managed to  clamber through the port. They stood for a moment in silent wonder,  staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled  endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like  trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\n\n\n \"How big do you feel now?\" Kerry Blane asked quietly.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was silent, awed by the beauty and the tremendous size of  the growths on the water world.\n\n\n Kerry Blane walked the length of the cruiser, examining the slight  damage done by the crash, evaluating the situation with a practiced  gaze. He nodded slowly, retraced his steps, and stood looking at the  furrow plowed in the sand.\n\n\n \"Won't be any trouble at all to lift the ship,\" he called. \"After  rewiring the board, we'll turn the ship with an underjet, swing it  about, and head her toward the sea.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, dropped into the open port. A moment later, he flipped  a rope ladder outside, where it dangled to the ground, then climbed out  himself, carrying the two Zelta guns.\n\n\n \"We'd better test these,\" he said. \"We don't want any slip-ups when we  do go into action.\"\n\n\n He climbed down the ladder, laid the guns aside, then reached up a  hand to aid Kerry Blane's descent. Kerry Blane came down slowly and  awkwardly, jumped the last few feet. He felt surprisingly light and  strong in the lesser gravity.\n\n\n He stood, leaning against the ship, watching as Splinter picked up  the first gun and leveled it at a gigantic tree. Splinter sighted  carefully, winked at the older man, then pressed the firing stud.\n\n\n Nothing happened; there was no hissing crackle of released energy.\n\n\n Kerry Blane strode forward, puzzlement on his lined face, his hand  out-stretched toward the defective weapon. Splinter gaped at the gun in  his hands, held it out wordlessly.\n\n\n \"The crash must have broken something,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head. \"There's only one moving part,\" he said, \"and  that's the force gate on the firing stud.\"\n\n\n \"Try the other,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n \"Okay!\"\n\n\n Splinter lifted the second gun, pressed the stud, gazed white-faced at  his companion.\n\n\n \"It won't work, either,\" he said stupidly. \"I don't get it? The source  of power is limitless. Solar rays never\u2014\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane dropped the first gun to his side, swore harshly.\n\n\n \"Damn it,\" he said. \"They didn't think of it; you didn't think of it;  and I most certainly forgot! Solar rays can't penetrate the miles of  clouds on Venus. Those guns are utterly useless as weapons!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are the islands of Venus?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Floating pads covered in jungle\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Exposed continental plates risen to the surface from tectonics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Exposed continental plates risen to the surface from tectonics\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Exposed continental plates risen to the surface from tectonics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

His grizzled hair was a stiff wiry mop on his small  head, and his oversize jaw was thrust belligerently forward. But deep  within his eyes, where he hoped it was hidden, was a friendly twinkle  that gave the lie to his speech.\n\n\n \"You're a squirt!\" he snapped disagreeably. \"You're not dry behind  the ears, yet.

And why the hell the chief had to sic you on me,  on an exploration trip this important\u2014well, I'll never understand.\"\n\n\n Splinter rolled his six foot three of lanky body into a more  comfortable position on the air-bunk. He yawned tremendously, fumbled a  small box from his shirt pocket, and removed a marble-like capsule.\n\n\n \"Better take one of these,\" he warned. \"You're liable to get the space  bends at any moment.\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane snorted, batted the box aside impatiently, scowled  moodily at the capsules that bounced for a moment against the pilot  room's walls before hanging motionless in the air.\n\n\n \"Mister Wood,\" he said icily, \"I was flying a space ship while they  were changing your pants twenty times a day. When I want advice on how  to fly a ship, how to cure space bends, how to handle a Zelta ray, or  how to spit\u2014I'll ask you! Until then, you and your bloody marbles can  go plumb straight to the devil!\"\n\n\n \"Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!\" Splinter reached out lazily, plucked the capsules from  the air, one by one.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit one of the five allotted cigarettes of the day.\n\n\n \"Don't 'tsk' me, you young squirt,\" he grunted around a mouthful of  fragrant smoke. \"I know all the arguments you can put up; ain't that  all I been hearing for a week? You take your vitamins A, B, C, D, all  you want, but you leave me alone\u2014or I'll stuff your head down your  throat, P.D.Q.!\"\n\n\n \"All right, all right!\" Splinter tucked the capsule box back into his  pocket, grinned mockingly. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. With this  shielded ship, and with no sunlight reaching Venus' surface, you're  gonna be begging for some of my vitamin, super-concentrated pills  before we get back to Earth.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane made a rich, ripe noise with his mouth.\n\n\n \"Pfuii!\" he said very distinctly.\n\n\n \"Gracious!\" Splinter said in mock horror. They made a strange contrast as they lay in their air bunks. Splinter  was fully a head taller than the dour Irishman, and his lanky build  gave a false impression of awkwardness. While the vitriolic Kerry Blane  was short and compact, strength and quickness evident in every movement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane had flown every type of ship that rode in space. In the  passing years, he had flight-tested almost every new experimental ship,  had flown them with increasing skill, had earned a reputation as a  trouble shooter on any kind of craft.\n\n\n But even Kerry Blane had to retire eventually.\n\n\n A great retirement banquet had been given in his honor by the  Interplanetary Squadron. There had been the usual speeches and  presentations; and Kerry Blane had heard them all, had thanked the  donors of the gifts. But it was not until the next morning, when he was  dressed in civilian clothes for the first time in forty years, that he  realized the enormity of the thing that had happened to his life.\n\n\n Something died within Kerry Blane's heart that morning, shriveled and  passed away, leaving him suddenly shrunken and old. He had become like  a rusty old freighter couched between the gleaming bodies of great  space warriors.\n\n\n Finally, as a last resort so that he would not be thrown entirely  aside, he had taken a desk job in the squadron offices. For six years  he had dry-rotted there, waiting hopefully for the moment when his  active services would be needed again.\n\n\n It was there that he had met and liked the ungainly Splinter Wood.  There was something in the boy that had found a kindred spirit in Kerry  Blane's heart, and he had taken the youngster in hand to give him the  benefits of experience that had become legendary.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was a probationary pilot, had been admitted to the  Interplanetary Squadron because of his inherent skill, even though his  formal education had been fairly well neglected. Now, the two of them rode the pounding jets of a DX cruiser, bound  for Venus to make a personal survey of its floating islands for the  Interplanetary Squadron's Medical Division.\n\n\n \"Ten to one we don't get back!\" Splinter said pessimistically.\n\n\n Kerry Blane scrubbed out his cigarette, scowled bleakly at the  instrument panel. He sensed the faint thread of fear in the youngster's  tone, and a nostalgic twinge touched his heart, for he was remembering  the days of his youth when he had a full life to look forward to.\n\n\n \"If you're afraid, you can get out and walk back,\" he snapped  disagreeably.\n\n\n A grin lifted the corners of Splinter's long mouth, spread into his  eyes. His hand unconsciously came up, touched the tiny squadron pin on  his lapel.\n\n\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, glory grabber,\" he said mockingly, \"but I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"\n\n\n \" Me! You've got orders to take care of me ?\" Kerry Blane choked  incoherently for a moment, red tiding cholerically upward from his  loosened collar.\n\n\n \"Of course!\" Splinter grinned.\n\n\n Kerry Blane exploded, words spewing volcanically forth. Splinter  relaxed, his booted foot beating out a dull rhythm to the colorful  language learned through almost fifty years of spacing. And at last,  when Kerry Blane had quieted until he but smoldered, he leaned over and  touched the old spacer on the sleeve.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight!\" he remarked pleasantly.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight what?\" Kerry Blane asked sullenly, the old twinkle  beginning to light again deep in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight new words\u2014and you swore them beautifully!\" Splinter  beamed. \"Some day you can teach them to me.\"\n\n\n They laughed then, Old Kerry Blane and young Splinter Wood, and  the warmth of their friendship was a tangible thing in the small  control-room of the cruiser.\n\n\n And in the midst of their laughter, Old Kerry Blane choked in agony,  surged desperately against his bunk straps.\n\n\n He screamed unknowingly, feeling only the horrible excruciating agony  of his body, tasting the blood that gushed from his mouth and nostrils.  His muscles were knotted cords that he could not loosen, and his blood  was a surging stream that pounded at his throbbing temples. The air he  breathed seemed to be molten flame.\n\n\n His body arced again and again against the restraining straps, and his  mouth was open in a soundless scream. He sensed dimly that his partner  had wrenched open a wall door, removed metal medicine kits, and was  fumbling through their contents. He felt the bite of the hypodermic,  felt a deadly numbness replace the raging torment that had been his  for seconds. He swallowed three capsules automatically, passed into a  coma-like sleep, woke hours later to stare clear-eyed into Splinter's  concerned face.\n\n\n \"Close, wasn't it?\" he said weakly, conversationally.\n\n\n \"Close enough!\" Splinter agreed relievedly. \"If you had followed my  advice and taken those vitamin capsules, you'd never have had the  bends.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, winced when he felt the dull ache in his body.\n\n\n \"I've had the bends before, and lived through them!\" he said, still  weakly defiant.\n\n\n \"That's the past,\" Splinter said quietly. \"This is the present, and you  take your pills every day, just as I do\u2014from now on.\"\n\n\n \"All right\u2014and thanks!\"\n\n\n \"Forget it!\" Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\n\n\n A buzzer sounded from the instrument panel, and a tiny light glowed  redly.\n\n\n \"Six hours more,\" Splinter said, turned to the instrument panel.\n\n\n His long hands played over the instrument panel, checking, controlling  the rocket fire, adjusting delicate instruments to hairline marks.  Kerry Blane nodded in silent approval.\n\n\n They could feel the first tug of gravity on their bodies, and through  the vision port could see the greenish ball that was cloud-covered  Venus. Excitement lifted their spirits, brought light to their eyes as  they peered eagerly ahead.\n\n\n \"What's it really like?\" Splinter asked impatiently.\n\n\n Kerry Blane yawned, settled back luxuriously. \"I'll tell you later,\" he  said, \"I'm going to take a nap and try to ease this bellyache of mine.  Wake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky  place to set a ship on.\"\n\n\n He yawned again, drifted instantly into sleep, relaxing with the  ability of a spaceman who sleeps when and if he can. Splinter smiled  down at his sleeping partner, then turned back to the quartzite port.  He shook his head a bit, remembering the stories he had heard about the  water planet, wondering\u2014wondering\u2014 II\n\n\n Venus was a fluffy cotton ball hanging motionless in bottomless  space. Far to the left, Mercury gleamed like a polished diamond in  the sunlight. Kerry Blane cut the driving rockets, let the cruiser  sink into a fast gravity-dive, guiding it only now and then by a brief  flicker of a side jet.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched breathlessly from the vision port, his long face  eager and reckless, his eyes seeking to pierce the clouds that roiled  and twisted uneasily over the surface of the planet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane glanced tolerantly at his young companion, felt a nostalgic  tug at his heart when he remembered the first time he had approached  the water-planet years before. Then, he had been a young and reckless  firebrand, his fame already spreading, an unquenchable fire of  adventure flaming in his heart.\n\n\n Now, his aged but steady fingers rested lightly on the controls,  brought the patrol cruiser closer to the cloud-banks on the line of  demarcation between the sunward and sunless sides of the planet. He  hummed tunelessly, strangely happy, as he peered ahead.\n\n\n \"Val Kenton died there,\" Splinter whispered softly, \"Died to save the  lives of three other people!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, and his voice changed subtly.  \"Val was a blackguard, a criminal; but he died in the best traditions  of the service.\" He sighed. \"He never had a chance.\"\n\n\n \"Murdered!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane smiled grimly. \"I guess I used too broad an interpretation  of the word,\" he said gently. \"Anyway, one of our main tasks is to  destroy the thing that killed him.\"\n\n\n His lean fingers tightened unconsciously.\n\n\n \"I'd like nothing better than to turn a Zelta-blaster on that chunk of  living protoplasm and cremate it.\"\n\n\n Splinters shivered slightly. \"Do you think we'll find it?\" he asked.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"I think it will find us; after all, it's just an  animated appetite looking for food.\"\n\n\n He turned back to the controls, flipped a switch, and the cutting of  the nose rocket dropped the ship in an angling glide toward the clouds  a few miles below. Gravity was full strength now, and although not as  great as Earth's, was still strong enough to bring a sense of giddiness  to the men.\n\n\n \"Here we go!\" Splinter said tonelessly.\n\n\n The great cottony batts of roiling clouds rushed up to meet the ship,  bringing the first sense of violent movement in more than a week of  flying. There was something awesome and breath-taking in the speed with  which the ship dropped toward the planet.\n\n\n Tendrils of vapor touched the ports, were whipped aside, then were  replaced by heavier fingers of cloud. Kerry Blane pressed a firing  stud, and nose rockets thrummed in a rising crescendo as the free fall  of the cruiser was checked. Heat rose in the cabin from the friction of  the outer air, then dissipated, as the force-screen voltometer leaped  higher.\n\n\n Then, as though it had never been, the sun disappeared, and there was  only a gray blankness pressing about the ship. Gone was all sense of  movement, and the ship seemed to hover in a gray nothingness.\n\n\n Kerry Blane crouched over the control panel, his hands moving deftly,  his eyes flicking from one instrument to another. Tiny lines of  concentration etched themselves about his mouth, and perspiration  beaded his forehead. He rode that cruiser through the miles of clouds  through sheer instinctive ability, seeming to fly it as though he were  an integral part of the ship.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched him with awe in his eyes, seeing for the first  time the incredible instinct that had made Kerry Blane the idol of a  billion people. He relaxed visibly, all instinctive fear allayed by the  brilliant competence of his companion.\n\n\n Seconds flowed into moments, and the moments merged into one another,  and still the clouds pressed with a visible strength against the  ports. The rockets drummed steadily, holding the ship aloft, dropping  it slowly toward the planet below. Then the clouds thinned, and,  incredibly, were permeated with a dim and glowing light. A second  later, and the clouds were gone, and a thousand feet below tumbled and  tossed in a majestic display of ruthless strength an ocean that seemed  to be composed of liquid fluorescence.\n\n\n Kerry Blane heard Splinter's instant sigh of unbelief.\n\n\n \"Good Lord!\" Splinter said, \"What\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice stilled, and he was silent, his eyes drinking in the weird  incredible scene below. The ocean was a shifting, white-capped wash of silvery light that  gleamed with a bright phosphorescence of a hundred, intermingled,  kaleidoscopic colors. And the unreal, unearthly light continued  unbroken everywhere, reflected from the low-hanging clouds, reaching  to the far horizon, bathing every detail of the planet in a brilliance  more bright than moonlight.\n\n\n Splinter turned a wondering face. \"But the official reports say that  there is no light on Venus,\" he exclaimed. \"That was one of the reasons  given when exploration was forbidden!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"That was merely a pretext to keep foolhardy  spacemen from losing their lives on the planet. In reality, the  ocean is alive with an incredibly tiny marine worm that glows  phosphorescently. The light generated from those billions of worms is  reflected back from the clouds, makes Venus eternally lighted.\"\n\n\n He turned the ship to the North, relaxed a bit on the air bunk. He  felt tired and worn, his body aching from the space bends of a few  hours before.\n\n\n \"Take over,\" he said wearily. \"Take the ship North, and watch for any  island.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, rested his long hands on the controls. The space  cruiser lifted a bit in a sudden spurt of speed, and the rocket-sound  was a solid thrum of unleashed power.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit a cigarette, leaned toward a vision port. He felt again  that thrill he had experienced when he had first flashed his single-man  cruiser through the clouds years before. Then the breath caught in his  throat, and he tapped his companion's arm.\n\n\n \"Take a look!\" he called excitedly.\n\n\n They fought in the ocean below, fought in a never-ending splashing of  what seemed to be liquid fire. It was like watching a tri-dim screen of  a news event, except for the utter lack of sound.\n\n\n One was scaly, while the other was skinned, and both were fully three  hundred feet long. Great scimitars of teeth flashed in the light, and  blood gouted and stained the water crimson whenever a slashing blow was  struck. They threshed in a mad paroxysm of rage, whirling and spinning  in the phosphorescent water like beings from a nightmare, exploding  out of their element time and again, only to fall back in a gargantuan  spray of fluorescence.\n\n\n And then the scaly monster flashed in a half-turn, drove forward with  jaws agape, wrenched and ripped at the smooth black throat of the other  creature. The second creature rippled and undulated in agony, whipping  the ocean to foam, then went limp. The victorious monster circled the  body of its dead foe, then, majestically, plunged from sight into the  ocean's depths. An instant later, the water frothed, as hundreds of  lesser marine monsters attacked and fed on the floating corpse.\n\n\n \"Brrrr!\" Splinter shivered in sudden horror.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled dryly. \"Feel like going for a swim?\" he asked  conversationally.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head, watched the scene disappear from view to the  rear of the line of flight, then sank back onto his bunk.\n\n\n \"Not me!\" he said deprecatingly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled again, swung the cruiser toward the tiny smudge of  black on the horizon. Glowing water flashed beneath the ship, seeming  to smooth into a gleaming mirror shot with dancing colors. There was no  sign of life anywhere.\n\n\n Thirty minutes later, Kerry Blane circled the island that floated  free in the phosphorescent ocean. His keen eyes searched the tangled  luxuriant growth of the jungle below, searching for some indication  that the protoplasmic monster he seeked was there.\n\n\n \"I don't see anything suspicious,\" Splinter contributed.\n\n\n \"There's nothing special to see,\" Kerry Blane said shortly. \"As I  understand it, anyway, this chunk of animated appetite hangs around an  island shaped like a turtle. However, our orders are to investigate  every island, just in case there might be more than one of the  monsters.\"\n\n\n Splinter buckled on his dis-gun, excitement flaring in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Let's do a little exploring?\" he said eagerly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane shook his head, swung the cruiser north again.\n\n\n \"Plenty of time for that later,\" he said mildly. \"We'll find this  turtle-island, make a landing, and take a look around. Later, if we're  lucky enough to blow our objective to Kingdom Come, we'll do a little  exploring of the other islands.\"\n\n\n \"Hell!\" Splinter scowled in mock disgust. \"An old woman like you should  be taking in knitting for a living!\"\n\n\n \"Orders are orders!\" Kerry Blane shrugged. He swung the cruiser in a wide arc to the north, trebling the flying  speed within minutes, handling the controls with a familiar dexterity.  He said nothing, searched the gleaming ocean for the smudge of  blackness that would denote another island. His gaze flicked amusedly,  now and then, to the lanky Splinter who scowled moodily and toyed with  the dis-gun in his long hands.\n\n\n \"Cheer up, lad,\" Kerry Blane said finally. \"I think you'll find plenty  to occupy your time shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe?\" Splinter said gloomily.\n\n\n He idly swallowed another vitamin capsule, grinned, when he saw Kerry  Blane's automatic grimace of distaste. Then he yawned hugely, twisted  into a comfortable position, dozed sleepily.\n\n\n Kerry Blane rode the controls for the next three hours, searching the  limitless ocean for the few specks of islands that followed the slow  currents of the water planet. Always, there was the same misty light  surrounding the ship, never dimming, giving a sense of unreality to the  scene below. Nowhere was there the slightest sign of life until, in the  fourth hour of flight, a tiny dot of blackness came slowly over the  horizon's water line.\n\n\n Kerry Blane spun the ship in a tight circle, sent it flashing to the  west. His keen eyes lighted, when he finally made out the turtle-like  outline of the island, and he whistled softly, off-key, as he nudged  the snoring Splinter.\n\n\n \"This is it, Sleeping Beauty,\" he called. \"Snap out of it!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Whuzzat?\" Splinter grunted, rolled to his elbow.\n\n\n \"Here's the island.\"\n\n\n \"Oh!\" Splinter swung his feet from the bunk, peered from the vision  port, sleepiness instantly erased from his face.\n\n\n \"Hot damn!\" he chortled. \"Now we'll see a little action!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, tried to conceal the excitement he felt. He shook  his head, his fingers flickering over the control studs.\n\n\n \"Don't get your hopes too high, lad,\" he counseled. \"With those super  Zelta guns, it won't take ten minutes to wipe out that monster.\"\n\n\n Splinter rubbed his hands together, sighed like a boy seeing his first  circus. \"Listen, for ten minutes of that, I'd ride this chunk of metal  for a year!\"\n\n\n \"Could be!\" Kerry Blane agreed.\n\n\n He peered through the port, seeking any spot clear enough for a landing  field. Except for a strip of open beach, the island was a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n\n\n \"Belt yourself,\" Kerry Blane warned. \"If that beach isn't solid, I'll  have to lift the ship in a hell of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter's fingers were all thumbs in his excitement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane set the controls for a shallow glide, his fingers moving  like a concert pianist's. The cruiser yawed slightly, settled slowly  in a flat shallow glide.\n\n\n \"We're going in,\" Kerry Blane said quietly.\n\n\n He closed a knife switch, seeing too late the vitamin capsule that was  lodged in the slot. There was the sharp splutter of a short-circuit,  and a thin tendril of smoke drifted upward.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" Kerry Blane swore briefly.\n\n\n There was an instant, terrific explosion of the stern jets, and the  cruiser hurtled toward the beach like a gravity-crazed comet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane said absolutely nothing, his breath driven from him by the  suck of inertia. His hands darted for the controls, seeking to balance  the forces that threw the ship about like a toy. He cut all rockets  with a smashing swoop of his hand, tried to fire the bow rockets. But  the short had ruined the entire control system.\n\n\n For one interminable second, he saw the uncanny uprush of the island  below. He flicked his gaze about, saw the instant terror that wiped  all other expression from his young companion's face. Then the cruiser  plowed into the silvery sand.\n\n\n Belts parted like rotten string; they were thrown forward with crushing  force against the control panel. They groped feebly for support, their  bodies twisting involuntarily, as the ship cartwheeled a dozen times in  a few seconds. Almost instantly, consciousness was battered from them.\n\n\n With one final, grinding bounce, the cruiser rolled to its side,  twisted over and over for a hundred yards, then came to a metal-ripping  stop against a moss-grown boulder at the water's edge. III\n\n\n Kerry Blane choked, tried to turn his head from the water that trickled  into his face. He opened his eyes, stared blankly, uncomprehendingly  into the bloody features of the man bending over him.\n\n\n \"What happened?\" he gasped.\n\n\n Splinter Wood laughed, almost hysterically, mopped at his forehead with  a wet handkerchief.\n\n\n \"I thought you were dead!\" he said simply.\n\n\n Kerry Blane moved his arm experimentally, felt broken bones grate in  an exquisite wave of pain. He fought back the nausea, gazed about the  cabin, realized the ship lay on its side.\n\n\n \"Maybe I am,\" he said ruefully. \"No man could live through that crash.\"\n\n\n Splinter moved away, sat down tiredly on the edge of a bunk. He shook  his head dazedly, inspected the long cut on his leg.\n\n\n \"We seem to have done it,\" he said dully.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded, clambered to his feet, favoring his broken arm.  He leaned over the control panel, inspecting the dials with a worried  gaze. Slowly, his eyes lightened, and his voice was almost cheerful as  he swung about.\n\n\n \"Everything is more or less okay,\" he said. \"The board will have to  be rewired, but nothing else seems to be damaged so that repairs are  needed.\"\n\n\n Splinter looked up from his task of bandaging his leg. \"What caused  the crash?\" he asked. \"One minute, everything was all right; the next,  Blooey!\"\n\n\n Anger suddenly mottled Kerry Blane's face; he swore monotonously and  bitterly for a moment.\n\n\n \"Those gol-damned pills you been taking caused the crash!\" he roared.  \"One of them broke and shorted out the control board.\" He scowled at  the incredulous Splinter. \"By the three tails of a Martian sand-pup, I  ought to cram the rest of them down your throat, boxes and all!\"\n\n\n Splinter flushed, seemed to be fumbling for words. After a bit, Kerry  Blane grinned.\n\n\n \"Forget it, lad,\" he said more kindly, \"those things happen. Now, if  you'll bind a splint about my arm, we'll see what we can do about  righting the ship.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, opened the medical locker, worked with tape and  splints for minutes. Great beads of perspiration stood out in high  relief on Kerry Blane's forehead, but he made no sound. At last,  Splinter finished, tucked the supplies away.\n\n\n \"Now what?\" he asked subduedly.\n\n\n \"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. Can't tell but  what that protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit  in the near future!\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter unscrewed the port cogs, swung the portal back.\n\n\n He swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the  older man. After much puffing and grunting, Kerry Blane managed to  clamber through the port. They stood for a moment in silent wonder,  staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled  endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like  trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\n\n\n \"How big do you feel now?\" Kerry Blane asked quietly.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was silent, awed by the beauty and the tremendous size of  the growths on the water world.\n\n\n Kerry Blane walked the length of the cruiser, examining the slight  damage done by the crash, evaluating the situation with a practiced  gaze. He nodded slowly, retraced his steps, and stood looking at the  furrow plowed in the sand.\n\n\n \"Won't be any trouble at all to lift the ship,\" he called. \"After  rewiring the board, we'll turn the ship with an underjet, swing it  about, and head her toward the sea.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, dropped into the open port. A moment later, he flipped  a rope ladder outside, where it dangled to the ground, then climbed out  himself, carrying the two Zelta guns.\n\n\n \"We'd better test these,\" he said. \"We don't want any slip-ups when we  do go into action.\"\n\n\n He climbed down the ladder, laid the guns aside, then reached up a  hand to aid Kerry Blane's descent. Kerry Blane came down slowly and  awkwardly, jumped the last few feet. He felt surprisingly light and  strong in the lesser gravity.\n\n\n He stood, leaning against the ship, watching as Splinter picked up  the first gun and leveled it at a gigantic tree. Splinter sighted  carefully, winked at the older man, then pressed the firing stud.\n\n\n Nothing happened; there was no hissing crackle of released energy.\n\n\n Kerry Blane strode forward, puzzlement on his lined face, his hand  out-stretched toward the defective weapon. Splinter gaped at the gun in  his hands, held it out wordlessly.\n\n\n \"The crash must have broken something,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head. \"There's only one moving part,\" he said, \"and  that's the force gate on the firing stud.\"\n\n\n \"Try the other,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n \"Okay!\"\n\n\n Splinter lifted the second gun, pressed the stud, gazed white-faced at  his companion.\n\n\n \"It won't work, either,\" he said stupidly. \"I don't get it? The source  of power is limitless. Solar rays never\u2014\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane dropped the first gun to his side, swore harshly.\n\n\n \"Damn it,\" he said. \"They didn't think of it; you didn't think of it;  and I most certainly forgot! Solar rays can't penetrate the miles of  clouds on Venus. Those guns are utterly useless as weapons!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are the islands of Venus?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Exposed continental plates risen to the surface from tectonics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Floating pads covered in jungle\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Floating pads covered in jungle\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent\u2019s \u201ctectonic plates\u201d theory fails on both textual and logical grounds. In contrast, the story clearly describes Venus\u2019s islands as floating jungle mats\u2014vegetation-covered rafts\u2014so \u201cfloating pads covered in jungle\u201d is the only answer supported by the background.\n\n1. The text explicitly calls them floating islands.  \n   \u2022 \u201cNow, the ship lay on its side, twisted over and over\u2026 the cruiser rolled to its side\u2026 Then they stood\u2026 staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\u201d (Ch. III)  \n   \u2022 And earlier, Blane scopes \u201cthe tiny smudge of black on the horizon\u201d and identifies it as \u201canother island\u201d which \u201cfloated free in the phosphorescent ocean.\u201d (Ch. II)  \n   Both passages make clear that these islands are literally floating atop Venus\u2019s sea.\n\n2. There is no solid continental crust on Venus\u2019s water world.  \n   \u2022 Venus is depicted as a true \u201cWater-world\u201d\u2014a planet entirely covered by an ocean of glowing creatures. Tectonic plates require a rigid lithosphere beneath the sea; none exists here. The story never mentions any underlying land or rocky shelf\u2014only water and floating vegetation.  \n   \u2022 The wanderer islands drifted \u201cwith the slow currents of the water planet,\u201d something tectonic plates couldn\u2019t do. Continental plates move centimeters per year, not carried along on surface currents. \n\n3. The islands support dense jungle growth atop buoyant material.  \n   \u2022 Blane and Wood prepare to land on a narrow \u201cstrip of open beach\u201d surrounded by \u201ca solid mass of heavy fern-like growth.\u201d (Ch. II) The only plausible substrate for such towering ferns on an ocean world is a buoyant mat of plant debris and root networks\u2014i.e., floating pads.  \n   \u2022 Tectonic uplift would produce rock shores, not soft jungle beaches. Yet Blane and Wood find a \u201csilvery sand\u201d beach likely formed by decaying vegetation, not eroded rock.\n\n4. Floating pads explain why the Zelta-guns can\u2019t penetrate.  \n   \u2022 When they finally crash on the island, their solar-powered weapons fail, because \u201csolar rays can\u2019t penetrate the miles of clouds on Venus.\u201d (Ch. III) That only makes sense if these islands sit atop the phosphorescent sea\u2014flowers and ferns soaking up diffuse light\u2014rather than solid rock. If they were continental plates, at least some rocky outcrop would absorb ambient radiation differently.\n\nDebater_B\u2019s exposed-plate idea contradicts every detail: drifting islands, no mention of rock, jungles at sea level, and powerless solar guns underscoring the lack of sunlight. By contrast, \u201cfloating pads covered in jungle\u201d accounts for drifting behavior, supports lush vegetation, and matches the story\u2019s repeated emphasis on floating landmasses. Therefore the islands of Venus are indisputably floating vegetation pads, not tectonic plates.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position\u2014that Venus\u2019s islands are exposed continental plates uplifted by tectonic forces\u2014better fits the text than A\u2019s \u201cfloating jungle pads.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Solid Ground and Beach  \n  \u2022 After the crash, Blane notes a \u201csilvery sand\u201d beach and an undercut \u201cmoss-grown boulder at the water\u2019s edge.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cthe cruiser plowed into the silvery sand. \u2026 against a moss-grown boulder at the water\u2019s edge.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 If these islands were merely buoyant vegetation mats, they couldn\u2019t support large boulders cemented with moss. That implies a stable, rocky substrate\u2014i.e., continental crust.\n\n2. Furrow and Ship Righting  \n  \u2022 Blane observes \u201cthe furrow plowed in the sand\u201d by the cruiser and immediately plans to \u201clift the ship, swing it about, and head her toward the sea.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cLet\u2019s take a look outside \u2026 We seem to have done it \u2026 the furrow plowed in the sand. \u2026 After rewiring \u2026 we\u2019ll \u2026 head her toward the sea.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 On a floating mat, a heavy ship would simply punch through or flex the pad, not leave a neat trench in solid sand.\n\n3. Island Shape and Permanence  \n  \u2022 Blane expects the monster to haunt \u201can island shaped like a turtle.\u201d Such detailed, stable topography points to a rigid landform, not a shifting mat of jungle. Vegetation mats tend to deform, not hold precise shapes like a turtle outline.\n\n4. Vegetation Rooted in Soil  \n  \u2022 The text describes \u201cthe tangled luxuriant growth of the jungle\u201d spread \u201csolid\u201d across the island. <quote> a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n</quote> Plants need soil, not floating waterlogged mats. A continental shelf remnant provides the soil depth necessary for trees hundreds of feet tall.\n\nWhy Debater_A\u2019s \u201cfloating pads\u201d fails:  \n  \u2022 There\u2019s no hint in the story of algal or root mats thick enough to bear that structure.  \n  \u2022 Blane and Wood treat the islands as land when exploring (\u201cclamber through the port,\u201d \u201cstand for a moment \u2026 staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence\u201d). They never encounter any instability or wet, spongy ground typical of floating mats.  \n  \u2022 The moss-covered boulder and sand beach are geologic, not botanical, features.\n\nIn sum, only the tectonic-uplift model explains stable rocky beaches, boulders, furrows from a heavy vessel, and dense jungle rooted in soil. Therefore, the islands of Venus in Peacock\u2019s story must be exposed continental plates risen to the surface by tectonic forces.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Floating pads covered in jungle\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

PEACOCK The orders were explicit: \"Destroy the\n\n 'THING' of Venus.\" But Patrolmen Kerry\n\n Blane and Splinter Wood, their space-ship\n\n wrecked, could not follow orders\u2014their\n\n weapons were useless on the Water-world.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Old Kerry Blane exploded.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" he roared. \"I don't like you; and I don't like this ship;  and I don't like the assignment; and I don't like those infernal pills  you keep eating; and I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Splinter\" Wood grinned.\n\n\n \"Seems to me, Kerry,\" he remarked humorously, \"that you don't like much  of anything!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane growled unintelligibly, batted the injector lever with a  calloused hand. His grizzled hair was a stiff wiry mop on his small  head, and his oversize jaw was thrust belligerently forward. But deep  within his eyes, where he hoped it was hidden, was a friendly twinkle  that gave the lie to his speech.\n\n\n \"You're a squirt!\" he snapped disagreeably. \"You're not dry behind  the ears, yet. You're like the rest of these kids who call themselves  pilots\u2014only more so! And why the hell the chief had to sic you on me,  on an exploration trip this important\u2014well, I'll never understand.\"\n\n\n Splinter rolled his six foot three of lanky body into a more  comfortable position on the air-bunk. He yawned tremendously, fumbled a  small box from his shirt pocket, and removed a marble-like capsule.\n\n\n \"Better take one of these,\" he warned. \"You're liable to get the space  bends at any moment.\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane snorted, batted the box aside impatiently, scowled  moodily at the capsules that bounced for a moment against the pilot  room's walls before hanging motionless in the air.\n\n\n \"Mister Wood,\" he said icily, \"I was flying a space ship while they  were changing your pants twenty times a day. When I want advice on how  to fly a ship, how to cure space bends, how to handle a Zelta ray, or  how to spit\u2014I'll ask you! Until then, you and your bloody marbles can  go plumb straight to the devil!\"\n\n\n \"Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!\" Splinter reached out lazily, plucked the capsules from  the air, one by one.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit one of the five allotted cigarettes of the day.\n\n\n \"Don't 'tsk' me, you young squirt,\" he grunted around a mouthful of  fragrant smoke. \"I know all the arguments you can put up; ain't that  all I been hearing for a week? You take your vitamins A, B, C, D, all  you want, but you leave me alone\u2014or I'll stuff your head down your  throat, P.D.Q.!\"\n\n\n \"All right, all right!\" Splinter tucked the capsule box back into his  pocket, grinned mockingly. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. With this  shielded ship, and with no sunlight reaching Venus' surface, you're  gonna be begging for some of my vitamin, super-concentrated pills  before we get back to Earth.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane made a rich, ripe noise with his mouth.\n\n\n \"Pfuii!\" he said very distinctly.\n\n\n \"Gracious!\" Splinter said in mock horror. They made a strange contrast as they lay in their air bunks. Splinter  was fully a head taller than the dour Irishman, and his lanky build  gave a false impression of awkwardness. While the vitriolic Kerry Blane  was short and compact, strength and quickness evident in every movement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane had flown every type of ship that rode in space. In the  passing years, he had flight-tested almost every new experimental ship,  had flown them with increasing skill, had earned a reputation as a  trouble shooter on any kind of craft.\n\n\n But even Kerry Blane had to retire eventually.\n\n\n A great retirement banquet had been given in his honor by the  Interplanetary Squadron. There had been the usual speeches and  presentations; and Kerry Blane had heard them all, had thanked the  donors of the gifts. But it was not until the next morning, when he was  dressed in civilian clothes for the first time in forty years, that he  realized the enormity of the thing that had happened to his life.\n\n\n Something died within Kerry Blane's heart that morning, shriveled and  passed away, leaving him suddenly shrunken and old. He had become like  a rusty old freighter couched between the gleaming bodies of great  space warriors.\n\n\n Finally, as a last resort so that he would not be thrown entirely  aside, he had taken a desk job in the squadron offices. For six years  he had dry-rotted there, waiting hopefully for the moment when his  active services would be needed again.\n\n\n It was there that he had met and liked the ungainly Splinter Wood.  There was something in the boy that had found a kindred spirit in Kerry  Blane's heart, and he had taken the youngster in hand to give him the  benefits of experience that had become legendary.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was a probationary pilot, had been admitted to the  Interplanetary Squadron because of his inherent skill, even though his  formal education had been fairly well neglected. Now, the two of them rode the pounding jets of a DX cruiser, bound  for Venus to make a personal survey of its floating islands for the  Interplanetary Squadron's Medical Division.\n\n\n \"Ten to one we don't get back!\" Splinter said pessimistically.\n\n\n Kerry Blane scrubbed out his cigarette, scowled bleakly at the  instrument panel. He sensed the faint thread of fear in the youngster's  tone, and a nostalgic twinge touched his heart, for he was remembering  the days of his youth when he had a full life to look forward to.\n\n\n \"If you're afraid, you can get out and walk back,\" he snapped  disagreeably.\n\n\n A grin lifted the corners of Splinter's long mouth, spread into his  eyes. His hand unconsciously came up, touched the tiny squadron pin on  his lapel.\n\n\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, glory grabber,\" he said mockingly, \"but I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"\n\n\n \" Me! You've got orders to take care of me ?\" Kerry Blane choked  incoherently for a moment, red tiding cholerically upward from his  loosened collar.\n\n\n \"Of course!\" Splinter grinned.\n\n\n Kerry Blane exploded, words spewing volcanically forth. Splinter  relaxed, his booted foot beating out a dull rhythm to the colorful  language learned through almost fifty years of spacing. And at last,  when Kerry Blane had quieted until he but smoldered, he leaned over and  touched the old spacer on the sleeve.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight!\" he remarked pleasantly.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight what?\" Kerry Blane asked sullenly, the old twinkle  beginning to light again deep in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight new words\u2014and you swore them beautifully!\" Splinter  beamed. \"Some day you can teach them to me.\"\n\n\n They laughed then, Old Kerry Blane and young Splinter Wood, and  the warmth of their friendship was a tangible thing in the small  control-room of the cruiser.\n\n\n And in the midst of their laughter, Old Kerry Blane choked in agony,  surged desperately against his bunk straps.\n\n\n He screamed unknowingly, feeling only the horrible excruciating agony  of his body, tasting the blood that gushed from his mouth and nostrils.  His muscles were knotted cords that he could not loosen, and his blood  was a surging stream that pounded at his throbbing temples. The air he  breathed seemed to be molten flame.\n\n\n His body arced again and again against the restraining straps, and his  mouth was open in a soundless scream. He sensed dimly that his partner  had wrenched open a wall door, removed metal medicine kits, and was  fumbling through their contents. He felt the bite of the hypodermic,  felt a deadly numbness replace the raging torment that had been his  for seconds. He swallowed three capsules automatically, passed into a  coma-like sleep, woke hours later to stare clear-eyed into Splinter's  concerned face.\n\n\n \"Close, wasn't it?\" he said weakly, conversationally.\n\n\n \"Close enough!\" Splinter agreed relievedly. \"If you had followed my  advice and taken those vitamin capsules, you'd never have had the  bends.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, winced when he felt the dull ache in his body.\n\n\n \"I've had the bends before, and lived through them!\" he said, still  weakly defiant.\n\n\n \"That's the past,\" Splinter said quietly. \"This is the present, and you  take your pills every day, just as I do\u2014from now on.\"\n\n\n \"All right\u2014and thanks!\"\n\n\n \"Forget it!\" Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\n\n\n A buzzer sounded from the instrument panel, and a tiny light glowed  redly.\n\n\n \"Six hours more,\" Splinter said, turned to the instrument panel.\n\n\n His long hands played over the instrument panel, checking, controlling  the rocket fire, adjusting delicate instruments to hairline marks.  Kerry Blane nodded in silent approval.\n\n\n They could feel the first tug of gravity on their bodies, and through  the vision port could see the greenish ball that was cloud-covered  Venus. Excitement lifted their spirits, brought light to their eyes as  they peered eagerly ahead.\n\n\n \"What's it really like?\" Splinter asked impatiently.\n\n\n Kerry Blane yawned, settled back luxuriously. \"I'll tell you later,\" he  said, \"I'm going to take a nap and try to ease this bellyache of mine.  Wake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky  place to set a ship on.\"\n\n\n He yawned again, drifted instantly into sleep, relaxing with the  ability of a spaceman who sleeps when and if he can. Splinter smiled  down at his sleeping partner, then turned back to the quartzite port.  He shook his head a bit, remembering the stories he had heard about the  water planet, wondering\u2014wondering\u2014 II\n\n\n Venus was a fluffy cotton ball hanging motionless in bottomless  space. Far to the left, Mercury gleamed like a polished diamond in  the sunlight. Kerry Blane cut the driving rockets, let the cruiser  sink into a fast gravity-dive, guiding it only now and then by a brief  flicker of a side jet.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched breathlessly from the vision port, his long face  eager and reckless, his eyes seeking to pierce the clouds that roiled  and twisted uneasily over the surface of the planet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane glanced tolerantly at his young companion, felt a nostalgic  tug at his heart when he remembered the first time he had approached  the water-planet years before. Then, he had been a young and reckless  firebrand, his fame already spreading, an unquenchable fire of  adventure flaming in his heart.\n\n\n Now, his aged but steady fingers rested lightly on the controls,  brought the patrol cruiser closer to the cloud-banks on the line of  demarcation between the sunward and sunless sides of the planet. He  hummed tunelessly, strangely happy, as he peered ahead.\n\n\n \"Val Kenton died there,\" Splinter whispered softly, \"Died to save the  lives of three other people!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, and his voice changed subtly.  \"Val was a blackguard, a criminal; but he died in the best traditions  of the service.\" He sighed. \"He never had a chance.\"\n\n\n \"Murdered!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane smiled grimly. \"I guess I used too broad an interpretation  of the word,\" he said gently. \"Anyway, one of our main tasks is to  destroy the thing that killed him.\"\n\n\n His lean fingers tightened unconsciously.\n\n\n \"I'd like nothing better than to turn a Zelta-blaster on that chunk of  living protoplasm and cremate it.\"\n\n\n Splinters shivered slightly. \"Do you think we'll find it?\" he asked.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"I think it will find us; after all, it's just an  animated appetite looking for food.\"\n\n\n He turned back to the controls, flipped a switch, and the cutting of  the nose rocket dropped the ship in an angling glide toward the clouds  a few miles below. Gravity was full strength now, and although not as  great as Earth's, was still strong enough to bring a sense of giddiness  to the men.\n\n\n \"Here we go!\" Splinter said tonelessly.\n\n\n The great cottony batts of roiling clouds rushed up to meet the ship,  bringing the first sense of violent movement in more than a week of  flying. There was something awesome and breath-taking in the speed with  which the ship dropped toward the planet.\n\n\n Tendrils of vapor touched the ports, were whipped aside, then were  replaced by heavier fingers of cloud. Kerry Blane pressed a firing  stud, and nose rockets thrummed in a rising crescendo as the free fall  of the cruiser was checked. Heat rose in the cabin from the friction of  the outer air, then dissipated, as the force-screen voltometer leaped  higher.\n\n\n Then, as though it had never been, the sun disappeared, and there was  only a gray blankness pressing about the ship. Gone was all sense of  movement, and the ship seemed to hover in a gray nothingness.\n\n\n Kerry Blane crouched over the control panel, his hands moving deftly,  his eyes flicking from one instrument to another. Tiny lines of  concentration etched themselves about his mouth, and perspiration  beaded his forehead. He rode that cruiser through the miles of clouds  through sheer instinctive ability, seeming to fly it as though he were  an integral part of the ship.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched him with awe in his eyes, seeing for the first  time the incredible instinct that had made Kerry Blane the idol of a  billion people. He relaxed visibly, all instinctive fear allayed by the  brilliant competence of his companion.\n\n\n Seconds flowed into moments, and the moments merged into one another,  and still the clouds pressed with a visible strength against the  ports. The rockets drummed steadily, holding the ship aloft, dropping  it slowly toward the planet below. Then the clouds thinned, and,  incredibly, were permeated with a dim and glowing light. A second  later, and the clouds were gone, and a thousand feet below tumbled and  tossed in a majestic display of ruthless strength an ocean that seemed  to be composed of liquid fluorescence.\n\n\n Kerry Blane heard Splinter's instant sigh of unbelief.\n\n\n \"Good Lord!\" Splinter said, \"What\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice stilled, and he was silent, his eyes drinking in the weird  incredible scene below. The ocean was a shifting, white-capped wash of silvery light that  gleamed with a bright phosphorescence of a hundred, intermingled,  kaleidoscopic colors. And the unreal, unearthly light continued  unbroken everywhere, reflected from the low-hanging clouds, reaching  to the far horizon, bathing every detail of the planet in a brilliance  more bright than moonlight.\n\n\n Splinter turned a wondering face. \"But the official reports say that  there is no light on Venus,\" he exclaimed. \"That was one of the reasons  given when exploration was forbidden!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"That was merely a pretext to keep foolhardy  spacemen from losing their lives on the planet. In reality, the  ocean is alive with an incredibly tiny marine worm that glows  phosphorescently. The light generated from those billions of worms is  reflected back from the clouds, makes Venus eternally lighted.\"\n\n\n He turned the ship to the North, relaxed a bit on the air bunk. He  felt tired and worn, his body aching from the space bends of a few  hours before.\n\n\n \"Take over,\" he said wearily. \"Take the ship North, and watch for any  island.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, rested his long hands on the controls. The space  cruiser lifted a bit in a sudden spurt of speed, and the rocket-sound  was a solid thrum of unleashed power.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit a cigarette, leaned toward a vision port. He felt again  that thrill he had experienced when he had first flashed his single-man  cruiser through the clouds years before. Then the breath caught in his  throat, and he tapped his companion's arm.\n\n\n \"Take a look!\" he called excitedly.\n\n\n They fought in the ocean below, fought in a never-ending splashing of  what seemed to be liquid fire. It was like watching a tri-dim screen of  a news event, except for the utter lack of sound.\n\n\n One was scaly, while the other was skinned, and both were fully three  hundred feet long. Great scimitars of teeth flashed in the light, and  blood gouted and stained the water crimson whenever a slashing blow was  struck. They threshed in a mad paroxysm of rage, whirling and spinning  in the phosphorescent water like beings from a nightmare, exploding  out of their element time and again, only to fall back in a gargantuan  spray of fluorescence.\n\n\n And then the scaly monster flashed in a half-turn, drove forward with  jaws agape, wrenched and ripped at the smooth black throat of the other  creature. The second creature rippled and undulated in agony, whipping  the ocean to foam, then went limp. The victorious monster circled the  body of its dead foe, then, majestically, plunged from sight into the  ocean's depths. An instant later, the water frothed, as hundreds of  lesser marine monsters attacked and fed on the floating corpse.\n\n\n \"Brrrr!\" Splinter shivered in sudden horror.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled dryly. \"Feel like going for a swim?\" he asked  conversationally.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head, watched the scene disappear from view to the  rear of the line of flight, then sank back onto his bunk.\n\n\n \"Not me!\" he said deprecatingly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled again, swung the cruiser toward the tiny smudge of  black on the horizon. Glowing water flashed beneath the ship, seeming  to smooth into a gleaming mirror shot with dancing colors. There was no  sign of life anywhere.\n\n\n Thirty minutes later, Kerry Blane circled the island that floated  free in the phosphorescent ocean. His keen eyes searched the tangled  luxuriant growth of the jungle below, searching for some indication  that the protoplasmic monster he seeked was there.\n\n\n \"I don't see anything suspicious,\" Splinter contributed.\n\n\n \"There's nothing special to see,\" Kerry Blane said shortly. \"As I  understand it, anyway, this chunk of animated appetite hangs around an  island shaped like a turtle. However, our orders are to investigate  every island, just in case there might be more than one of the  monsters.\"\n\n\n Splinter buckled on his dis-gun, excitement flaring in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Let's do a little exploring?\" he said eagerly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane shook his head, swung the cruiser north again.\n\n\n \"Plenty of time for that later,\" he said mildly. \"We'll find this  turtle-island, make a landing, and take a look around. Later, if we're  lucky enough to blow our objective to Kingdom Come, we'll do a little  exploring of the other islands.\"\n\n\n \"Hell!\" Splinter scowled in mock disgust. \"An old woman like you should  be taking in knitting for a living!\"\n\n\n \"Orders are orders!\" Kerry Blane shrugged. He swung the cruiser in a wide arc to the north, trebling the flying  speed within minutes, handling the controls with a familiar dexterity.  He said nothing, searched the gleaming ocean for the smudge of  blackness that would denote another island. His gaze flicked amusedly,  now and then, to the lanky Splinter who scowled moodily and toyed with  the dis-gun in his long hands.\n\n\n \"Cheer up, lad,\" Kerry Blane said finally. \"I think you'll find plenty  to occupy your time shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe?\" Splinter said gloomily.\n\n\n He idly swallowed another vitamin capsule, grinned, when he saw Kerry  Blane's automatic grimace of distaste. Then he yawned hugely, twisted  into a comfortable position, dozed sleepily.\n\n\n Kerry Blane rode the controls for the next three hours, searching the  limitless ocean for the few specks of islands that followed the slow  currents of the water planet. Always, there was the same misty light  surrounding the ship, never dimming, giving a sense of unreality to the  scene below. Nowhere was there the slightest sign of life until, in the  fourth hour of flight, a tiny dot of blackness came slowly over the  horizon's water line.\n\n\n Kerry Blane spun the ship in a tight circle, sent it flashing to the  west. His keen eyes lighted, when he finally made out the turtle-like  outline of the island, and he whistled softly, off-key, as he nudged  the snoring Splinter.\n\n\n \"This is it, Sleeping Beauty,\" he called. \"Snap out of it!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Whuzzat?\" Splinter grunted, rolled to his elbow.\n\n\n \"Here's the island.\"\n\n\n \"Oh!\" Splinter swung his feet from the bunk, peered from the vision  port, sleepiness instantly erased from his face.\n\n\n \"Hot damn!\" he chortled. \"Now we'll see a little action!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, tried to conceal the excitement he felt. He shook  his head, his fingers flickering over the control studs.\n\n\n \"Don't get your hopes too high, lad,\" he counseled. \"With those super  Zelta guns, it won't take ten minutes to wipe out that monster.\"\n\n\n Splinter rubbed his hands together, sighed like a boy seeing his first  circus. \"Listen, for ten minutes of that, I'd ride this chunk of metal  for a year!\"\n\n\n \"Could be!\" Kerry Blane agreed.\n\n\n He peered through the port, seeking any spot clear enough for a landing  field. Except for a strip of open beach, the island was a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n\n\n \"Belt yourself,\" Kerry Blane warned. \"If that beach isn't solid, I'll  have to lift the ship in a hell of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter's fingers were all thumbs in his excitement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane set the controls for a shallow glide, his fingers moving  like a concert pianist's. The cruiser yawed slightly, settled slowly  in a flat shallow glide.\n\n\n \"We're going in,\" Kerry Blane said quietly.\n\n\n He closed a knife switch, seeing too late the vitamin capsule that was  lodged in the slot. There was the sharp splutter of a short-circuit,  and a thin tendril of smoke drifted upward.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" Kerry Blane swore briefly.\n\n\n There was an instant, terrific explosion of the stern jets, and the  cruiser hurtled toward the beach like a gravity-crazed comet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane said absolutely nothing, his breath driven from him by the  suck of inertia. His hands darted for the controls, seeking to balance  the forces that threw the ship about like a toy. He cut all rockets  with a smashing swoop of his hand, tried to fire the bow rockets. But  the short had ruined the entire control system.\n\n\n For one interminable second, he saw the uncanny uprush of the island  below. He flicked his gaze about, saw the instant terror that wiped  all other expression from his young companion's face. Then the cruiser  plowed into the silvery sand.\n\n\n Belts parted like rotten string; they were thrown forward with crushing  force against the control panel. They groped feebly for support, their  bodies twisting involuntarily, as the ship cartwheeled a dozen times in  a few seconds. Almost instantly, consciousness was battered from them.\n\n\n With one final, grinding bounce, the cruiser rolled to its side,  twisted over and over for a hundred yards, then came to a metal-ripping  stop against a moss-grown boulder at the water's edge. III\n\n\n Kerry Blane choked, tried to turn his head from the water that trickled  into his face. He opened his eyes, stared blankly, uncomprehendingly  into the bloody features of the man bending over him.\n\n\n \"What happened?\" he gasped.\n\n\n Splinter Wood laughed, almost hysterically, mopped at his forehead with  a wet handkerchief.\n\n\n \"I thought you were dead!\" he said simply.\n\n\n Kerry Blane moved his arm experimentally, felt broken bones grate in  an exquisite wave of pain. He fought back the nausea, gazed about the  cabin, realized the ship lay on its side.\n\n\n \"Maybe I am,\" he said ruefully. \"No man could live through that crash.\"\n\n\n Splinter moved away, sat down tiredly on the edge of a bunk. He shook  his head dazedly, inspected the long cut on his leg.\n\n\n \"We seem to have done it,\" he said dully.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded, clambered to his feet, favoring his broken arm.  He leaned over the control panel, inspecting the dials with a worried  gaze. Slowly, his eyes lightened, and his voice was almost cheerful as  he swung about.\n\n\n \"Everything is more or less okay,\" he said. \"The board will have to  be rewired, but nothing else seems to be damaged so that repairs are  needed.\"\n\n\n Splinter looked up from his task of bandaging his leg. \"What caused  the crash?\" he asked. \"One minute, everything was all right; the next,  Blooey!\"\n\n\n Anger suddenly mottled Kerry Blane's face; he swore monotonously and  bitterly for a moment.\n\n\n \"Those gol-damned pills you been taking caused the crash!\" he roared.  \"One of them broke and shorted out the control board.\" He scowled at  the incredulous Splinter. \"By the three tails of a Martian sand-pup, I  ought to cram the rest of them down your throat, boxes and all!\"\n\n\n Splinter flushed, seemed to be fumbling for words. After a bit, Kerry  Blane grinned.\n\n\n \"Forget it, lad,\" he said more kindly, \"those things happen. Now, if  you'll bind a splint about my arm, we'll see what we can do about  righting the ship.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, opened the medical locker, worked with tape and  splints for minutes. Great beads of perspiration stood out in high  relief on Kerry Blane's forehead, but he made no sound. At last,  Splinter finished, tucked the supplies away.\n\n\n \"Now what?\" he asked subduedly.\n\n\n \"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. Can't tell but  what that protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit  in the near future!\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter unscrewed the port cogs, swung the portal back.\n\n\n He swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the  older man. After much puffing and grunting, Kerry Blane managed to  clamber through the port. They stood for a moment in silent wonder,  staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled  endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like  trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\n\n\n \"How big do you feel now?\" Kerry Blane asked quietly.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was silent, awed by the beauty and the tremendous size of  the growths on the water world.\n\n\n Kerry Blane walked the length of the cruiser, examining the slight  damage done by the crash, evaluating the situation with a practiced  gaze. He nodded slowly, retraced his steps, and stood looking at the  furrow plowed in the sand.\n\n\n \"Won't be any trouble at all to lift the ship,\" he called. \"After  rewiring the board, we'll turn the ship with an underjet, swing it  about, and head her toward the sea.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, dropped into the open port. A moment later, he flipped  a rope ladder outside, where it dangled to the ground, then climbed out  himself, carrying the two Zelta guns.\n\n\n \"We'd better test these,\" he said. \"We don't want any slip-ups when we  do go into action.\"\n\n\n He climbed down the ladder, laid the guns aside, then reached up a  hand to aid Kerry Blane's descent. Kerry Blane came down slowly and  awkwardly, jumped the last few feet. He felt surprisingly light and  strong in the lesser gravity.\n\n\n He stood, leaning against the ship, watching as Splinter picked up  the first gun and leveled it at a gigantic tree. Splinter sighted  carefully, winked at the older man, then pressed the firing stud.\n\n\n Nothing happened; there was no hissing crackle of released energy.\n\n\n Kerry Blane strode forward, puzzlement on his lined face, his hand  out-stretched toward the defective weapon. Splinter gaped at the gun in  his hands, held it out wordlessly.\n\n\n \"The crash must have broken something,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head. \"There's only one moving part,\" he said, \"and  that's the force gate on the firing stud.\"\n\n\n \"Try the other,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n \"Okay!\"\n\n\n Splinter lifted the second gun, pressed the stud, gazed white-faced at  his companion.\n\n\n \"It won't work, either,\" he said stupidly. \"I don't get it? The source  of power is limitless. Solar rays never\u2014\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane dropped the first gun to his side, swore harshly.\n\n\n \"Damn it,\" he said. \"They didn't think of it; you didn't think of it;  and I most certainly forgot! Solar rays can't penetrate the miles of  clouds on Venus. Those guns are utterly useless as weapons!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are the islands of Venus?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Floating pads covered in jungle\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Exposed continental plates risen to the surface from tectonics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Exposed continental plates risen to the surface from tectonics\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position\u2014that Venus\u2019s islands are exposed continental plates uplifted by tectonic forces\u2014better fits the text than A\u2019s \u201cfloating jungle pads.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Solid Ground and Beach  \n  \u2022 After the crash, Blane notes a \u201csilvery sand\u201d beach and an undercut \u201cmoss-grown boulder at the water\u2019s edge.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cthe cruiser plowed into the silvery sand. \u2026 against a moss-grown boulder at the water\u2019s edge.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 If these islands were merely buoyant vegetation mats, they couldn\u2019t support large boulders cemented with moss. That implies a stable, rocky substrate\u2014i.e., continental crust.\n\n2. Furrow and Ship Righting  \n  \u2022 Blane observes \u201cthe furrow plowed in the sand\u201d by the cruiser and immediately plans to \u201clift the ship, swing it about, and head her toward the sea.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cLet\u2019s take a look outside \u2026 We seem to have done it \u2026 the furrow plowed in the sand. \u2026 After rewiring \u2026 we\u2019ll \u2026 head her toward the sea.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 On a floating mat, a heavy ship would simply punch through or flex the pad, not leave a neat trench in solid sand.\n\n3. Island Shape and Permanence  \n  \u2022 Blane expects the monster to haunt \u201can island shaped like a turtle.\u201d Such detailed, stable topography points to a rigid landform, not a shifting mat of jungle. Vegetation mats tend to deform, not hold precise shapes like a turtle outline.\n\n4. Vegetation Rooted in Soil  \n  \u2022 The text describes \u201cthe tangled luxuriant growth of the jungle\u201d spread \u201csolid\u201d across the island. <quote> a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n</quote> Plants need soil, not floating waterlogged mats. A continental shelf remnant provides the soil depth necessary for trees hundreds of feet tall.\n\nWhy Debater_A\u2019s \u201cfloating pads\u201d fails:  \n  \u2022 There\u2019s no hint in the story of algal or root mats thick enough to bear that structure.  \n  \u2022 Blane and Wood treat the islands as land when exploring (\u201cclamber through the port,\u201d \u201cstand for a moment \u2026 staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence\u201d). They never encounter any instability or wet, spongy ground typical of floating mats.  \n  \u2022 The moss-covered boulder and sand beach are geologic, not botanical, features.\n\nIn sum, only the tectonic-uplift model explains stable rocky beaches, boulders, furrows from a heavy vessel, and dense jungle rooted in soil. Therefore, the islands of Venus in Peacock\u2019s story must be exposed continental plates risen to the surface by tectonic forces.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent\u2019s \u201ctectonic plates\u201d theory fails on both textual and logical grounds. In contrast, the story clearly describes Venus\u2019s islands as floating jungle mats\u2014vegetation-covered rafts\u2014so \u201cfloating pads covered in jungle\u201d is the only answer supported by the background.\n\n1. The text explicitly calls them floating islands.  \n   \u2022 \u201cNow, the ship lay on its side, twisted over and over\u2026 the cruiser rolled to its side\u2026 Then they stood\u2026 staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\u201d (Ch. III)  \n   \u2022 And earlier, Blane scopes \u201cthe tiny smudge of black on the horizon\u201d and identifies it as \u201canother island\u201d which \u201cfloated free in the phosphorescent ocean.\u201d (Ch. II)  \n   Both passages make clear that these islands are literally floating atop Venus\u2019s sea.\n\n2. There is no solid continental crust on Venus\u2019s water world.  \n   \u2022 Venus is depicted as a true \u201cWater-world\u201d\u2014a planet entirely covered by an ocean of glowing creatures. Tectonic plates require a rigid lithosphere beneath the sea; none exists here. The story never mentions any underlying land or rocky shelf\u2014only water and floating vegetation.  \n   \u2022 The wanderer islands drifted \u201cwith the slow currents of the water planet,\u201d something tectonic plates couldn\u2019t do. Continental plates move centimeters per year, not carried along on surface currents. \n\n3. The islands support dense jungle growth atop buoyant material.  \n   \u2022 Blane and Wood prepare to land on a narrow \u201cstrip of open beach\u201d surrounded by \u201ca solid mass of heavy fern-like growth.\u201d (Ch. II) The only plausible substrate for such towering ferns on an ocean world is a buoyant mat of plant debris and root networks\u2014i.e., floating pads.  \n   \u2022 Tectonic uplift would produce rock shores, not soft jungle beaches. Yet Blane and Wood find a \u201csilvery sand\u201d beach likely formed by decaying vegetation, not eroded rock.\n\n4. Floating pads explain why the Zelta-guns can\u2019t penetrate.  \n   \u2022 When they finally crash on the island, their solar-powered weapons fail, because \u201csolar rays can\u2019t penetrate the miles of clouds on Venus.\u201d (Ch. III) That only makes sense if these islands sit atop the phosphorescent sea\u2014flowers and ferns soaking up diffuse light\u2014rather than solid rock. If they were continental plates, at least some rocky outcrop would absorb ambient radiation differently.\n\nDebater_B\u2019s exposed-plate idea contradicts every detail: drifting islands, no mention of rock, jungles at sea level, and powerless solar guns underscoring the lack of sunlight. By contrast, \u201cfloating pads covered in jungle\u201d accounts for drifting behavior, supports lush vegetation, and matches the story\u2019s repeated emphasis on floating landmasses. Therefore the islands of Venus are indisputably floating vegetation pads, not tectonic plates.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Exposed continental plates risen to the surface from tectonics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

If they were continental plates, at least some rocky outcrop would absorb ambient radiation differently.\n\nDebater_B\u2019s exposed-plate idea contradicts every detail: drifting islands, no mention of rock, jungles at sea level, and powerless solar guns underscoring the lack of sunlight. By contrast, \u201cfloating pads covered in jungle\u201d accounts for drifting behavior, supports lush vegetation, and matches the story\u2019s repeated emphasis on floating landmasses. Therefore the islands of Venus are indisputably floating vegetation pads, not tectonic plates.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nMy position\u2014that Venus\u2019s islands are exposed continental plates uplifted by tectonic forces\u2014better fits the text than A\u2019s \u201cfloating jungle pads.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Solid Ground and Beach  \n  \u2022 After the crash, Blane notes a \u201csilvery sand\u201d beach and an undercut \u201cmoss-grown boulder at the water\u2019s edge.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cthe cruiser plowed into the silvery sand. \u2026 against a moss-grown boulder at the water\u2019s edge.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 If these islands were merely buoyant vegetation mats, they couldn\u2019t support large boulders cemented with moss. That implies a stable, rocky substrate\u2014i.e., continental crust.\n\n2. Furrow and Ship Righting  \n  \u2022 Blane observes \u201cthe furrow plowed in the sand\u201d by the cruiser and immediately plans to \u201clift the ship, swing it about, and head her toward the sea.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cLet\u2019s take a look outside \u2026 We seem to have done it \u2026 the furrow plowed in the sand. \u2026 After rewiring \u2026 we\u2019ll \u2026 head her toward the sea.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 On a floating mat, a heavy ship would simply punch through or flex the pad, not leave a neat trench in solid sand.\n\n3. Island Shape and Permanence  \n  \u2022 Blane expects the monster to haunt \u201can island shaped like a turtle.\u201d Such detailed, stable topography points to a rigid landform, not a shifting mat of jungle. Vegetation mats tend to deform, not hold precise shapes like a turtle outline.\n\n4. Vegetation Rooted in Soil  \n  \u2022 The text describes \u201cthe tangled luxuriant growth of the jungle\u201d spread \u201csolid\u201d across the island. <quote> a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n</quote> Plants need soil, not floating waterlogged mats. A continental shelf remnant provides the soil depth necessary for trees hundreds of feet tall.\n\nWhy Debater_A\u2019s \u201cfloating pads\u201d fails:  \n  \u2022 There\u2019s no hint in the story of algal or root mats thick enough to bear that structure.  \n  \u2022 Blane and Wood treat the islands as land when exploring (\u201cclamber through the port,\u201d \u201cstand for a moment \u2026 staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence\u201d). They never encounter any instability or wet, spongy ground typical of floating mats.  \n  \u2022 The moss-covered boulder and sand beach are geologic, not botanical, features.\n\nIn sum, only the tectonic-uplift model explains stable rocky beaches, boulders, furrows from a heavy vessel, and dense jungle rooted in soil. Therefore, the islands of Venus in Peacock\u2019s story must be exposed continental plates risen to the surface by tectonic forces.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s tectonic-plate theory simply can\u2019t withstand a close reading of Peacock\u2019s text\u2014and in every respect the floating-pad model fits perfectly.\n\n1. Textual Proofs of Buoyancy and Drift  \n   \u2022 \u201cFloated free in the phosphorescent ocean\u201d (Ch. II). B argues these are rigid landforms, yet the story repeatedly emphasizes that the islands drift \u201cwith the slow currents of the water planet.\u201d Continental plates don\u2019t bob on currents\u2014floating mats do.  \n   \u2022 Blane and Wood watch \u201cthe tiny smudge of black on the horizon\u201d approach as they swoop in at high speed\u2014again showing these islands are discrete floating bodies, not fixed crust.\n\n2. \u201cSilvery Sand\u201d and Moss-Covered Boulder Do Not Imply Solid Bedrock  \n   \u2022 Floating peat-and-root mats on Earth often pick up sand, gravel\u2014even boulders washed onto them by currents or storms\u2014and later sustain moss growth. Nothing in the text says the boulder is bedrock; it\u2019s merely \u201cmoss-grown\u201d and sitting at the water\u2019s edge. On a buoyant pad, debris can accumulate, cemented by ferns and root tangles into what looks like a miniature rocky outcrop.  \n   \u2022 The neat trench (\u201cthe furrow plowed in the sand\u201d) simply shows that the mat\u2019s upper sand layer was compressed. A thick, semi-rigid pad easily bears a trench under a heavy ship.\n\n3. Jungle Thickness and Island Shape Easily Explained by Vegetation Mats  \n   \u2022 Peacock describes \u201ca solid mass of heavy fern-like growth\u201d springing from a \u201cbeach\u201d\u2014precisely what you\u2019d expect on a floating raft of vegetation, whose interlaced roots support massive ferns. Roots create a soil-like medium. No story detail demands volcanic or continental soil.  \n   \u2022 The turtle outline is stable because floating mats can freeze their shape when root-networks form a dense mat. Currents move them slowly, so they retain \u201cturtle-like\u201d contours.\n\n4. Consistency with the Solar-Power Failure  \n   \u2022 When they crash, \u201csolar rays can\u2019t penetrate the miles of clouds\u201d\u2014so their solar-charged Zelta-guns die. If the islands were rock, exposed above cloud level, they might at least catch some sun and recharge via reflected UV. But the floating pads lie just under the cloud layer, bathing only in diffuse glow\u2014just enough for the worms, not enough for the guns.  \n\n5. Logical Economy and Story Intent  \n   \u2022 Peacock\u2019s repeated emphasis on the ocean as \u201cliquid fluorescence\u201d and the islands as objects \u201cfloating free\u201d insists the world is water-locked. Introducing hidden continental plates contradicts the premise of a true water-world.  \n   \u2022 Only floating pads covered in jungle can satisfy all conditions at once\u2014drift, vegetation, beach sand, and solar-power failure.  \n\nIn short, Debater_B has to invent unseen bedrock and ignore the story\u2019s insistence on floating, drifting islands and vegetation mats that bear sand and boulders. The simplest, text-rooted answer is that Venus\u2019s islands are floating pads covered in jungle.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s \u201cfloating jungle pads\u201d simply cannot withstand scrutiny of the text. The only coherent model is that Venus\u2019s islands are rigid continental fragments uplifted by tectonics. I will first dismantle A\u2019s key points, then reinforce the tectonic-plate interpretation with direct evidence.\n\n1. \u201cFloating\u201d does not mean \u201cbotanical raft\u201d  \n  \u2022 A points to \u201cisland\u2026 floated free in the phosphorescent ocean,\u201d but any island in a sea \u201cfloats\u201d in the sense of being surrounded by water. There is no description of buoyant mats or shifting ground\u2014only of true landmasses.  \n  \u2022 If these were mats of tangled roots and soil, the cruiser\u2019s crash would have punched straight through or flexed the pad. Instead Blane notes \u201cthe furrow plowed in the sand,\u201d a tidy trench in firm substrate. Floating vegetation would not hold silvery sand in place to form a beach.  \n\n2. Stable, permanent topography demands rock, not sponge  \n  \u2022 Blane expects an island \u201cshaped like a turtle\u201d\u2014a precise, enduring outline. Floating rafts of plant debris would warp and deform; they never hold recognizable outlines for centuries. Rigid continental fragments, however, can preserve turtle-shell shapes carved by erosion and coastal currents.  \n  \u2022 The presence of a \u201cmoss-grown boulder at the water\u2019s edge\u201d further proves these islands are rocky. Only lithic masses cemented in place over long periods gather moss. A floating pad of decomposed organic matter could not support an unmoving boulder. <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026the cruiser plowed into the silvery sand\u2026 against a moss-grown boulder at the water\u2019s edge.\u201d</invalid_quote>\n\n3. Deep soils to support towering jungle  \n  \u2022 The story describes \u201ca solid mass of heavy fern-like growth\u201d two hundred feet high. Deep, well-drained soils that derive from weathered rock are required to nourish such giant plants. Floating mats are notoriously shallow and waterlogged.  \n  \u2022 Blane and Wood move confidently across the surface\u2014\u201cthey stood\u2026 staring at the long lazy rollers\u2026 then gazed at the great fern-like trees.\u201d There is no hesitation, no sense of unstable footing or spongy ground.\n\n4. Islands carried by currents? No\u2014fixed by tectonic forces  \n  \u2022 A argues that drifting with currents indicates floating pads. But the text never says the islands drift rapidly. They speak of \u201cslow currents of the water planet\u201d merely to locate them, not to describe agility or drift-rate. Tectonic blocks, once exposed, can move slowly over geological time but appear stationary in human experience.  \n  \u2022 The explorers chart island positions and return repeatedly: \u201cThirty minutes later, Kerry Blane circled the island\u2026it floated free\u2026 he whistled softly\u2026 snapped out of it.\u201d Never does the island change shape or slip away during their survey, as a mat would with wind and waves.\n\nWhy A\u2019s narrative details don\u2019t help floating pads  \n  \u2022 The \u201csilvery sand\u201d on the shore is never described as decayed vegetation; it\u2019s granular, like true sand. Decaying plant fiber makes peat or muck, not sand beaches.  \n  \u2022 Solar-powered Zelta-guns failing reflects the absence of sunlight at cloud-level, not the nature of the substrate. Continental plates would block light just as readily as jungle mats.\n\nIn direct contrast, the tectonic-uplift model explains every feature:  \n  \u2013 The existence of rocky beaches and mossy boulders.  \n  \u2013 The ability of a heavy cruiser to carve a trench in firm ground.  \n  \u2013 The enduring turtle shape of the island.  \n  \u2013 The deep soils needed for towering ferns.  \n\nFloating pads covered in jungle may sound romantic, but they contradict the concrete geological and botanical details Peacock gives us. Only exposed continental plates risen above Venus\u2019s phosphorescent ocean by tectonic action can account for firm sand beaches, moss-covered rock, precise island shapes, and luxuriant, deeply rooted jungle. Therefore, the islands of Venus are solid continental fragments\u2014not drifting vegetation rafts.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
