Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

The claim that Starr\u2019s refrain \u201cHe\u2019s crossed the line\u201d shows moral indignation ignores how that phrase is embedded in prosecutorial purpose.

Instead, he sees impeachment as the performance metric of his office\u2014another sign that he treated this as a job.\n\n4.  The musical\u2019s structure reinforces this.  Starr appears exclusively in his role as Independent Counsel; he never offers a soliloquy about personal conscience or virtue ethics.  Other characters discuss him in strictly professional terms\u2014money spent, tactics used, office politics.  There is no moment where Starr abandons the persona of counsel and reveals some higher moral calling.\n\n5.  Finally, it is part of the Independent Counsel statute that once credible evidence emerged, Starr was obliged to investigate.  That legal mandate underpins every lyric he sings.  It\u2019s not a side-note; it\u2019s the core of his presence in the show.  He sings about subpoenas, grand juries, perjury traps\u2014tools of his trade.  A moral crusader might have refused to use such tricks, but a prosecutor bound by statute and procedure will deploy every available instrument to fulfill his duty.\n\nIn sum, the text paints Kenneth Starr as an officer of the court doing his sworn duty, not a lone knight pursuing moral absolutes.  Debater_B\u2019s \u201cmatter of principle\u201d reading overstates a few resonant phrases and ignores the overwhelming legalistic framing of Starr\u2019s actions.

Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

Kenneth Starr acted because it was his duty as Independent Counsel, not simply out of personal principle.  The musical makes this explicit:\n\n    a.  In \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Starr himself says, But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line. He's  That lyric isn\u2019t about moral indignation alone\u2014it\u2019s about fulfilling the responsibilities of his office.  \n        <quote>But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line. He's</quote>  \n\n    b.  He repeatedly frames his investigation as prosecutorial work.  He complains of \u201cwasted time\u201d on aides, \u201claying a perjury trap,\u201d and insists that \u201chonest men beat the rap\u201d\u2014all hallmarks of a lawyer insisting he\u2019s simply doing his job.\n        <quote>line. It may have seemed like dirty pool To drag his people 'fore the jury. We wasted lots of Vernon's time,</quote>  \n\n2.  The context of an Independent Counsel requires investigation whenever credible evidence of wrongdoing arises.  Starr\u2019s charge was to follow the facts wherever they led\u2014even if that meant examining the President.  This is textbook prosecutorial duty, not extra-legal crusading.\n\n3.  Debater_B\u2019s \u201cmatter of principle\u201d thesis collapses under scrutiny:\n\n    a.  If principle alone motivated Starr, why does he never reference his own ethics or moral convictions?  Instead, he talks about rule-stretching, prosecutorial strategy, and legal definition.  \n    b.  He doesn\u2019t sing about upholding justice in the abstract; he sings about subpoenas, testimony, perjury traps, and \u201ccrossing the line.\u201d  Those are the nuts and bolts of legal process.\n\n4.  Finally, the show\u2019s structure underscores that Starr is the office, not the man:  \n    \u2022  He appears only in service of the Independent Counsel\u2019s role, and other characters reference him in legal terms (\u201cStarr has spent $40 million \u2026 prosecutorial disgrace\u201d).  \n    \u2022  The final number, \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d depicts Starr lamenting wasted public money and no presidential removal\u2014again, concerns of a public prosecutor, not a moral crusader.\n\nConclusion: Everyone in the musical portrays Starr as doing precisely what an Independent Counsel must do\u2014investigate credible allegations of high-level misconduct.  The text never elevates personal principle above his legal mandate.  Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cIt was his job.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening (For \u201cIt was a matter of principle\u201d)\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIt was his job\u201d answer ignores Kenneth Starr\u2019s own words about right and wrong.  In \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Starr repeatedly frames his investigation not as bureaucratic drudgery but as a moral imperative.  As he sings:\n   <quote>line. Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules When the president crosses the line.</quote>\n   He is not saying, \u201cI have to do this because my office demands it.\u201d  He\u2019s saying: \u201cWhen someone\u2014anyone\u2014breaks the rules, you must act.\u201d  That is principled language, not rote duty.\n\n2. The song\u2019s repeated refrain\u2014\u201cHe\u2019s crossed the line\u201d\u2014underscores that Starr views Clinton\u2019s alleged lies as more than a prosecutorial assignment; he sees them as an ethical breach requiring response.  If this were merely \u201chis job,\u201d he would describe routines and procedures.  Instead, he emphasizes personal outrage:\n   <quote>But lying about it gets my blood up And the president's crossed the line.</quote>\n   You feel indignation, not a sense of \u201cwell, that\u2019s what I\u2019m paid to do.\u201d\n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s position also conflicts with Starr\u2019s own defense of his methods.  He admits that tactics were \u201cdirty pool,\u201d but insists he was morally justified:\n   <quote>But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line. He's</quote>\n   A mere job description doesn\u2019t explain why he would knowingly employ aggressive tactics\u2014he did it because he believed the principle at stake (truth under oath) outweighed conventional prosecutorial restraint.\n\n4. Finally, the climax in \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d shows Starr lamenting not that he failed at his job, but that he spent \u201c$40 million\u201d and yet \u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d  He complains not about office politics but about failing to reinforce accountability.  That disappointment betrays a belief that he owed it to the public\u2019s trust in the presidency\u2014not merely to his own performance metrics.\n\nIn short, the text repeatedly portrays Starr as driven by a conviction that truth and the rule of law transcend mere bureaucratic assignment.  The best answer to \u201cWhy did Kenneth say he felt a need to investigate Clinton?\u201d is that \u201cIt was a matter of principle.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was his job\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIt was his job\u201d answer ignores Kenneth Starr\u2019s own words about right and wrong.  In \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Starr repeatedly frames his investigation not as bureaucratic drudgery but as a moral imperative.  As he sings:\n   <quote>line. Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules When the president crosses the line.</quote>\n   He is not saying, \u201cI have to do this because my office demands it.\u201d  He\u2019s saying: \u201cWhen someone\u2014anyone\u2014breaks the rules, you must act.\u201d  That is principled language, not rote duty.\n\n2. The song\u2019s repeated refrain\u2014\u201cHe\u2019s crossed the line\u201d\u2014underscores that Starr views Clinton\u2019s alleged lies as more than a prosecutorial assignment; he sees them as an ethical breach requiring response.  If this were merely \u201chis job,\u201d he would describe routines and procedures.  Instead, he emphasizes personal outrage:\n   <quote>But lying about it gets my blood up And the president's crossed the line.</quote>\n   You feel indignation, not a sense of \u201cwell, that\u2019s what I\u2019m paid to do.\u201d\n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s position also conflicts with Starr\u2019s own defense of his methods.  He admits that tactics were \u201cdirty pool,\u201d but insists he was morally justified:\n   <quote>But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line. He's</quote>\n   A mere job description doesn\u2019t explain why he would knowingly employ aggressive tactics\u2014he did it because he believed the principle at stake (truth under oath) outweighed conventional prosecutorial restraint.\n\n4. Finally, the climax in \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d shows Starr lamenting not that he failed at his job, but that he spent \u201c$40 million\u201d and yet \u201cthe only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d  He complains not about office politics but about failing to reinforce accountability.  That disappointment betrays a belief that he owed it to the public\u2019s trust in the presidency\u2014not merely to his own performance metrics.\n\nIn short, the text repeatedly portrays Starr as driven by a conviction that truth and the rule of law transcend mere bureaucratic assignment.  The best answer to \u201cWhy did Kenneth say he felt a need to investigate Clinton?\u201d is that \u201cIt was a matter of principle.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Opening Statement:\n\n1.  Kenneth Starr acted because it was his duty as Independent Counsel, not simply out of personal principle.  The musical makes this explicit:\n\n    a.  In \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Starr himself says, But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line. He's  That lyric isn\u2019t about moral indignation alone\u2014it\u2019s about fulfilling the responsibilities of his office.  \n        <quote>But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line.

He complains of \u201cwasted time\u201d on aides, \u201claying a perjury trap,\u201d and insists that \u201chonest men beat the rap\u201d\u2014all hallmarks of a lawyer insisting he\u2019s simply doing his job.\n        <quote>line. It may have seemed like dirty pool To drag his people 'fore the jury. We wasted lots of Vernon's time,</quote>  \n\n2.  The context of an Independent Counsel requires investigation whenever credible evidence of wrongdoing arises.  Starr\u2019s charge was to follow the facts wherever they led\u2014even if that meant examining the President.  This is textbook prosecutorial duty, not extra-legal crusading.\n\n3.  Debater_B\u2019s \u201cmatter of principle\u201d thesis collapses under scrutiny:\n\n    a.  If principle alone motivated Starr, why does he never reference his own ethics or moral convictions?  Instead, he talks about rule-stretching, prosecutorial strategy, and legal definition.  \n    b.  He doesn\u2019t sing about upholding justice in the abstract; he sings about subpoenas, testimony, perjury traps, and \u201ccrossing the line.\u201d  Those are the nuts and bolts of legal process.\n\n4.  Finally, the show\u2019s structure underscores that Starr is the office, not the man:  \n    \u2022  He appears only in service of the Independent Counsel\u2019s role, and other characters reference him in legal terms (\u201cStarr has spent $40 million \u2026 prosecutorial disgrace\u201d).  \n    \u2022  The final number, \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d depicts Starr lamenting wasted public money and no presidential removal\u2014again, concerns of a public prosecutor, not a moral crusader.\n\nConclusion: Everyone in the musical portrays Starr as doing precisely what an Independent Counsel must do\u2014investigate credible allegations of high-level misconduct.  The text never elevates personal principle above his legal mandate.  Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cIt was his job.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was a matter of principle\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

That disappointment betrays a belief that he owed it to the public\u2019s trust in the presidency\u2014not merely to his own performance metrics.\n\nIn short, the text repeatedly portrays Starr as driven by a conviction that truth and the rule of law transcend mere bureaucratic assignment.  The best answer to \u201cWhy did Kenneth say he felt a need to investigate Clinton?\u201d is that \u201cIt was a matter of principle.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s argument hinges on reading Starr\u2019s lyrics as moralizing rhetoric, but a close look at the text shows Starr is speaking at every turn from the standpoint of his legal mandate\u2014not from some personal code of honor.  \n\n1.  Starr constantly frames his work in prosecutorial\u2014and only prosecutorial\u2014terms.  In \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d he complains about \u201cwasted time,\u201d \u201cdirty pool,\u201d perjury traps, and \u201cstretch[ing] the rules.\u201d  That vocabulary belongs to a lawyer doing tactical cost-benefit analyses, not a moral crusader:\n    <quote>It may have seemed like dirty pool To drag his people 'fore the jury. We wasted lots of Vernon's time,</quote>  \n    <quote>I'd be a nitwit not to bend a bit When the president crosses the line.</quote>  \n    If principle alone motivated him, he would speak of right and wrong in sweeping terms.  Instead, he speaks of jury tactics and rule-bending\u2014plain signs that his driving concern is fulfilling the duties of his office as Independent Counsel.\n\n2.  The claim that Starr\u2019s refrain \u201cHe\u2019s crossed the line\u201d shows moral indignation ignores how that phrase is embedded in prosecutorial purpose.  Starr doesn\u2019t rail against betrayal or corruption in the abstract; he uses it as the trigger for legal action.  He literally declares:  \n    <quote>But lying about it gets my blood up And the president's crossed the line.</quote>  \n    That anger is professional indignation at perjury, not an expression of personal moral anguish.  It\u2019s akin to a detective saying, \u201cI get fired up when someone steals\u201d\u2014the heat comes from doing one\u2019s job effectively.\n\n3.  Debater_B points to Starr\u2019s lament in \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d over spending \u201c$40 million\u201d and getting no presidential removal.  But notice what he mourns: not the collapse of a moral standard or betrayal of country, but the failure of his prosecutorial effort:\n    <invalid_quote>I spent four years and 40 million \u2026 The only scalp I got was Newt's.</invalid_quote>  \n    If Starr were driven by principle first, he would have celebrated having exposed wrongdoing, whether or not it led to impeachment.  Instead, he sees impeachment as the performance metric of his office\u2014another sign that he treated this as a job.\n\n4.  The musical\u2019s structure reinforces this.  Starr appears exclusively in his role as Independent Counsel; he never offers a soliloquy about personal conscience or virtue ethics.  Other characters discuss him in strictly professional terms\u2014money spent, tactics used, office politics.  There is no moment where Starr abandons the persona of counsel and reveals some higher moral calling.\n\n5.  Finally, it is part of the Independent Counsel statute that once credible evidence emerged, Starr was obliged to investigate.  That legal mandate underpins every lyric he sings.  It\u2019s not a side-note; it\u2019s the core of his presence in the show.  He sings about subpoenas, grand juries, perjury traps\u2014tools of his trade.  A moral crusader might have refused to use such tricks, but a prosecutor bound by statute and procedure will deploy every available instrument to fulfill his duty.\n\nIn sum, the text paints Kenneth Starr as an officer of the court doing his sworn duty, not a lone knight pursuing moral absolutes.  Debater_B\u2019s \u201cmatter of principle\u201d reading overstates a few resonant phrases and ignores the overwhelming legalistic framing of Starr\u2019s actions.  Therefore, the correct answer remains: he said he felt a need to investigate Clinton because it was his job.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A misreads Starr\u2019s words as mere \u201cduty.\u201d  In \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Starr doesn\u2019t merely say \u201cI have an office to run\u201d\u2014he frames the whole endeavor as responding to a moral violation.  He insists:  \n   <quote>Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules When the president crosses the line.</quote>  \n   That is emphatically not the language of a bureaucrat who \u201chas to do this because it\u2019s my job.\u201d  It\u2019s the language of a man outraged by an ethical breach.\n\n2. Starr\u2019s repeated invocation of \u201ccrossing the line\u201d makes plain that he sees Clinton\u2019s alleged lies as a fundamental affront to the rule of law, not just a prosecutorial checklist.  He sings:  \n   <quote>But lying about it gets my blood up And the president's crossed the line.</quote>  \n   If he were simply fulfilling a mandate, he would emphasize procedure (\u201csubpoenas,\u201d \u201ctestimony,\u201d \u201cperjury traps\u201d), but instead he highlights personal indignation and principle.\n\n3. Debater_A argues Starr \u201cnever references his own ethics.\u201d  That is false.  Throughout \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Starr repeatedly justifies his aggressive methods by insisting on accountability whenever anyone\u2014even the President\u2014violates a core principle.  He declares:  \n   <invalid_quote>When the president crosses the line [\u2026] A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.</invalid_quote>  \n   He\u2019s not talking about job satisfaction; he\u2019s invoking an unbreakable moral rule: wrongdoing demands redress.\n\n4. Finally, in \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d Starr laments not \u201cfailing my duty\u201d but \u201c$40 million wasted\u201d and \u201cthe people\u201d allowing Clinton to stay despite this moral breach:  \n   <quote>I made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt's.</quote>  \n   His frustration is that truth and justice were not vindicated\u2014not that he failed to perform paperwork.  That is the language of principle, not job performance.\n\nDebater_A\u2019s \u201cjust a job\u201d thesis collapses because it cannot account for the intense, value-laden rhetoric Starr uses.  Every time he sings, he frames the inquiry as a moral imperative\u2014truth versus deceit\u2014not a routine assignment.  Thus, Kenneth Starr said he \u201cfelt a need\u201d to investigate Clinton precisely because it was a matter of principle.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
