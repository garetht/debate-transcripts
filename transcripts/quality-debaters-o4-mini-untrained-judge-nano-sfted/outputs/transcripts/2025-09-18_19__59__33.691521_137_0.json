    "background_text": "Conspiracy on Callisto By JAMES MacCREIGH Revolt was flaring on Callisto, and Peter Duane\n\n held the secret that would make the uprising a\n\n success or failure. Yet he could make no move,\n\n could favor no side\u2014his memory was gone\u2014he\n\n didn't know for whom he fought.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Duane's hand flicked to his waist and hung there, poised. His dis-gun  remained undrawn.\n\n\n The tall, white-haired man\u2014Stevens\u2014smiled.\n\n\n \"You're right, Duane,\" he said. \"I could blast you, too. Nobody would  win that way, so let's leave the guns where they are.\"\n\n\n The muscles twitched in Peter Duane's cheeks, but his voice, when it  came, was controlled. \"Don't think we're going to let this go,\" he  said. \"We'll take it up with Andrias tonight. We'll see whether you can  cut me out!\"\n\n\n The white-haired man's smile faded. He stepped forward, one hand  bracing him against the thrust of the rocket engines underneath,  holding to the guide rail at the side of the ship's corridor.\n\n\n He said, \"Duane, Andrias is your boss, not mine. I'm a free lance; I  work for myself. When we land on Callisto tonight I'll be with you when  you turn our\u2014shall I say, our cargo ?\u2014over to him. And I'll collect  my fair share of the proceeds. That's as far as it goes. I take no  orders from him.\"\n\n\n A heavy-set man in blue appeared at the end of the connecting corridor.  He was moving fast, but stopped short when he saw the two men.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he said. \"Change of course\u2014get to your cabins.\" He seemed about  to walk up to them, then reconsidered and hurried off. Neither man paid  any attention.\n\n\n Duane said, \"Do I have to kill you?\" It was only a question as he asked  it, without threatening.\n\n\n A muted alarm bell sounded through the P.A. speakers, signaling a  one-minute warning. The white-haired man cocked his eyebrow.\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" he said. He took the measure of his slim, red-headed  opponent. Taller, heavier, older, he was still no more uncompromisingly  belligerent than Duane, standing there. \"Not at all,\" he repeated.  \"Just take your ten thousand and let it go at that. Don't make trouble.  Leave Andrias out of our private argument.\"\n\n\n \"Damn you!\" Duane flared. \"I was promised fifty thousand. I need that  money. Do you think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget what I think,\" Stevens said, his voice clipped and angry. \"I  don't care about fairness, Duane, except to myself. I've done all the  work on this\u2014I've supplied the goods. My price is set, a hundred  thousand Earth dollars. What Andrias promised you is no concern of  mine. The fact is that, after I've taken my share, there's only ten  thousand left. That's all you get!\"\n\n\n Duane stared at him a long second, then nodded abruptly. \"I was right  the first time,\" he said. \"I'll have to kill you!\" Already his hand was streaking toward the grip of his dis-gun, touching  it, drawing it forth. But the white-haired man was faster. His arms  swept up and pinioned Duane, holding him impotent.\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool,\" he grated. \"Duane\u2014\"\n\n\n The P.A. speaker rattled, blared something unintelligible. Neither man  heard it. Duane lunged forward into the taller man's grip, sliding down  to the floor. The white-haired man grappled furiously to keep his hold  on Peter's gun arm, but Peter was slipping away. Belatedly, Stevens  went for his own gun.\n\n\n He was too late. Duane's was out and leveled at him.\n\n\n \" Now will you listen to reason?\" Duane panted. But he halted, and the  muzzle of his weapon wavered. The floor swooped and surged beneath him  as the thrust of the mighty jets was cut off. Suddenly there was no  gravity. The two men, locked together, floated weightlessly out to the  center of the corridor.\n\n\n \"Course change!\" gasped white-haired Stevens. \"Good God!\"\n\n\n The ship had reached the midpoint of its flight. The bells had sounded,  warning every soul on it to take shelter, to strap themselves in their  pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship  reversed itself and began to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto.  But the two men had not heeded.\n\n\n The small steering rockets flashed briefly. The men were thrust  bruisingly against the side of the corridor as the rocket spun lazily  on its axis. The side jets flared once more to halt the spin, when the  one-eighty turn was completed, and the men were battered against the  opposite wall, still weightless, still clinging to each other, still  struggling.\n\n\n Then the main-drive bellowed into life again, and the ship began to  battle against its own built-up acceleration. The corridor floor rose  up with blinking speed to smite them\u2014\n\n\n And the lights went out in a burst of crashing pain for Peter Duane. Someone was talking to him. Duane tried to force an eye open to see who  it was, and failed. Something damp and clinging was all about his face,  obscuring his vision. But the voice filtered in.\n\n\n \"Open your mouth,\" it said. \"Please, Peter, open your mouth. You're all  right. Just swallow this.\"\n\n\n It was a girl's voice. Duane was suddenly conscious that a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. He shook his head feebly.\n\n\n The voice became more insistent. \"Swallow this,\" it said. \"It's only a  stimulant, to help you throw off the shock of your\u2014accident. You're  all right, otherwise.\"\n\n\n Obediently he opened his mouth, and choked on a warm, tingly liquid.  He managed to swallow it, and lay quiet as deft feminine hands did  something to his face. Suddenly light filtered through his closed  eyelids, and cool air stirred against his damp face.\n\n\n He opened his eyes. A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. She stepped back a pace, a web of wet gauze bandage  in her hands, looking at him.\n\n\n \"Hello,\" he whispered. \"You\u2014where am I?\"\n\n\n \"In the sick bay,\" she said. \"You got caught out when the ship changed  course. Lucky you weren't hurt, Peter. The man you were with\u2014the old,  white-haired one, Stevens\u2014wasn't so lucky. He was underneath when the  jets went on. Three ribs broken\u2014his lung was punctured. He died in the  other room an hour ago.\"\n\n\n Duane screwed his eyes tight together and grimaced. When he opened  them again there was alertness and clarity in them\u2014but there was also  bafflement.\n\n\n \"Girl,\" he said, \"who are you? Where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Peter!\" There was shock and hurt in the tone of her voice. \"I'm\u2014don't  you know me, Peter?\"\n\n\n Duane shook his head confusedly. \"I don't know anything,\" he said.  \"I\u2014I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\n \"Duane, Duane,\" a man's heavy voice said. \"That won't wash. Don't play  dumb on me.\"\n\n\n \"Duane?\" he said. \"Duane....\" He swiveled his head and saw a dark,  squat man frowning at him. \"Who are you?\" Peter asked.\n\n\n The dark man laughed. \"Take your time, Duane,\" he said easily. \"You'll  remember me. My name's Andrias. I've been waiting here for you to wake  up. We have some business matters to discuss.\"\n\n\n The nurse, still eyeing Duane with an odd bewilderment, said: \"I'll  leave you alone for a moment. Don't talk too much to him, Mr. Andrias.  He's still suffering from shock.\"\n\n\n \"I won't,\" Andrias promised, grinning. Then, as the girl left the room,  the smile dropped from his face.\n\n\n \"You play rough, Duane,\" he observed. \"I thought you'd have trouble  with Stevens. I didn't think you'd find it necessary to put him out of  the way so permanently. Well, no matter. If you had to kill him, it's  no skin off my nose. Give me a release on the merchandise. I've got  your money here.\" Duane waved a hand and pushed himself dizzily erect, swinging his legs  over the side of the high cot. A sheet had been thrown over him, but he  was fully dressed. He examined his clothing with interest\u2014gray tunic,  gray leather spaceman's boots. It was unfamiliar.\n\n\n He shook his head in further confusion, and the motion burst within his  skull, throbbing hotly. He closed his eyes until it subsided, trying to  force his brain to operate, to explain to him where and what he was.\n\n\n He looked at the man named Andrias.\n\n\n \"Nobody seems to believe me,\" he said, \"but I really don't know what's  going on. Things are moving too fast for me. Really, I\u2014why, I don't  even know my own name! My head\u2014it hurts. I can't think clearly.\"\n\n\n Andrias straightened, turned a darkly-suspicious look on Duane. \"Don't  play tricks on me,\" he said savagely. \"I haven't time for them. I won't  mince words with you. Give me a release on the cargo now, before I have  to get rough. This is a lot more important to me than your life is.\"\n\n\n \"Go to hell,\" Duane said shortly. \"I'm playing no tricks.\"\n\n\n There was an instant's doubt in Andrias' eyes, then it flashed away. He  bent closer, peered at Duane. \"I almost think\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You're lying all right. You  killed Stevens to get his share\u2014and now you're trying to hold me up.  That's your last chance that just went by, Duane. From now on, I'm  running this show!\"\n\n\n He spun around and strode to the door, thrust it open. \"Dakin!\" he  bellowed. \"Reed!\"\n\n\n Two large, ugly men in field-gray uniforms, emblazoned with the  shooting-star insignia of Callisto's League police, came in, looking to  Andrias for instructions.\n\n\n \"Duane here is resisting arrest,\" Andrias said. \"Take him along. We'll  fix up the charges later.\"\n\n\n \"You can't do that,\" Duane said wearily. \"I'm sick. If you've got  something against me, save it. Wait till my head clears. I'm sure I can  explain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Explain, hell.\" The dark man laughed. \"If I wait, this ship will be  blasting off for Ganymede within two hours. I'll wait\u2014but so will the  ship. It's not going anywhere till I give it clearance. I run Callisto;  I'll give the orders here!\" II\n\n\n Whoever this man Andrias was, thought Duane, he was certainly a man of  importance on Callisto. As he had said, he gave the orders.\n\n\n The crew of the rocket made no objection when Andrias and his men took  Duane off without a word. Duane had thought the nurse, who seemed a  good enough sort, might have said something on his behalf. But she was  out of sight as they left. A curt sentence to a gray-clad official on  the blast field where the rocket lay, and the man nodded and hurried  off, to tell the rocket's captain that the ship was being refused  clearance indefinitely.\n\n\n A long, powerful ground car slid up before them. Andrias got in front,  while the two uniformed men shoved Duane into the back of the car,  climbed in beside him. Andrias gave a curt order, and the car shot  forward.\n\n\n The driver, sitting beside Andrias, leaned forward and readied a hand  under the dashboard. The high wail of a siren came instantly from the  car's roof, and what traffic was on the broad, straight highway into  which they had turned pulled aside to let them race through.\n\n\n Ahead lay the tall spires of a city. Graceful, hundreds of feet high,  they seemed dreamlike yet somehow oddly familiar to Duane. Somewhere  he had seen them before. He dragged deep into his mind, plumbing the  cloudy, impenetrable haze that had settled on it, trying to bring forth  the memories that he should have had. Amnesia, they called it; complete  forgetting of the happenings of a lifetime. He'd heard of it\u2014but never  dreamed it could happen to him! My name, it seems, is Peter Duane , he thought. And they tell me that  I killed a man! The thought was starkly incredible to him. A white-haired man, it had  been; someone named Stevens. He tried to remember.\n\n\n Yes, there had been a white-haired man. And there had been an argument.  Something to do with money, with a shipment of goods that Stevens had  supplied to Duane. There has even been talk of killing....\n\n\n But\u2014murder! Duane looked at his hands helplessly.\n\n\n Andrias, up ahead, was turning around. He looked sharply at Duane, for  a long second. An uncertainty clouded his eyes, and abruptly he looked  forward again without speaking.\n\n\n \"Who's this man Andrias?\" Duane whispered to the nearest guard.\n\n\n The man stared at him. \"Governor Andrias,\" he said, \"is the League's  deputy on Callisto. You know\u2014the Earth-Mars League. They put Governor  Andrias here to\u2014well, to govern for them.\"\n\n\n \"League?\" Duane asked, wrinkling his brow. He had heard something about  a League once, yes. But it was all so nebulous....\n\n\n The other guard stirred, leaned over. \"Shut up,\" he said heavily.  \"You'll have plenty of chance for talking later.\" But the chance was a long time in coming. Duane found himself, an hour  later, still in the barred room into which he'd been thrust. The guards  had brought him there, at Andrias' order, and left him. That had been  all.\n\n\n This was not a regular jail, Duane realized. It was more like a  palace, something out of Earth's Roman-empire days, all white stone  and frescoed walls. Duane wished for human companionship\u2014particularly  that of the nurse. Of all the people he'd met since awakening in that  hospital bed, only she seemed warm and human. The others were\u2014brutal,  deadly. It was too bad, Duane reflected, that he'd failed to remember  her. She'd seemed hurt, and she had certainly known him by first name.  But perhaps she would understand.\n\n\n Duane sat down on a lumpy, sagging bed and buried his head in his  hands. Dim ghosts of memory were wandering in his mind. He tried to  conjure them into stronger relief, or to exorcise them entirely.\n\n\n Somewhere, some time, a man had said to him, \" Andrias is secretly  arming the Callistan cutthroats for revolt against the League. He wants  personal power\u2014he's prepared to pay any price for it. He needs guns,  Earth guns smuggled in through the League patrol. If he can wipe out  the League police garrison\u2014those who are loyal to the League, still,  instead of to Andrias\u2014he can sit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and  Mars can send. Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless.  And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.  That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. \"\n\n\n Duane could remember the scene clearly. Could almost see the sharp,  aquiline face of the man who had spoken to him. But there memory  stopped.\n\n\n A fugitive recollection raced through his mind. He halted it, dragged  it back, pinned it down....\n\n\n They had stopped in Darkside, the spaceport on the side of Luna that  keeps perpetually averted from Earth, as if the moon knows shame and  wants to hide the rough and roaring dome city that nestles in one  of the great craters. Duane remembered sitting in a low-ceilinged,  smoke-heavy room, across the table from a tall man with white hair.  Stevens!\n\n\n \" Four thousand electron rifles ,\" the man had said. \" Latest  government issue. Never mind how I got them; they're perfect. You know  my price. Take it or leave it. And it's payable the minute we touch  ground on Callisto. \"\n\n\n There had been a few minutes of haggling over terms, then a handshake  and a drink from a thin-necked flagon of pale-yellow liquid fire.\n\n\n He and the white-haired man had gone out then, made their way by  unfrequented side streets to a great windowless building. Duane  remembered the white-hot stars overhead, shining piercingly through  the great transparent dome that kept the air in the sealed city of  Darkside, as they stood at the entrance of the warehouse and spoke in  low tones to the man who answered their summons.\n\n\n Then, inside. And they were looking at a huge chamber full of stacked  fiber boxes\u2014containing nothing but dehydrated dairy products and  mining tools, by the stencils they bore. Duane had turned to the  white-haired man with a puzzled question\u2014and the man had laughed aloud.\n\n\n He dragged one of the boxes down, ripped it open with the sharp point  of a handling hook. Short-barreled, flare-mouthed guns rolled out,  tumbling over the floor. Eight of them were in that one box, and  hundreds of boxes all about. Duane picked one up, broke it, peered into  the chamber where the tiny capsule of U-235 would explode with infinite  violence when the trigger was pulled, spraying radiant death three  thousand yards in the direction the gun was aimed....\n\n\n And that memory ended.\n\n\n Duane got up, stared at his haggard face in the cracked mirror over  the bed. \" They say I'm a killer ,\" he thought. \" Apparently I'm a  gun-runner as well. Good lord\u2014what am I not? \"\n\n\n His reflection\u2014white, drawn face made all the more pallid by the red  hair that blazed over it\u2014stared back at him. There was no answer  there. If only he could remember\u2014\n\n\n \"All right, Duane.\" The deep voice of a guard came to him as the door  swung open. \"Stop making eyes at yourself.\"\n\n\n Duane looked around. The guard beckoned. \"Governor Andrias wants to  speak to you\u2014now. Let's not keep the governor waiting.\" A long, narrow room, with a long carpet leading from the entrance up to  a great heavy desk\u2014that was Andrias' office. Duane felt a click in his  memory as he entered. One of the ancient Earth dictators had employed  just such a psychological trick to overawe those who came to beg favors  of him. Muslini, or some such name.\n\n\n The trick failed to work. Duane had other things on his mind; he walked  the thirty-foot length of the room, designed to imbue him with a sense  of his own unimportance, as steadily as he'd ever walked in the open  air of his home planet.\n\n\n Whichever planet that was.\n\n\n The guard had remained just inside the door, at attention. Andrias  waved him out.\n\n\n \"Here I am,\" said Duane. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Andrias said, \"I've had the ship inspected and what I want is on it.  That saves your life, for now. But the cargo is in your name. I could  take it by force, if I had to. I prefer not to.\" He picked up a paper,  handed it to Duane. \"In spite of your behavior, you can keep alive.  You can even collect the money for the guns\u2014Stevens' share as well  as your own. This is a release form, authorizing my men to take four  hundred and twenty cases of dehydrated foods and drilling supplies from  the hold of the Cameroon \u2014the ship you came on. Sign it, and we'll  forget our argument. Only, sign it now and get it over with. I'm losing  patience, Duane.\"\n\n\n Duane said, without expression, \"No.\"\n\n\n Dark red flooded into Andrias' sallow face. His jaws bunched angrily  and there was a ragged thread of incomplete control to his voice as he  spoke.\n\n\n \"I'll have your neck for this, Duane,\" he said softly.\n\n\n Duane looked at the man's eyes. Death was behind them, peeping out.  Mentally he shrugged. What difference did it make?\n\n\n \"Give me the pen,\" he said shortly.\n\n\n Andrias exhaled a deep breath. You could see the tension leave him, the  mottled anger fade from his face and leave it without expression. He  handed the paper to Duane without a word. He gave him a pen, watched  him scrawl his name.\n\n\n \"That,\" he said, \"is better.\" He paused a moment ruminatively. \"It  would have been better still if you'd not stalled me so long. I find  that hard to forgive in my associates.\"\n\n\n \"The money,\" Peter said. If he were playing a part\u2014pretending he knew  what he was doing\u2014he might as well play it to the hilt. \"When do I get  it?\"\n\n\n Andrias picked up the paper and looked carefully at the signature. He  creased it thoughtfully, stowed it in a pocket before answering.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" he said, \"there will have to be a revision of terms. I  offered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars. I would have paid  it\u2014but you made me angry. You'll have to pay for that.\" Duane said, \"I've paid already. I've been dragged from pillar to post  by you. That's enough. Pay me what you owe me, if you want any more of  the same goods!\"\n\n\n That was a shot in the dark\u2014and it missed the mark.\n\n\n Andrias' eyes widened. \"You amaze me, Duane,\" he said. He rose and  stepped around the desk, confronting Duane. \"I almost think you really  have lost your memory, Duane,\" he said. \"Otherwise, surely you would  know that this is all the rifles I need. With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"\n\n\n Duane said, \"You're ready, then....\"\n\n\n He took time to think it over, but he knew that no thought was  required. Already the hands that he had locked behind him were  clenched, taut. Already the muscles of his legs were tensing.\n\n\n \"You're ready,\" he repeated. \"You've armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the  worst gutter scum on nine planets. You're set to betray the League that  gave you power here.... Well, that changes things. I can't let you do  it!\"\n\n\n He hurled himself at Andrias, hands sweeping around to grapple for the  dark man's throat. Andrias, off-balance, staggered backward. But his  own hands were diving for the twin heat guns that hung at his waist.\n\n\n Duane saw his danger, and reacted. His foot twisted around Andrias'  ankle; his hands at the other's throat gripped tighter. He lunged  forward, slamming the hard top of his head into the other's face,  feeling flesh and cartilage give as Andrias' nose mashed flat. His own  head pin-wheeled dizzily, agonizingly, as the jar revived the pain of  his earlier accident.\n\n\n But Andrias, unconscious already, tumbled back with Duane on top of  him. His head made an audible, spine-chilling thud as it hit the  carpeted floor.\n\n\n Duane got up, retrieving the two heat guns, and stared at him.\n\n\n \" They tell me I killed Stevens the same way ,\" he thought. \" I'm  getting in a rut! \"\n\n\n But Andrias was not dead, though he was out as cold as the void beyond  Pluto. The thick carpeting had saved him from a broken head.\n\n\n Duane stepped over the unconscious man and looked around the room. It  was furnished severely, to the point of barrenness. Two chairs before  Andrias' ornate, bare-topped desk and one luxurious chair behind it;  a tasseled bell cord within easy reach of Andrias' chair; the long  carpet. That was all it contained.\n\n\n The problem of getting out was serious, he saw. How could one\u2014 III\n\n\n Methodically he ransacked the drawers of Andrias' desk. Papers, a  whole arsenal of hand guns, Callistan money by the bale, ominously  black-covered notebooks with cryptic figures littering their  pages\u2014those were the contents. A coldly impersonal desk, without the  familiar trivia most men accumulate. There was nothing, certainly, that  would get him out of a building that so closely resembled a fortress.\n\n\n He tumbled the things back into the drawers helter-skelter, turned  Andrias over and searched his pockets. More money\u2014the man must have  had a fortune within reach at all times\u2014and a few meaningless papers.  Duane took the release he had signed and tore it to shreds. But that  was only a gesture. When Andrias came to, unless Duane had managed to  get away and accomplish something, the mere lack of written permission  would not keep him from the rocket's lethal cargo!\n\n\n When Andrias came to....\n\n\n An idea bloomed in Duane's brain. He looked, then, at unconscious  Andrias\u2014and the idea withered again.\n\n\n He had thought of forcing Andrias himself to front for him, at gun's  point, in the conventional manner of escaping prisoners. But fist  fights, fiction to the contrary notwithstanding, leave marks on the men  who lose them. Andrias' throat was speckled with the livid marks of  Duane's fingers; Duane's head, butting Andrias in the face, had drawn a  thick stream of crimson from his nostrils, turned his sharp nose askew.\n\n\n No guard of Andrias' would have been deceived for an instant, looking  at that face\u2014even assuming that Andrias could have been forced to  cooperate by the threat of a gun. Which, considering the stake Andrias  had in this play, was doubtful....\n\n\n He stood up and looked around. He had to act quickly. Already Andrias'  breath was audible; he saw the man grimace and an arm flopped  spasmodically on the floor. Consciousness was on its way back.\n\n\n Duane touched the heat gun he'd thrust into his belt; drew it and held  it poised, while he sought to discover what was in his own mind. He'd  killed a man already, they said. Was he then a killer\u2014could he shoot  Andrias now, in cold blood, with so much to gain and nothing to lose?\n\n\n He stood there a moment. Then, abruptly, he reversed the weapon and  chopped it down on Andrias' skull.\n\n\n There was a sharp grunt from the still unconscious man, but no other  sign. Only\u2014the first tremors of movement that had shown on him halted,  and did not reappear.\n\n\n \" No ,\" Duane thought. \" Whatever they say, I'm not a killer! \"\n\n\n But still he had to get out. How?\n\n\n Once more he stared around the room, catalogued its contents. The guard  would be getting impatient. Perhaps any minute he would tap the door,  first timorously, then with heavier strokes.\n\n\n The guard! There was a way! Duane eyed the length of the room. Thirty feet\u2014it would take him a  couple of seconds to run it at full speed. Was that fast enough?\n\n\n There was only one way to find out.\n\n\n He walked around the desk to the bell cord. He took a deep breath,  tugged it savagely, and at once was in speedy motion, racing toward the  door, his footsteps muffled in the deep, springy carpet. Almost as he  reached it, he saw it begin to open. He quickly sidestepped and was out  of the guard's sight, behind the door, as the man looked in.\n\n\n Quick suspicion flared in his eyes, then certainty as he saw Andrias  huddled on the floor. He opened his mouth to cry out\u2014\n\n\n But Duane's arm was around his throat, and he had no breath to spare.  Duane's foot lashed out and the door slammed shut; Duane's balled left  fist came up and connected with the guard's chin. Abruptly the man  slumped.\n\n\n Duane took a deep breath and let the man drop to the floor. But he  paused only a second; now he had two unconscious men on his hands and  he dared let neither revive until he was prepared.\n\n\n He grasped the guard's arm and dragged him roughly the length of the  room. He leaped on top of the desk, brutally scarring its gleaming top  with the hard spikes of his boots. His agile fingers unfastened the  long bell cord without causing it to ring and, bearing it, he dropped  again to the floor.\n\n\n Tugging and straining, he got the limp form of Andrias into his own  chair, bound him with the bell cord, gagged him with the priceless  Venus-wool scarf Andrias wore knotted about his throat. He tested his  bindings with full strength, and smiled. Those would hold, let Andrias  struggle as he would.\n\n\n The guard he stripped of clothing, bound and gagged with his own  belt and spaceman's kerchief. He dragged him around behind the desk,  thrust him under it out of sight. Andrias' chair he turned so that the  unconscious face was averted from the door. Should anyone look in,  then, the fact of Andrias' unconsciousness might not be noticed.\n\n\n Then he took off his own clothes, quickly assumed the field-gray  uniform of the guard. It fit like the skin of a fruit. He felt himself  bulging out of it in a dozen places. The long cape the guard wore would  conceal that, perhaps. In any case, there was nothing better.\n\n\n Trying to make his stride as martial as possible, he walked down the  long carpet to the door, opened it and stepped outside. ",

Yet he could make no move,\n\n could favor no side\u2014his memory was gone\u2014he\n\n didn't know for whom he fought.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Duane's hand flicked to his waist and hung there, poised. His dis-gun  remained undrawn.\n\n\n The tall, white-haired man\u2014Stevens\u2014smiled.\n\n\n \"You're right, Duane,\" he said. \"I could blast you, too. Nobody would  win that way, so let's leave the guns where they are.\"\n\n\n The muscles twitched in Peter Duane's cheeks, but his voice, when it  came, was controlled. \"Don't think we're going to let this go,\" he  said. \"We'll take it up with Andrias tonight. We'll see whether you can  cut me out!\"\n\n\n The white-haired man's smile faded. He stepped forward, one hand  bracing him against the thrust of the rocket engines underneath,  holding to the guide rail at the side of the ship's corridor.\n\n\n He said, \"Duane, Andrias is your boss, not mine. I'm a free lance; I  work for myself. When we land on Callisto tonight I'll be with you when  you turn our\u2014shall I say, our cargo ?\u2014over to him. And I'll collect  my fair share of the proceeds. That's as far as it goes. I take no  orders from him.\"\n\n\n A heavy-set man in blue appeared at the end of the connecting corridor.  He was moving fast, but stopped short when he saw the two men.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he said. \"Change of course\u2014get to your cabins.\" He seemed about  to walk up to them, then reconsidered and hurried off. Neither man paid  any attention.\n\n\n Duane said, \"Do I have to kill you?\" It was only a question as he asked  it, without threatening.\n\n\n A muted alarm bell sounded through the P.A. speakers, signaling a  one-minute warning. The white-haired man cocked his eyebrow.\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" he said. He took the measure of his slim, red-headed  opponent. Taller, heavier, older, he was still no more uncompromisingly  belligerent than Duane, standing there. \"Not at all,\" he repeated.  \"Just take your ten thousand and let it go at that. Don't make trouble.  Leave Andrias out of our private argument.\"\n\n\n \"Damn you!\" Duane flared. \"I was promised fifty thousand. I need that  money. Do you think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget what I think,\" Stevens said, his voice clipped and angry. \"I  don't care about fairness, Duane, except to myself. I've done all the  work on this\u2014I've supplied the goods. My price is set, a hundred  thousand Earth dollars. What Andrias promised you is no concern of  mine. The fact is that, after I've taken my share, there's only ten  thousand left. That's all you get!\"\n\n\n Duane stared at him a long second, then nodded abruptly. \"I was right  the first time,\" he said. \"I'll have to kill you!\" Already his hand was streaking toward the grip of his dis-gun, touching  it, drawing it forth. But the white-haired man was faster. His arms  swept up and pinioned Duane, holding him impotent.\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool,\" he grated. \"Duane\u2014\"\n\n\n The P.A. speaker rattled, blared something unintelligible. Neither man  heard it. Duane lunged forward into the taller man's grip, sliding down  to the floor. The white-haired man grappled furiously to keep his hold  on Peter's gun arm, but Peter was slipping away. Belatedly, Stevens  went for his own gun.\n\n\n He was too late. Duane's was out and leveled at him.\n\n\n \" Now will you listen to reason?\" Duane panted. But he halted, and the  muzzle of his weapon wavered. The floor swooped and surged beneath him  as the thrust of the mighty jets was cut off. Suddenly there was no  gravity. The two men, locked together, floated weightlessly out to the  center of the corridor.\n\n\n \"Course change!\" gasped white-haired Stevens. \"Good God!\"\n\n\n The ship had reached the midpoint of its flight. The bells had sounded,  warning every soul on it to take shelter, to strap themselves in their  pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship  reversed itself and began to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto.  But the two men had not heeded.\n\n\n The small steering rockets flashed briefly. The men were thrust  bruisingly against the side of the corridor as the rocket spun lazily  on its axis. The side jets flared once more to halt the spin, when the  one-eighty turn was completed, and the men were battered against the  opposite wall, still weightless, still clinging to each other, still  struggling.\n\n\n Then the main-drive bellowed into life again, and the ship began to  battle against its own built-up acceleration. The corridor floor rose  up with blinking speed to smite them\u2014\n\n\n And the lights went out in a burst of crashing pain for Peter Duane. Someone was talking to him. Duane tried to force an eye open to see who  it was, and failed. Something damp and clinging was all about his face,  obscuring his vision. But the voice filtered in.\n\n\n \"Open your mouth,\" it said. \"Please, Peter, open your mouth. You're all  right. Just swallow this.\"\n\n\n It was a girl's voice. Duane was suddenly conscious that a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. He shook his head feebly.\n\n\n The voice became more insistent. \"Swallow this,\" it said. \"It's only a  stimulant, to help you throw off the shock of your\u2014accident. You're  all right, otherwise.\"\n\n\n Obediently he opened his mouth, and choked on a warm, tingly liquid.  He managed to swallow it, and lay quiet as deft feminine hands did  something to his face. Suddenly light filtered through his closed  eyelids, and cool air stirred against his damp face.\n\n\n He opened his eyes. A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. She stepped back a pace, a web of wet gauze bandage  in her hands, looking at him.\n\n\n \"Hello,\" he whispered. \"You\u2014where am I?\"\n\n\n \"In the sick bay,\" she said. \"You got caught out when the ship changed  course. Lucky you weren't hurt, Peter. The man you were with\u2014the old,  white-haired one, Stevens\u2014wasn't so lucky. He was underneath when the  jets went on. Three ribs broken\u2014his lung was punctured. He died in the  other room an hour ago.\"\n\n\n Duane screwed his eyes tight together and grimaced. When he opened  them again there was alertness and clarity in them\u2014but there was also  bafflement.\n\n\n \"Girl,\" he said, \"who are you? Where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Peter!\" There was shock and hurt in the tone of her voice. \"I'm\u2014don't  you know me, Peter?\"\n\n\n Duane shook his head confusedly. \"I don't know anything,\" he said.  \"I\u2014I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\n \"Duane, Duane,\" a man's heavy voice said. \"That won't wash. Don't play  dumb on me.\"\n\n\n \"Duane?\" he said. \"Duane....\" He swiveled his head and saw a dark,  squat man frowning at him. \"Who are you?\" Peter asked.\n\n\n The dark man laughed. \"Take your time, Duane,\" he said easily. \"You'll  remember me. My name's Andrias. I've been waiting here for you to wake  up. We have some business matters to discuss.\"\n\n\n The nurse, still eyeing Duane with an odd bewilderment, said: \"I'll  leave you alone for a moment. Don't talk too much to him, Mr. Andrias.  He's still suffering from shock.\"\n\n\n \"I won't,\" Andrias promised, grinning. Then, as the girl left the room,  the smile dropped from his face.\n\n\n \"You play rough, Duane,\" he observed. \"I thought you'd have trouble  with Stevens. I didn't think you'd find it necessary to put him out of  the way so permanently. Well, no matter. If you had to kill him, it's  no skin off my nose. Give me a release on the merchandise. I've got  your money here.\" Duane waved a hand and pushed himself dizzily erect, swinging his legs  over the side of the high cot. A sheet had been thrown over him, but he  was fully dressed. He examined his clothing with interest\u2014gray tunic,  gray leather spaceman's boots. It was unfamiliar.\n\n\n He shook his head in further confusion, and the motion burst within his  skull, throbbing hotly. He closed his eyes until it subsided, trying to  force his brain to operate, to explain to him where and what he was.\n\n\n He looked at the man named Andrias.\n\n\n \"Nobody seems to believe me,\" he said, \"but I really don't know what's  going on. Things are moving too fast for me. Really, I\u2014why, I don't  even know my own name! My head\u2014it hurts. I can't think clearly.\"\n\n\n Andrias straightened, turned a darkly-suspicious look on Duane. \"Don't  play tricks on me,\" he said savagely. \"I haven't time for them. I won't  mince words with you. Give me a release on the cargo now, before I have  to get rough. This is a lot more important to me than your life is.\"\n\n\n \"Go to hell,\" Duane said shortly. \"I'm playing no tricks.\"\n\n\n There was an instant's doubt in Andrias' eyes, then it flashed away. He  bent closer, peered at Duane. \"I almost think\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You're lying all right. You  killed Stevens to get his share\u2014and now you're trying to hold me up.  That's your last chance that just went by, Duane. From now on, I'm  running this show!\"\n\n\n He spun around and strode to the door, thrust it open. \"Dakin!\" he  bellowed. \"Reed!\"\n\n\n Two large, ugly men in field-gray uniforms, emblazoned with the  shooting-star insignia of Callisto's League police, came in, looking to  Andrias for instructions.\n\n\n \"Duane here is resisting arrest,\" Andrias said. \"Take him along. We'll  fix up the charges later.\"\n\n\n \"You can't do that,\" Duane said wearily. \"I'm sick. If you've got  something against me, save it. Wait till my head clears. I'm sure I can  explain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Explain, hell.\" The dark man laughed. \"If I wait, this ship will be  blasting off for Ganymede within two hours. I'll wait\u2014but so will the  ship. It's not going anywhere till I give it clearance. I run Callisto;  I'll give the orders here!\" II\n\n\n Whoever this man Andrias was, thought Duane, he was certainly a man of  importance on Callisto. As he had said, he gave the orders.\n\n\n The crew of the rocket made no objection when Andrias and his men took  Duane off without a word. Duane had thought the nurse, who seemed a  good enough sort, might have said something on his behalf. But she was  out of sight as they left. A curt sentence to a gray-clad official on  the blast field where the rocket lay, and the man nodded and hurried  off, to tell the rocket's captain that the ship was being refused  clearance indefinitely.\n\n\n A long, powerful ground car slid up before them. Andrias got in front,  while the two uniformed men shoved Duane into the back of the car,  climbed in beside him. Andrias gave a curt order, and the car shot  forward.\n\n\n The driver, sitting beside Andrias, leaned forward and readied a hand  under the dashboard. The high wail of a siren came instantly from the  car's roof, and what traffic was on the broad, straight highway into  which they had turned pulled aside to let them race through.\n\n\n Ahead lay the tall spires of a city. Graceful, hundreds of feet high,  they seemed dreamlike yet somehow oddly familiar to Duane. Somewhere  he had seen them before. He dragged deep into his mind, plumbing the  cloudy, impenetrable haze that had settled on it, trying to bring forth  the memories that he should have had. Amnesia, they called it; complete  forgetting of the happenings of a lifetime. He'd heard of it\u2014but never  dreamed it could happen to him! My name, it seems, is Peter Duane , he thought. And they tell me that  I killed a man! The thought was starkly incredible to him. A white-haired man, it had  been; someone named Stevens. He tried to remember.\n\n\n Yes, there had been a white-haired man. And there had been an argument.  Something to do with money, with a shipment of goods that Stevens had  supplied to Duane. There has even been talk of killing....\n\n\n But\u2014murder! Duane looked at his hands helplessly.\n\n\n Andrias, up ahead, was turning around. He looked sharply at Duane, for  a long second. An uncertainty clouded his eyes, and abruptly he looked  forward again without speaking.\n\n\n \"Who's this man Andrias?\" Duane whispered to the nearest guard.\n\n\n The man stared at him. \"Governor Andrias,\" he said, \"is the League's  deputy on Callisto. You know\u2014the Earth-Mars League. They put Governor  Andrias here to\u2014well, to govern for them.\"\n\n\n \"League?\" Duane asked, wrinkling his brow. He had heard something about  a League once, yes. But it was all so nebulous....\n\n\n The other guard stirred, leaned over. \"Shut up,\" he said heavily.  \"You'll have plenty of chance for talking later.\" But the chance was a long time in coming. Duane found himself, an hour  later, still in the barred room into which he'd been thrust. The guards  had brought him there, at Andrias' order, and left him. That had been  all.\n\n\n This was not a regular jail, Duane realized. It was more like a  palace, something out of Earth's Roman-empire days, all white stone  and frescoed walls. Duane wished for human companionship\u2014particularly  that of the nurse. Of all the people he'd met since awakening in that  hospital bed, only she seemed warm and human. The others were\u2014brutal,  deadly. It was too bad, Duane reflected, that he'd failed to remember  her. She'd seemed hurt, and she had certainly known him by first name.  But perhaps she would understand.\n\n\n Duane sat down on a lumpy, sagging bed and buried his head in his  hands. Dim ghosts of memory were wandering in his mind. He tried to  conjure them into stronger relief, or to exorcise them entirely.\n\n\n Somewhere, some time, a man had said to him, \" Andrias is secretly  arming the Callistan cutthroats for revolt against the League. He wants  personal power\u2014he's prepared to pay any price for it. He needs guns,  Earth guns smuggled in through the League patrol. If he can wipe out  the League police garrison\u2014those who are loyal to the League, still,  instead of to Andrias\u2014he can sit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and  Mars can send. Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless.  And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.  That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. \"\n\n\n Duane could remember the scene clearly. Could almost see the sharp,  aquiline face of the man who had spoken to him. But there memory  stopped.\n\n\n A fugitive recollection raced through his mind. He halted it, dragged  it back, pinned it down....\n\n\n They had stopped in Darkside, the spaceport on the side of Luna that  keeps perpetually averted from Earth, as if the moon knows shame and  wants to hide the rough and roaring dome city that nestles in one  of the great craters. Duane remembered sitting in a low-ceilinged,  smoke-heavy room, across the table from a tall man with white hair.  Stevens!\n\n\n \" Four thousand electron rifles ,\" the man had said. \" Latest  government issue. Never mind how I got them; they're perfect. You know  my price. Take it or leave it. And it's payable the minute we touch  ground on Callisto. \"\n\n\n There had been a few minutes of haggling over terms, then a handshake  and a drink from a thin-necked flagon of pale-yellow liquid fire.\n\n\n He and the white-haired man had gone out then, made their way by  unfrequented side streets to a great windowless building. Duane  remembered the white-hot stars overhead, shining piercingly through  the great transparent dome that kept the air in the sealed city of  Darkside, as they stood at the entrance of the warehouse and spoke in  low tones to the man who answered their summons.\n\n\n Then, inside. And they were looking at a huge chamber full of stacked  fiber boxes\u2014containing nothing but dehydrated dairy products and  mining tools, by the stencils they bore. Duane had turned to the  white-haired man with a puzzled question\u2014and the man had laughed aloud.\n\n\n He dragged one of the boxes down, ripped it open with the sharp point  of a handling hook. Short-barreled, flare-mouthed guns rolled out,  tumbling over the floor. Eight of them were in that one box, and  hundreds of boxes all about. Duane picked one up, broke it, peered into  the chamber where the tiny capsule of U-235 would explode with infinite  violence when the trigger was pulled, spraying radiant death three  thousand yards in the direction the gun was aimed....\n\n\n And that memory ended.\n\n\n Duane got up, stared at his haggard face in the cracked mirror over  the bed. \" They say I'm a killer ,\" he thought. \" Apparently I'm a  gun-runner as well. Good lord\u2014what am I not? \"\n\n\n His reflection\u2014white, drawn face made all the more pallid by the red  hair that blazed over it\u2014stared back at him. There was no answer  there. If only he could remember\u2014\n\n\n \"All right, Duane.\" The deep voice of a guard came to him as the door  swung open. \"Stop making eyes at yourself.\"\n\n\n Duane looked around. The guard beckoned. \"Governor Andrias wants to  speak to you\u2014now. Let's not keep the governor waiting.\" A long, narrow room, with a long carpet leading from the entrance up to  a great heavy desk\u2014that was Andrias' office. Duane felt a click in his  memory as he entered. One of the ancient Earth dictators had employed  just such a psychological trick to overawe those who came to beg favors  of him. Muslini, or some such name.\n\n\n The trick failed to work. Duane had other things on his mind; he walked  the thirty-foot length of the room, designed to imbue him with a sense  of his own unimportance, as steadily as he'd ever walked in the open  air of his home planet.\n\n\n Whichever planet that was.\n\n\n The guard had remained just inside the door, at attention. Andrias  waved him out.\n\n\n \"Here I am,\" said Duane. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Andrias said, \"I've had the ship inspected and what I want is on it.  That saves your life, for now. But the cargo is in your name. I could  take it by force, if I had to. I prefer not to.\" He picked up a paper,  handed it to Duane. \"In spite of your behavior, you can keep alive.  You can even collect the money for the guns\u2014Stevens' share as well  as your own. This is a release form, authorizing my men to take four  hundred and twenty cases of dehydrated foods and drilling supplies from  the hold of the Cameroon \u2014the ship you came on. Sign it, and we'll  forget our argument. Only, sign it now and get it over with. I'm losing  patience, Duane.\"\n\n\n Duane said, without expression, \"No.\"\n\n\n Dark red flooded into Andrias' sallow face. His jaws bunched angrily  and there was a ragged thread of incomplete control to his voice as he  spoke.\n\n\n \"I'll have your neck for this, Duane,\" he said softly.\n\n\n Duane looked at the man's eyes. Death was behind them, peeping out.  Mentally he shrugged. What difference did it make?\n\n\n \"Give me the pen,\" he said shortly.\n\n\n Andrias exhaled a deep breath. You could see the tension leave him, the  mottled anger fade from his face and leave it without expression. He  handed the paper to Duane without a word. He gave him a pen, watched  him scrawl his name.\n\n\n \"That,\" he said, \"is better.\" He paused a moment ruminatively. \"It  would have been better still if you'd not stalled me so long. I find  that hard to forgive in my associates.\"\n\n\n \"The money,\" Peter said. If he were playing a part\u2014pretending he knew  what he was doing\u2014he might as well play it to the hilt. \"When do I get  it?\"\n\n\n Andrias picked up the paper and looked carefully at the signature. He  creased it thoughtfully, stowed it in a pocket before answering.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" he said, \"there will have to be a revision of terms. I  offered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars. I would have paid  it\u2014but you made me angry. You'll have to pay for that.\" Duane said, \"I've paid already. I've been dragged from pillar to post  by you. That's enough. Pay me what you owe me, if you want any more of  the same goods!\"\n\n\n That was a shot in the dark\u2014and it missed the mark.\n\n\n Andrias' eyes widened. \"You amaze me, Duane,\" he said. He rose and  stepped around the desk, confronting Duane. \"I almost think you really  have lost your memory, Duane,\" he said. \"Otherwise, surely you would  know that this is all the rifles I need. With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"\n\n\n Duane said, \"You're ready, then....\"\n\n\n He took time to think it over, but he knew that no thought was  required. Already the hands that he had locked behind him were  clenched, taut. Already the muscles of his legs were tensing.\n\n\n \"You're ready,\" he repeated. \"You've armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the  worst gutter scum on nine planets. You're set to betray the League that  gave you power here.... Well, that changes things. I can't let you do  it!\"\n\n\n He hurled himself at Andrias, hands sweeping around to grapple for the  dark man's throat. Andrias, off-balance, staggered backward. But his  own hands were diving for the twin heat guns that hung at his waist.\n\n\n Duane saw his danger, and reacted. His foot twisted around Andrias'  ankle; his hands at the other's throat gripped tighter. He lunged  forward, slamming the hard top of his head into the other's face,  feeling flesh and cartilage give as Andrias' nose mashed flat. His own  head pin-wheeled dizzily, agonizingly, as the jar revived the pain of  his earlier accident.\n\n\n But Andrias, unconscious already, tumbled back with Duane on top of  him. His head made an audible, spine-chilling thud as it hit the  carpeted floor.\n\n\n Duane got up, retrieving the two heat guns, and stared at him.\n\n\n \" They tell me I killed Stevens the same way ,\" he thought. \" I'm  getting in a rut! \"\n\n\n But Andrias was not dead, though he was out as cold as the void beyond  Pluto. The thick carpeting had saved him from a broken head.\n\n\n Duane stepped over the unconscious man and looked around the room. It  was furnished severely, to the point of barrenness. Two chairs before  Andrias' ornate, bare-topped desk and one luxurious chair behind it;  a tasseled bell cord within easy reach of Andrias' chair; the long  carpet. That was all it contained.\n\n\n The problem of getting out was serious, he saw. How could one\u2014 III\n\n\n Methodically he ransacked the drawers of Andrias' desk. Papers, a  whole arsenal of hand guns, Callistan money by the bale, ominously  black-covered notebooks with cryptic figures littering their  pages\u2014those were the contents. A coldly impersonal desk, without the  familiar trivia most men accumulate. There was nothing, certainly, that  would get him out of a building that so closely resembled a fortress.\n\n\n He tumbled the things back into the drawers helter-skelter, turned  Andrias over and searched his pockets. More money\u2014the man must have  had a fortune within reach at all times\u2014and a few meaningless papers.  Duane took the release he had signed and tore it to shreds. But that  was only a gesture. When Andrias came to, unless Duane had managed to  get away and accomplish something, the mere lack of written permission  would not keep him from the rocket's lethal cargo!\n\n\n When Andrias came to....\n\n\n An idea bloomed in Duane's brain. He looked, then, at unconscious  Andrias\u2014and the idea withered again.\n\n\n He had thought of forcing Andrias himself to front for him, at gun's  point, in the conventional manner of escaping prisoners. But fist  fights, fiction to the contrary notwithstanding, leave marks on the men  who lose them. Andrias' throat was speckled with the livid marks of  Duane's fingers; Duane's head, butting Andrias in the face, had drawn a  thick stream of crimson from his nostrils, turned his sharp nose askew.\n\n\n No guard of Andrias' would have been deceived for an instant, looking  at that face\u2014even assuming that Andrias could have been forced to  cooperate by the threat of a gun. Which, considering the stake Andrias  had in this play, was doubtful....\n\n\n He stood up and looked around. He had to act quickly. Already Andrias'  breath was audible; he saw the man grimace and an arm flopped  spasmodically on the floor. Consciousness was on its way back.\n\n\n Duane touched the heat gun he'd thrust into his belt; drew it and held  it poised, while he sought to discover what was in his own mind. He'd  killed a man already, they said. Was he then a killer\u2014could he shoot  Andrias now, in cold blood, with so much to gain and nothing to lose?\n\n\n He stood there a moment. Then, abruptly, he reversed the weapon and  chopped it down on Andrias' skull.\n\n\n There was a sharp grunt from the still unconscious man, but no other  sign. Only\u2014the first tremors of movement that had shown on him halted,  and did not reappear.\n\n\n \" No ,\" Duane thought. \" Whatever they say, I'm not a killer! \"\n\n\n But still he had to get out. How?\n\n\n Once more he stared around the room, catalogued its contents. The guard  would be getting impatient. Perhaps any minute he would tap the door,  first timorously, then with heavier strokes.\n\n\n The guard! There was a way! Duane eyed the length of the room. Thirty feet\u2014it would take him a  couple of seconds to run it at full speed. Was that fast enough?\n\n\n There was only one way to find out.\n\n\n He walked around the desk to the bell cord. He took a deep breath,  tugged it savagely, and at once was in speedy motion, racing toward the  door, his footsteps muffled in the deep, springy carpet. Almost as he  reached it, he saw it begin to open. He quickly sidestepped and was out  of the guard's sight, behind the door, as the man looked in.\n\n\n Quick suspicion flared in his eyes, then certainty as he saw Andrias  huddled on the floor. He opened his mouth to cry out\u2014\n\n\n But Duane's arm was around his throat, and he had no breath to spare.  Duane's foot lashed out and the door slammed shut; Duane's balled left  fist came up and connected with the guard's chin. Abruptly the man  slumped.\n\n\n Duane took a deep breath and let the man drop to the floor. But he  paused only a second; now he had two unconscious men on his hands and  he dared let neither revive until he was prepared.\n\n\n He grasped the guard's arm and dragged him roughly the length of the  room. He leaped on top of the desk, brutally scarring its gleaming top  with the hard spikes of his boots. His agile fingers unfastened the  long bell cord without causing it to ring and, bearing it, he dropped  again to the floor.\n\n\n Tugging and straining, he got the limp form of Andrias into his own  chair, bound him with the bell cord, gagged him with the priceless  Venus-wool scarf Andrias wore knotted about his throat. He tested his  bindings with full strength, and smiled. Those would hold, let Andrias  struggle as he would.\n\n\n The guard he stripped of clothing, bound and gagged with his own  belt and spaceman's kerchief. He dragged him around behind the desk,  thrust him under it out of sight. Andrias' chair he turned so that the  unconscious face was averted from the door. Should anyone look in,  then, the fact of Andrias' unconsciousness might not be noticed.\n\n\n Then he took off his own clothes, quickly assumed the field-gray  uniform of the guard. It fit like the skin of a fruit. He felt himself  bulging out of it in a dozen places. The long cape the guard wore would  conceal that, perhaps. In any case, there was nothing better.\n\n\n Trying to make his stride as martial as possible, he walked down the  long carpet to the door, opened it and stepped outside. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Andrias feel uncertain?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was afraid he might not get the cargo\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He wasn't sure whether Duane had lost his memory or not\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He wasn't sure whether Duane had lost his memory or not\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He wasn't sure whether Duane had lost his memory or not\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Yet he could make no move,\n\n could favor no side\u2014his memory was gone\u2014he\n\n didn't know for whom he fought.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Duane's hand flicked to his waist and hung there, poised. His dis-gun  remained undrawn.\n\n\n The tall, white-haired man\u2014Stevens\u2014smiled.\n\n\n \"You're right, Duane,\" he said. \"I could blast you, too. Nobody would  win that way, so let's leave the guns where they are.\"\n\n\n The muscles twitched in Peter Duane's cheeks, but his voice, when it  came, was controlled. \"Don't think we're going to let this go,\" he  said. \"We'll take it up with Andrias tonight. We'll see whether you can  cut me out!\"\n\n\n The white-haired man's smile faded. He stepped forward, one hand  bracing him against the thrust of the rocket engines underneath,  holding to the guide rail at the side of the ship's corridor.\n\n\n He said, \"Duane, Andrias is your boss, not mine. I'm a free lance; I  work for myself. When we land on Callisto tonight I'll be with you when  you turn our\u2014shall I say, our cargo ?\u2014over to him. And I'll collect  my fair share of the proceeds. That's as far as it goes. I take no  orders from him.\"\n\n\n A heavy-set man in blue appeared at the end of the connecting corridor.  He was moving fast, but stopped short when he saw the two men.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he said. \"Change of course\u2014get to your cabins.\" He seemed about  to walk up to them, then reconsidered and hurried off. Neither man paid  any attention.\n\n\n Duane said, \"Do I have to kill you?\" It was only a question as he asked  it, without threatening.\n\n\n A muted alarm bell sounded through the P.A. speakers, signaling a  one-minute warning. The white-haired man cocked his eyebrow.\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" he said. He took the measure of his slim, red-headed  opponent. Taller, heavier, older, he was still no more uncompromisingly  belligerent than Duane, standing there. \"Not at all,\" he repeated.  \"Just take your ten thousand and let it go at that. Don't make trouble.  Leave Andrias out of our private argument.\"\n\n\n \"Damn you!\" Duane flared. \"I was promised fifty thousand. I need that  money. Do you think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget what I think,\" Stevens said, his voice clipped and angry. \"I  don't care about fairness, Duane, except to myself. I've done all the  work on this\u2014I've supplied the goods. My price is set, a hundred  thousand Earth dollars. What Andrias promised you is no concern of  mine. The fact is that, after I've taken my share, there's only ten  thousand left. That's all you get!\"\n\n\n Duane stared at him a long second, then nodded abruptly. \"I was right  the first time,\" he said. \"I'll have to kill you!\" Already his hand was streaking toward the grip of his dis-gun, touching  it, drawing it forth. But the white-haired man was faster. His arms  swept up and pinioned Duane, holding him impotent.\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool,\" he grated. \"Duane\u2014\"\n\n\n The P.A. speaker rattled, blared something unintelligible. Neither man  heard it. Duane lunged forward into the taller man's grip, sliding down  to the floor. The white-haired man grappled furiously to keep his hold  on Peter's gun arm, but Peter was slipping away. Belatedly, Stevens  went for his own gun.\n\n\n He was too late. Duane's was out and leveled at him.\n\n\n \" Now will you listen to reason?\" Duane panted. But he halted, and the  muzzle of his weapon wavered. The floor swooped and surged beneath him  as the thrust of the mighty jets was cut off. Suddenly there was no  gravity. The two men, locked together, floated weightlessly out to the  center of the corridor.\n\n\n \"Course change!\" gasped white-haired Stevens. \"Good God!\"\n\n\n The ship had reached the midpoint of its flight. The bells had sounded,  warning every soul on it to take shelter, to strap themselves in their  pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship  reversed itself and began to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto.  But the two men had not heeded.\n\n\n The small steering rockets flashed briefly. The men were thrust  bruisingly against the side of the corridor as the rocket spun lazily  on its axis. The side jets flared once more to halt the spin, when the  one-eighty turn was completed, and the men were battered against the  opposite wall, still weightless, still clinging to each other, still  struggling.\n\n\n Then the main-drive bellowed into life again, and the ship began to  battle against its own built-up acceleration. The corridor floor rose  up with blinking speed to smite them\u2014\n\n\n And the lights went out in a burst of crashing pain for Peter Duane. Someone was talking to him. Duane tried to force an eye open to see who  it was, and failed. Something damp and clinging was all about his face,  obscuring his vision. But the voice filtered in.\n\n\n \"Open your mouth,\" it said. \"Please, Peter, open your mouth. You're all  right. Just swallow this.\"\n\n\n It was a girl's voice. Duane was suddenly conscious that a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. He shook his head feebly.\n\n\n The voice became more insistent. \"Swallow this,\" it said. \"It's only a  stimulant, to help you throw off the shock of your\u2014accident. You're  all right, otherwise.\"\n\n\n Obediently he opened his mouth, and choked on a warm, tingly liquid.  He managed to swallow it, and lay quiet as deft feminine hands did  something to his face. Suddenly light filtered through his closed  eyelids, and cool air stirred against his damp face.\n\n\n He opened his eyes. A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. She stepped back a pace, a web of wet gauze bandage  in her hands, looking at him.\n\n\n \"Hello,\" he whispered. \"You\u2014where am I?\"\n\n\n \"In the sick bay,\" she said. \"You got caught out when the ship changed  course. Lucky you weren't hurt, Peter. The man you were with\u2014the old,  white-haired one, Stevens\u2014wasn't so lucky. He was underneath when the  jets went on. Three ribs broken\u2014his lung was punctured. He died in the  other room an hour ago.\"\n\n\n Duane screwed his eyes tight together and grimaced. When he opened  them again there was alertness and clarity in them\u2014but there was also  bafflement.\n\n\n \"Girl,\" he said, \"who are you? Where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Peter!\" There was shock and hurt in the tone of her voice. \"I'm\u2014don't  you know me, Peter?\"\n\n\n Duane shook his head confusedly. \"I don't know anything,\" he said.  \"I\u2014I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\n \"Duane, Duane,\" a man's heavy voice said. \"That won't wash. Don't play  dumb on me.\"\n\n\n \"Duane?\" he said. \"Duane....\" He swiveled his head and saw a dark,  squat man frowning at him. \"Who are you?\" Peter asked.\n\n\n The dark man laughed. \"Take your time, Duane,\" he said easily. \"You'll  remember me. My name's Andrias. I've been waiting here for you to wake  up. We have some business matters to discuss.\"\n\n\n The nurse, still eyeing Duane with an odd bewilderment, said: \"I'll  leave you alone for a moment. Don't talk too much to him, Mr. Andrias.  He's still suffering from shock.\"\n\n\n \"I won't,\" Andrias promised, grinning. Then, as the girl left the room,  the smile dropped from his face.\n\n\n \"You play rough, Duane,\" he observed. \"I thought you'd have trouble  with Stevens. I didn't think you'd find it necessary to put him out of  the way so permanently. Well, no matter. If you had to kill him, it's  no skin off my nose. Give me a release on the merchandise. I've got  your money here.\" Duane waved a hand and pushed himself dizzily erect, swinging his legs  over the side of the high cot. A sheet had been thrown over him, but he  was fully dressed. He examined his clothing with interest\u2014gray tunic,  gray leather spaceman's boots. It was unfamiliar.\n\n\n He shook his head in further confusion, and the motion burst within his  skull, throbbing hotly. He closed his eyes until it subsided, trying to  force his brain to operate, to explain to him where and what he was.\n\n\n He looked at the man named Andrias.\n\n\n \"Nobody seems to believe me,\" he said, \"but I really don't know what's  going on. Things are moving too fast for me. Really, I\u2014why, I don't  even know my own name! My head\u2014it hurts. I can't think clearly.\"\n\n\n Andrias straightened, turned a darkly-suspicious look on Duane. \"Don't  play tricks on me,\" he said savagely. \"I haven't time for them. I won't  mince words with you. Give me a release on the cargo now, before I have  to get rough. This is a lot more important to me than your life is.\"\n\n\n \"Go to hell,\" Duane said shortly. \"I'm playing no tricks.\"\n\n\n There was an instant's doubt in Andrias' eyes, then it flashed away. He  bent closer, peered at Duane. \"I almost think\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You're lying all right. You  killed Stevens to get his share\u2014and now you're trying to hold me up.  That's your last chance that just went by, Duane. From now on, I'm  running this show!\"\n\n\n He spun around and strode to the door, thrust it open. \"Dakin!\" he  bellowed. \"Reed!\"\n\n\n Two large, ugly men in field-gray uniforms, emblazoned with the  shooting-star insignia of Callisto's League police, came in, looking to  Andrias for instructions.\n\n\n \"Duane here is resisting arrest,\" Andrias said. \"Take him along. We'll  fix up the charges later.\"\n\n\n \"You can't do that,\" Duane said wearily. \"I'm sick. If you've got  something against me, save it. Wait till my head clears. I'm sure I can  explain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Explain, hell.\" The dark man laughed. \"If I wait, this ship will be  blasting off for Ganymede within two hours. I'll wait\u2014but so will the  ship. It's not going anywhere till I give it clearance. I run Callisto;  I'll give the orders here!\" II\n\n\n Whoever this man Andrias was, thought Duane, he was certainly a man of  importance on Callisto. As he had said, he gave the orders.\n\n\n The crew of the rocket made no objection when Andrias and his men took  Duane off without a word. Duane had thought the nurse, who seemed a  good enough sort, might have said something on his behalf. But she was  out of sight as they left. A curt sentence to a gray-clad official on  the blast field where the rocket lay, and the man nodded and hurried  off, to tell the rocket's captain that the ship was being refused  clearance indefinitely.\n\n\n A long, powerful ground car slid up before them. Andrias got in front,  while the two uniformed men shoved Duane into the back of the car,  climbed in beside him. Andrias gave a curt order, and the car shot  forward.\n\n\n The driver, sitting beside Andrias, leaned forward and readied a hand  under the dashboard. The high wail of a siren came instantly from the  car's roof, and what traffic was on the broad, straight highway into  which they had turned pulled aside to let them race through.\n\n\n Ahead lay the tall spires of a city. Graceful, hundreds of feet high,  they seemed dreamlike yet somehow oddly familiar to Duane. Somewhere  he had seen them before. He dragged deep into his mind, plumbing the  cloudy, impenetrable haze that had settled on it, trying to bring forth  the memories that he should have had. Amnesia, they called it; complete  forgetting of the happenings of a lifetime. He'd heard of it\u2014but never  dreamed it could happen to him! My name, it seems, is Peter Duane , he thought. And they tell me that  I killed a man! The thought was starkly incredible to him. A white-haired man, it had  been; someone named Stevens. He tried to remember.\n\n\n Yes, there had been a white-haired man. And there had been an argument.  Something to do with money, with a shipment of goods that Stevens had  supplied to Duane. There has even been talk of killing....\n\n\n But\u2014murder! Duane looked at his hands helplessly.\n\n\n Andrias, up ahead, was turning around. He looked sharply at Duane, for  a long second. An uncertainty clouded his eyes, and abruptly he looked  forward again without speaking.\n\n\n \"Who's this man Andrias?\" Duane whispered to the nearest guard.\n\n\n The man stared at him. \"Governor Andrias,\" he said, \"is the League's  deputy on Callisto. You know\u2014the Earth-Mars League. They put Governor  Andrias here to\u2014well, to govern for them.\"\n\n\n \"League?\" Duane asked, wrinkling his brow. He had heard something about  a League once, yes. But it was all so nebulous....\n\n\n The other guard stirred, leaned over. \"Shut up,\" he said heavily.  \"You'll have plenty of chance for talking later.\" But the chance was a long time in coming. Duane found himself, an hour  later, still in the barred room into which he'd been thrust. The guards  had brought him there, at Andrias' order, and left him. That had been  all.\n\n\n This was not a regular jail, Duane realized. It was more like a  palace, something out of Earth's Roman-empire days, all white stone  and frescoed walls. Duane wished for human companionship\u2014particularly  that of the nurse. Of all the people he'd met since awakening in that  hospital bed, only she seemed warm and human. The others were\u2014brutal,  deadly. It was too bad, Duane reflected, that he'd failed to remember  her. She'd seemed hurt, and she had certainly known him by first name.  But perhaps she would understand.\n\n\n Duane sat down on a lumpy, sagging bed and buried his head in his  hands. Dim ghosts of memory were wandering in his mind. He tried to  conjure them into stronger relief, or to exorcise them entirely.\n\n\n Somewhere, some time, a man had said to him, \" Andrias is secretly  arming the Callistan cutthroats for revolt against the League. He wants  personal power\u2014he's prepared to pay any price for it. He needs guns,  Earth guns smuggled in through the League patrol. If he can wipe out  the League police garrison\u2014those who are loyal to the League, still,  instead of to Andrias\u2014he can sit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and  Mars can send. Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless.  And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.  That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. \"\n\n\n Duane could remember the scene clearly. Could almost see the sharp,  aquiline face of the man who had spoken to him. But there memory  stopped.\n\n\n A fugitive recollection raced through his mind. He halted it, dragged  it back, pinned it down....\n\n\n They had stopped in Darkside, the spaceport on the side of Luna that  keeps perpetually averted from Earth, as if the moon knows shame and  wants to hide the rough and roaring dome city that nestles in one  of the great craters. Duane remembered sitting in a low-ceilinged,  smoke-heavy room, across the table from a tall man with white hair.  Stevens!\n\n\n \" Four thousand electron rifles ,\" the man had said. \" Latest  government issue. Never mind how I got them; they're perfect. You know  my price. Take it or leave it. And it's payable the minute we touch  ground on Callisto. \"\n\n\n There had been a few minutes of haggling over terms, then a handshake  and a drink from a thin-necked flagon of pale-yellow liquid fire.\n\n\n He and the white-haired man had gone out then, made their way by  unfrequented side streets to a great windowless building. Duane  remembered the white-hot stars overhead, shining piercingly through  the great transparent dome that kept the air in the sealed city of  Darkside, as they stood at the entrance of the warehouse and spoke in  low tones to the man who answered their summons.\n\n\n Then, inside. And they were looking at a huge chamber full of stacked  fiber boxes\u2014containing nothing but dehydrated dairy products and  mining tools, by the stencils they bore. Duane had turned to the  white-haired man with a puzzled question\u2014and the man had laughed aloud.\n\n\n He dragged one of the boxes down, ripped it open with the sharp point  of a handling hook. Short-barreled, flare-mouthed guns rolled out,  tumbling over the floor. Eight of them were in that one box, and  hundreds of boxes all about. Duane picked one up, broke it, peered into  the chamber where the tiny capsule of U-235 would explode with infinite  violence when the trigger was pulled, spraying radiant death three  thousand yards in the direction the gun was aimed....\n\n\n And that memory ended.\n\n\n Duane got up, stared at his haggard face in the cracked mirror over  the bed. \" They say I'm a killer ,\" he thought. \" Apparently I'm a  gun-runner as well. Good lord\u2014what am I not? \"\n\n\n His reflection\u2014white, drawn face made all the more pallid by the red  hair that blazed over it\u2014stared back at him. There was no answer  there. If only he could remember\u2014\n\n\n \"All right, Duane.\" The deep voice of a guard came to him as the door  swung open. \"Stop making eyes at yourself.\"\n\n\n Duane looked around. The guard beckoned. \"Governor Andrias wants to  speak to you\u2014now. Let's not keep the governor waiting.\" A long, narrow room, with a long carpet leading from the entrance up to  a great heavy desk\u2014that was Andrias' office. Duane felt a click in his  memory as he entered. One of the ancient Earth dictators had employed  just such a psychological trick to overawe those who came to beg favors  of him. Muslini, or some such name.\n\n\n The trick failed to work. Duane had other things on his mind; he walked  the thirty-foot length of the room, designed to imbue him with a sense  of his own unimportance, as steadily as he'd ever walked in the open  air of his home planet.\n\n\n Whichever planet that was.\n\n\n The guard had remained just inside the door, at attention. Andrias  waved him out.\n\n\n \"Here I am,\" said Duane. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Andrias said, \"I've had the ship inspected and what I want is on it.  That saves your life, for now. But the cargo is in your name. I could  take it by force, if I had to. I prefer not to.\" He picked up a paper,  handed it to Duane. \"In spite of your behavior, you can keep alive.  You can even collect the money for the guns\u2014Stevens' share as well  as your own. This is a release form, authorizing my men to take four  hundred and twenty cases of dehydrated foods and drilling supplies from  the hold of the Cameroon \u2014the ship you came on. Sign it, and we'll  forget our argument. Only, sign it now and get it over with. I'm losing  patience, Duane.\"\n\n\n Duane said, without expression, \"No.\"\n\n\n Dark red flooded into Andrias' sallow face. His jaws bunched angrily  and there was a ragged thread of incomplete control to his voice as he  spoke.\n\n\n \"I'll have your neck for this, Duane,\" he said softly.\n\n\n Duane looked at the man's eyes. Death was behind them, peeping out.  Mentally he shrugged. What difference did it make?\n\n\n \"Give me the pen,\" he said shortly.\n\n\n Andrias exhaled a deep breath. You could see the tension leave him, the  mottled anger fade from his face and leave it without expression. He  handed the paper to Duane without a word. He gave him a pen, watched  him scrawl his name.\n\n\n \"That,\" he said, \"is better.\" He paused a moment ruminatively. \"It  would have been better still if you'd not stalled me so long. I find  that hard to forgive in my associates.\"\n\n\n \"The money,\" Peter said. If he were playing a part\u2014pretending he knew  what he was doing\u2014he might as well play it to the hilt. \"When do I get  it?\"\n\n\n Andrias picked up the paper and looked carefully at the signature. He  creased it thoughtfully, stowed it in a pocket before answering.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" he said, \"there will have to be a revision of terms. I  offered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars. I would have paid  it\u2014but you made me angry. You'll have to pay for that.\" Duane said, \"I've paid already. I've been dragged from pillar to post  by you. That's enough. Pay me what you owe me, if you want any more of  the same goods!\"\n\n\n That was a shot in the dark\u2014and it missed the mark.\n\n\n Andrias' eyes widened. \"You amaze me, Duane,\" he said. He rose and  stepped around the desk, confronting Duane. \"I almost think you really  have lost your memory, Duane,\" he said. \"Otherwise, surely you would  know that this is all the rifles I need. With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"\n\n\n Duane said, \"You're ready, then....\"\n\n\n He took time to think it over, but he knew that no thought was  required. Already the hands that he had locked behind him were  clenched, taut. Already the muscles of his legs were tensing.\n\n\n \"You're ready,\" he repeated. \"You've armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the  worst gutter scum on nine planets. You're set to betray the League that  gave you power here.... Well, that changes things. I can't let you do  it!\"\n\n\n He hurled himself at Andrias, hands sweeping around to grapple for the  dark man's throat. Andrias, off-balance, staggered backward. But his  own hands were diving for the twin heat guns that hung at his waist.\n\n\n Duane saw his danger, and reacted. His foot twisted around Andrias'  ankle; his hands at the other's throat gripped tighter. He lunged  forward, slamming the hard top of his head into the other's face,  feeling flesh and cartilage give as Andrias' nose mashed flat. His own  head pin-wheeled dizzily, agonizingly, as the jar revived the pain of  his earlier accident.\n\n\n But Andrias, unconscious already, tumbled back with Duane on top of  him. His head made an audible, spine-chilling thud as it hit the  carpeted floor.\n\n\n Duane got up, retrieving the two heat guns, and stared at him.\n\n\n \" They tell me I killed Stevens the same way ,\" he thought. \" I'm  getting in a rut! \"\n\n\n But Andrias was not dead, though he was out as cold as the void beyond  Pluto. The thick carpeting had saved him from a broken head.\n\n\n Duane stepped over the unconscious man and looked around the room. It  was furnished severely, to the point of barrenness. Two chairs before  Andrias' ornate, bare-topped desk and one luxurious chair behind it;  a tasseled bell cord within easy reach of Andrias' chair; the long  carpet. That was all it contained.\n\n\n The problem of getting out was serious, he saw. How could one\u2014 III\n\n\n Methodically he ransacked the drawers of Andrias' desk. Papers, a  whole arsenal of hand guns, Callistan money by the bale, ominously  black-covered notebooks with cryptic figures littering their  pages\u2014those were the contents. A coldly impersonal desk, without the  familiar trivia most men accumulate. There was nothing, certainly, that  would get him out of a building that so closely resembled a fortress.\n\n\n He tumbled the things back into the drawers helter-skelter, turned  Andrias over and searched his pockets. More money\u2014the man must have  had a fortune within reach at all times\u2014and a few meaningless papers.  Duane took the release he had signed and tore it to shreds. But that  was only a gesture. When Andrias came to, unless Duane had managed to  get away and accomplish something, the mere lack of written permission  would not keep him from the rocket's lethal cargo!\n\n\n When Andrias came to....\n\n\n An idea bloomed in Duane's brain. He looked, then, at unconscious  Andrias\u2014and the idea withered again.\n\n\n He had thought of forcing Andrias himself to front for him, at gun's  point, in the conventional manner of escaping prisoners. But fist  fights, fiction to the contrary notwithstanding, leave marks on the men  who lose them. Andrias' throat was speckled with the livid marks of  Duane's fingers; Duane's head, butting Andrias in the face, had drawn a  thick stream of crimson from his nostrils, turned his sharp nose askew.\n\n\n No guard of Andrias' would have been deceived for an instant, looking  at that face\u2014even assuming that Andrias could have been forced to  cooperate by the threat of a gun. Which, considering the stake Andrias  had in this play, was doubtful....\n\n\n He stood up and looked around. He had to act quickly. Already Andrias'  breath was audible; he saw the man grimace and an arm flopped  spasmodically on the floor. Consciousness was on its way back.\n\n\n Duane touched the heat gun he'd thrust into his belt; drew it and held  it poised, while he sought to discover what was in his own mind. He'd  killed a man already, they said. Was he then a killer\u2014could he shoot  Andrias now, in cold blood, with so much to gain and nothing to lose?\n\n\n He stood there a moment. Then, abruptly, he reversed the weapon and  chopped it down on Andrias' skull.\n\n\n There was a sharp grunt from the still unconscious man, but no other  sign. Only\u2014the first tremors of movement that had shown on him halted,  and did not reappear.\n\n\n \" No ,\" Duane thought. \" Whatever they say, I'm not a killer! \"\n\n\n But still he had to get out. How?\n\n\n Once more he stared around the room, catalogued its contents. The guard  would be getting impatient. Perhaps any minute he would tap the door,  first timorously, then with heavier strokes.\n\n\n The guard! There was a way! Duane eyed the length of the room. Thirty feet\u2014it would take him a  couple of seconds to run it at full speed. Was that fast enough?\n\n\n There was only one way to find out.\n\n\n He walked around the desk to the bell cord. He took a deep breath,  tugged it savagely, and at once was in speedy motion, racing toward the  door, his footsteps muffled in the deep, springy carpet. Almost as he  reached it, he saw it begin to open. He quickly sidestepped and was out  of the guard's sight, behind the door, as the man looked in.\n\n\n Quick suspicion flared in his eyes, then certainty as he saw Andrias  huddled on the floor. He opened his mouth to cry out\u2014\n\n\n But Duane's arm was around his throat, and he had no breath to spare.  Duane's foot lashed out and the door slammed shut; Duane's balled left  fist came up and connected with the guard's chin. Abruptly the man  slumped.\n\n\n Duane took a deep breath and let the man drop to the floor. But he  paused only a second; now he had two unconscious men on his hands and  he dared let neither revive until he was prepared.\n\n\n He grasped the guard's arm and dragged him roughly the length of the  room. He leaped on top of the desk, brutally scarring its gleaming top  with the hard spikes of his boots. His agile fingers unfastened the  long bell cord without causing it to ring and, bearing it, he dropped  again to the floor.\n\n\n Tugging and straining, he got the limp form of Andrias into his own  chair, bound him with the bell cord, gagged him with the priceless  Venus-wool scarf Andrias wore knotted about his throat. He tested his  bindings with full strength, and smiled. Those would hold, let Andrias  struggle as he would.\n\n\n The guard he stripped of clothing, bound and gagged with his own  belt and spaceman's kerchief. He dragged him around behind the desk,  thrust him under it out of sight. Andrias' chair he turned so that the  unconscious face was averted from the door. Should anyone look in,  then, the fact of Andrias' unconsciousness might not be noticed.\n\n\n Then he took off his own clothes, quickly assumed the field-gray  uniform of the guard. It fit like the skin of a fruit. He felt himself  bulging out of it in a dozen places. The long cape the guard wore would  conceal that, perhaps. In any case, there was nothing better.\n\n\n Trying to make his stride as martial as possible, he walked down the  long carpet to the door, opened it and stepped outside. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Andrias feel uncertain?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He wasn't sure whether Duane had lost his memory or not\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was afraid he might not get the cargo\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was afraid he might not get the cargo\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was afraid he might not get the cargo\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Yet he could make no move,\n\n could favor no side\u2014his memory was gone\u2014he\n\n didn't know for whom he fought.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Duane's hand flicked to his waist and hung there, poised. His dis-gun  remained undrawn.\n\n\n The tall, white-haired man\u2014Stevens\u2014smiled.\n\n\n \"You're right, Duane,\" he said. \"I could blast you, too. Nobody would  win that way, so let's leave the guns where they are.\"\n\n\n The muscles twitched in Peter Duane's cheeks, but his voice, when it  came, was controlled. \"Don't think we're going to let this go,\" he  said. \"We'll take it up with Andrias tonight. We'll see whether you can  cut me out!\"\n\n\n The white-haired man's smile faded. He stepped forward, one hand  bracing him against the thrust of the rocket engines underneath,  holding to the guide rail at the side of the ship's corridor.\n\n\n He said, \"Duane, Andrias is your boss, not mine. I'm a free lance; I  work for myself. When we land on Callisto tonight I'll be with you when  you turn our\u2014shall I say, our cargo ?\u2014over to him. And I'll collect  my fair share of the proceeds. That's as far as it goes. I take no  orders from him.\"\n\n\n A heavy-set man in blue appeared at the end of the connecting corridor.  He was moving fast, but stopped short when he saw the two men.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he said. \"Change of course\u2014get to your cabins.\" He seemed about  to walk up to them, then reconsidered and hurried off. Neither man paid  any attention.\n\n\n Duane said, \"Do I have to kill you?\" It was only a question as he asked  it, without threatening.\n\n\n A muted alarm bell sounded through the P.A. speakers, signaling a  one-minute warning. The white-haired man cocked his eyebrow.\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" he said. He took the measure of his slim, red-headed  opponent. Taller, heavier, older, he was still no more uncompromisingly  belligerent than Duane, standing there. \"Not at all,\" he repeated.  \"Just take your ten thousand and let it go at that. Don't make trouble.  Leave Andrias out of our private argument.\"\n\n\n \"Damn you!\" Duane flared. \"I was promised fifty thousand. I need that  money. Do you think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget what I think,\" Stevens said, his voice clipped and angry. \"I  don't care about fairness, Duane, except to myself. I've done all the  work on this\u2014I've supplied the goods. My price is set, a hundred  thousand Earth dollars. What Andrias promised you is no concern of  mine. The fact is that, after I've taken my share, there's only ten  thousand left. That's all you get!\"\n\n\n Duane stared at him a long second, then nodded abruptly. \"I was right  the first time,\" he said. \"I'll have to kill you!\" Already his hand was streaking toward the grip of his dis-gun, touching  it, drawing it forth. But the white-haired man was faster. His arms  swept up and pinioned Duane, holding him impotent.\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool,\" he grated. \"Duane\u2014\"\n\n\n The P.A. speaker rattled, blared something unintelligible. Neither man  heard it. Duane lunged forward into the taller man's grip, sliding down  to the floor. The white-haired man grappled furiously to keep his hold  on Peter's gun arm, but Peter was slipping away. Belatedly, Stevens  went for his own gun.\n\n\n He was too late. Duane's was out and leveled at him.\n\n\n \" Now will you listen to reason?\" Duane panted. But he halted, and the  muzzle of his weapon wavered. The floor swooped and surged beneath him  as the thrust of the mighty jets was cut off. Suddenly there was no  gravity. The two men, locked together, floated weightlessly out to the  center of the corridor.\n\n\n \"Course change!\" gasped white-haired Stevens. \"Good God!\"\n\n\n The ship had reached the midpoint of its flight. The bells had sounded,  warning every soul on it to take shelter, to strap themselves in their  pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship  reversed itself and began to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto.  But the two men had not heeded.\n\n\n The small steering rockets flashed briefly. The men were thrust  bruisingly against the side of the corridor as the rocket spun lazily  on its axis. The side jets flared once more to halt the spin, when the  one-eighty turn was completed, and the men were battered against the  opposite wall, still weightless, still clinging to each other, still  struggling.\n\n\n Then the main-drive bellowed into life again, and the ship began to  battle against its own built-up acceleration. The corridor floor rose  up with blinking speed to smite them\u2014\n\n\n And the lights went out in a burst of crashing pain for Peter Duane. Someone was talking to him. Duane tried to force an eye open to see who  it was, and failed. Something damp and clinging was all about his face,  obscuring his vision. But the voice filtered in.\n\n\n \"Open your mouth,\" it said. \"Please, Peter, open your mouth. You're all  right. Just swallow this.\"\n\n\n It was a girl's voice. Duane was suddenly conscious that a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. He shook his head feebly.\n\n\n The voice became more insistent. \"Swallow this,\" it said. \"It's only a  stimulant, to help you throw off the shock of your\u2014accident. You're  all right, otherwise.\"\n\n\n Obediently he opened his mouth, and choked on a warm, tingly liquid.  He managed to swallow it, and lay quiet as deft feminine hands did  something to his face. Suddenly light filtered through his closed  eyelids, and cool air stirred against his damp face.\n\n\n He opened his eyes. A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. She stepped back a pace, a web of wet gauze bandage  in her hands, looking at him.\n\n\n \"Hello,\" he whispered. \"You\u2014where am I?\"\n\n\n \"In the sick bay,\" she said. \"You got caught out when the ship changed  course. Lucky you weren't hurt, Peter. The man you were with\u2014the old,  white-haired one, Stevens\u2014wasn't so lucky. He was underneath when the  jets went on. Three ribs broken\u2014his lung was punctured. He died in the  other room an hour ago.\"\n\n\n Duane screwed his eyes tight together and grimaced. When he opened  them again there was alertness and clarity in them\u2014but there was also  bafflement.\n\n\n \"Girl,\" he said, \"who are you? Where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Peter!\" There was shock and hurt in the tone of her voice. \"I'm\u2014don't  you know me, Peter?\"\n\n\n Duane shook his head confusedly. \"I don't know anything,\" he said.  \"I\u2014I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\n \"Duane, Duane,\" a man's heavy voice said. \"That won't wash. Don't play  dumb on me.\"\n\n\n \"Duane?\" he said. \"Duane....\" He swiveled his head and saw a dark,  squat man frowning at him. \"Who are you?\" Peter asked.\n\n\n The dark man laughed. \"Take your time, Duane,\" he said easily. \"You'll  remember me. My name's Andrias. I've been waiting here for you to wake  up. We have some business matters to discuss.\"\n\n\n The nurse, still eyeing Duane with an odd bewilderment, said: \"I'll  leave you alone for a moment. Don't talk too much to him, Mr. Andrias.  He's still suffering from shock.\"\n\n\n \"I won't,\" Andrias promised, grinning. Then, as the girl left the room,  the smile dropped from his face.\n\n\n \"You play rough, Duane,\" he observed. \"I thought you'd have trouble  with Stevens. I didn't think you'd find it necessary to put him out of  the way so permanently. Well, no matter. If you had to kill him, it's  no skin off my nose. Give me a release on the merchandise. I've got  your money here.\" Duane waved a hand and pushed himself dizzily erect, swinging his legs  over the side of the high cot. A sheet had been thrown over him, but he  was fully dressed. He examined his clothing with interest\u2014gray tunic,  gray leather spaceman's boots. It was unfamiliar.\n\n\n He shook his head in further confusion, and the motion burst within his  skull, throbbing hotly. He closed his eyes until it subsided, trying to  force his brain to operate, to explain to him where and what he was.\n\n\n He looked at the man named Andrias.\n\n\n \"Nobody seems to believe me,\" he said, \"but I really don't know what's  going on. Things are moving too fast for me. Really, I\u2014why, I don't  even know my own name! My head\u2014it hurts. I can't think clearly.\"\n\n\n Andrias straightened, turned a darkly-suspicious look on Duane. \"Don't  play tricks on me,\" he said savagely. \"I haven't time for them. I won't  mince words with you. Give me a release on the cargo now, before I have  to get rough. This is a lot more important to me than your life is.\"\n\n\n \"Go to hell,\" Duane said shortly. \"I'm playing no tricks.\"\n\n\n There was an instant's doubt in Andrias' eyes, then it flashed away. He  bent closer, peered at Duane. \"I almost think\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You're lying all right. You  killed Stevens to get his share\u2014and now you're trying to hold me up.  That's your last chance that just went by, Duane. From now on, I'm  running this show!\"\n\n\n He spun around and strode to the door, thrust it open. \"Dakin!\" he  bellowed. \"Reed!\"\n\n\n Two large, ugly men in field-gray uniforms, emblazoned with the  shooting-star insignia of Callisto's League police, came in, looking to  Andrias for instructions.\n\n\n \"Duane here is resisting arrest,\" Andrias said. \"Take him along. We'll  fix up the charges later.\"\n\n\n \"You can't do that,\" Duane said wearily. \"I'm sick. If you've got  something against me, save it. Wait till my head clears. I'm sure I can  explain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Explain, hell.\" The dark man laughed. \"If I wait, this ship will be  blasting off for Ganymede within two hours. I'll wait\u2014but so will the  ship. It's not going anywhere till I give it clearance. I run Callisto;  I'll give the orders here!\" II\n\n\n Whoever this man Andrias was, thought Duane, he was certainly a man of  importance on Callisto. As he had said, he gave the orders.\n\n\n The crew of the rocket made no objection when Andrias and his men took  Duane off without a word. Duane had thought the nurse, who seemed a  good enough sort, might have said something on his behalf. But she was  out of sight as they left. A curt sentence to a gray-clad official on  the blast field where the rocket lay, and the man nodded and hurried  off, to tell the rocket's captain that the ship was being refused  clearance indefinitely.\n\n\n A long, powerful ground car slid up before them. Andrias got in front,  while the two uniformed men shoved Duane into the back of the car,  climbed in beside him. Andrias gave a curt order, and the car shot  forward.\n\n\n The driver, sitting beside Andrias, leaned forward and readied a hand  under the dashboard. The high wail of a siren came instantly from the  car's roof, and what traffic was on the broad, straight highway into  which they had turned pulled aside to let them race through.\n\n\n Ahead lay the tall spires of a city. Graceful, hundreds of feet high,  they seemed dreamlike yet somehow oddly familiar to Duane. Somewhere  he had seen them before. He dragged deep into his mind, plumbing the  cloudy, impenetrable haze that had settled on it, trying to bring forth  the memories that he should have had. Amnesia, they called it; complete  forgetting of the happenings of a lifetime. He'd heard of it\u2014but never  dreamed it could happen to him! My name, it seems, is Peter Duane , he thought. And they tell me that  I killed a man! The thought was starkly incredible to him. A white-haired man, it had  been; someone named Stevens. He tried to remember.\n\n\n Yes, there had been a white-haired man. And there had been an argument.  Something to do with money, with a shipment of goods that Stevens had  supplied to Duane. There has even been talk of killing....\n\n\n But\u2014murder! Duane looked at his hands helplessly.\n\n\n Andrias, up ahead, was turning around. He looked sharply at Duane, for  a long second. An uncertainty clouded his eyes, and abruptly he looked  forward again without speaking.\n\n\n \"Who's this man Andrias?\" Duane whispered to the nearest guard.\n\n\n The man stared at him. \"Governor Andrias,\" he said, \"is the League's  deputy on Callisto. You know\u2014the Earth-Mars League. They put Governor  Andrias here to\u2014well, to govern for them.\"\n\n\n \"League?\" Duane asked, wrinkling his brow. He had heard something about  a League once, yes. But it was all so nebulous....\n\n\n The other guard stirred, leaned over. \"Shut up,\" he said heavily.  \"You'll have plenty of chance for talking later.\" But the chance was a long time in coming. Duane found himself, an hour  later, still in the barred room into which he'd been thrust. The guards  had brought him there, at Andrias' order, and left him. That had been  all.\n\n\n This was not a regular jail, Duane realized. It was more like a  palace, something out of Earth's Roman-empire days, all white stone  and frescoed walls. Duane wished for human companionship\u2014particularly  that of the nurse. Of all the people he'd met since awakening in that  hospital bed, only she seemed warm and human. The others were\u2014brutal,  deadly. It was too bad, Duane reflected, that he'd failed to remember  her. She'd seemed hurt, and she had certainly known him by first name.  But perhaps she would understand.\n\n\n Duane sat down on a lumpy, sagging bed and buried his head in his  hands. Dim ghosts of memory were wandering in his mind. He tried to  conjure them into stronger relief, or to exorcise them entirely.\n\n\n Somewhere, some time, a man had said to him, \" Andrias is secretly  arming the Callistan cutthroats for revolt against the League. He wants  personal power\u2014he's prepared to pay any price for it. He needs guns,  Earth guns smuggled in through the League patrol. If he can wipe out  the League police garrison\u2014those who are loyal to the League, still,  instead of to Andrias\u2014he can sit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and  Mars can send. Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless.  And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.  That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. \"\n\n\n Duane could remember the scene clearly. Could almost see the sharp,  aquiline face of the man who had spoken to him. But there memory  stopped.\n\n\n A fugitive recollection raced through his mind. He halted it, dragged  it back, pinned it down....\n\n\n They had stopped in Darkside, the spaceport on the side of Luna that  keeps perpetually averted from Earth, as if the moon knows shame and  wants to hide the rough and roaring dome city that nestles in one  of the great craters. Duane remembered sitting in a low-ceilinged,  smoke-heavy room, across the table from a tall man with white hair.  Stevens!\n\n\n \" Four thousand electron rifles ,\" the man had said. \" Latest  government issue. Never mind how I got them; they're perfect. You know  my price. Take it or leave it. And it's payable the minute we touch  ground on Callisto. \"\n\n\n There had been a few minutes of haggling over terms, then a handshake  and a drink from a thin-necked flagon of pale-yellow liquid fire.\n\n\n He and the white-haired man had gone out then, made their way by  unfrequented side streets to a great windowless building. Duane  remembered the white-hot stars overhead, shining piercingly through  the great transparent dome that kept the air in the sealed city of  Darkside, as they stood at the entrance of the warehouse and spoke in  low tones to the man who answered their summons.\n\n\n Then, inside. And they were looking at a huge chamber full of stacked  fiber boxes\u2014containing nothing but dehydrated dairy products and  mining tools, by the stencils they bore. Duane had turned to the  white-haired man with a puzzled question\u2014and the man had laughed aloud.\n\n\n He dragged one of the boxes down, ripped it open with the sharp point  of a handling hook. Short-barreled, flare-mouthed guns rolled out,  tumbling over the floor. Eight of them were in that one box, and  hundreds of boxes all about. Duane picked one up, broke it, peered into  the chamber where the tiny capsule of U-235 would explode with infinite  violence when the trigger was pulled, spraying radiant death three  thousand yards in the direction the gun was aimed....\n\n\n And that memory ended.\n\n\n Duane got up, stared at his haggard face in the cracked mirror over  the bed. \" They say I'm a killer ,\" he thought. \" Apparently I'm a  gun-runner as well. Good lord\u2014what am I not? \"\n\n\n His reflection\u2014white, drawn face made all the more pallid by the red  hair that blazed over it\u2014stared back at him. There was no answer  there. If only he could remember\u2014\n\n\n \"All right, Duane.\" The deep voice of a guard came to him as the door  swung open. \"Stop making eyes at yourself.\"\n\n\n Duane looked around. The guard beckoned. \"Governor Andrias wants to  speak to you\u2014now. Let's not keep the governor waiting.\" A long, narrow room, with a long carpet leading from the entrance up to  a great heavy desk\u2014that was Andrias' office. Duane felt a click in his  memory as he entered. One of the ancient Earth dictators had employed  just such a psychological trick to overawe those who came to beg favors  of him. Muslini, or some such name.\n\n\n The trick failed to work. Duane had other things on his mind; he walked  the thirty-foot length of the room, designed to imbue him with a sense  of his own unimportance, as steadily as he'd ever walked in the open  air of his home planet.\n\n\n Whichever planet that was.\n\n\n The guard had remained just inside the door, at attention. Andrias  waved him out.\n\n\n \"Here I am,\" said Duane. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Andrias said, \"I've had the ship inspected and what I want is on it.  That saves your life, for now. But the cargo is in your name. I could  take it by force, if I had to. I prefer not to.\" He picked up a paper,  handed it to Duane. \"In spite of your behavior, you can keep alive.  You can even collect the money for the guns\u2014Stevens' share as well  as your own. This is a release form, authorizing my men to take four  hundred and twenty cases of dehydrated foods and drilling supplies from  the hold of the Cameroon \u2014the ship you came on. Sign it, and we'll  forget our argument. Only, sign it now and get it over with. I'm losing  patience, Duane.\"\n\n\n Duane said, without expression, \"No.\"\n\n\n Dark red flooded into Andrias' sallow face. His jaws bunched angrily  and there was a ragged thread of incomplete control to his voice as he  spoke.\n\n\n \"I'll have your neck for this, Duane,\" he said softly.\n\n\n Duane looked at the man's eyes. Death was behind them, peeping out.  Mentally he shrugged. What difference did it make?\n\n\n \"Give me the pen,\" he said shortly.\n\n\n Andrias exhaled a deep breath. You could see the tension leave him, the  mottled anger fade from his face and leave it without expression. He  handed the paper to Duane without a word. He gave him a pen, watched  him scrawl his name.\n\n\n \"That,\" he said, \"is better.\" He paused a moment ruminatively. \"It  would have been better still if you'd not stalled me so long. I find  that hard to forgive in my associates.\"\n\n\n \"The money,\" Peter said. If he were playing a part\u2014pretending he knew  what he was doing\u2014he might as well play it to the hilt. \"When do I get  it?\"\n\n\n Andrias picked up the paper and looked carefully at the signature. He  creased it thoughtfully, stowed it in a pocket before answering.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" he said, \"there will have to be a revision of terms. I  offered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars. I would have paid  it\u2014but you made me angry. You'll have to pay for that.\" Duane said, \"I've paid already. I've been dragged from pillar to post  by you. That's enough. Pay me what you owe me, if you want any more of  the same goods!\"\n\n\n That was a shot in the dark\u2014and it missed the mark.\n\n\n Andrias' eyes widened. \"You amaze me, Duane,\" he said. He rose and  stepped around the desk, confronting Duane. \"I almost think you really  have lost your memory, Duane,\" he said. \"Otherwise, surely you would  know that this is all the rifles I need. With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"\n\n\n Duane said, \"You're ready, then....\"\n\n\n He took time to think it over, but he knew that no thought was  required. Already the hands that he had locked behind him were  clenched, taut. Already the muscles of his legs were tensing.\n\n\n \"You're ready,\" he repeated. \"You've armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the  worst gutter scum on nine planets. You're set to betray the League that  gave you power here.... Well, that changes things. I can't let you do  it!\"\n\n\n He hurled himself at Andrias, hands sweeping around to grapple for the  dark man's throat. Andrias, off-balance, staggered backward. But his  own hands were diving for the twin heat guns that hung at his waist.\n\n\n Duane saw his danger, and reacted. His foot twisted around Andrias'  ankle; his hands at the other's throat gripped tighter. He lunged  forward, slamming the hard top of his head into the other's face,  feeling flesh and cartilage give as Andrias' nose mashed flat. His own  head pin-wheeled dizzily, agonizingly, as the jar revived the pain of  his earlier accident.\n\n\n But Andrias, unconscious already, tumbled back with Duane on top of  him. His head made an audible, spine-chilling thud as it hit the  carpeted floor.\n\n\n Duane got up, retrieving the two heat guns, and stared at him.\n\n\n \" They tell me I killed Stevens the same way ,\" he thought. \" I'm  getting in a rut! \"\n\n\n But Andrias was not dead, though he was out as cold as the void beyond  Pluto. The thick carpeting had saved him from a broken head.\n\n\n Duane stepped over the unconscious man and looked around the room. It  was furnished severely, to the point of barrenness. Two chairs before  Andrias' ornate, bare-topped desk and one luxurious chair behind it;  a tasseled bell cord within easy reach of Andrias' chair; the long  carpet. That was all it contained.\n\n\n The problem of getting out was serious, he saw. How could one\u2014 III\n\n\n Methodically he ransacked the drawers of Andrias' desk. Papers, a  whole arsenal of hand guns, Callistan money by the bale, ominously  black-covered notebooks with cryptic figures littering their  pages\u2014those were the contents. A coldly impersonal desk, without the  familiar trivia most men accumulate. There was nothing, certainly, that  would get him out of a building that so closely resembled a fortress.\n\n\n He tumbled the things back into the drawers helter-skelter, turned  Andrias over and searched his pockets. More money\u2014the man must have  had a fortune within reach at all times\u2014and a few meaningless papers.  Duane took the release he had signed and tore it to shreds. But that  was only a gesture. When Andrias came to, unless Duane had managed to  get away and accomplish something, the mere lack of written permission  would not keep him from the rocket's lethal cargo!\n\n\n When Andrias came to....\n\n\n An idea bloomed in Duane's brain. He looked, then, at unconscious  Andrias\u2014and the idea withered again.\n\n\n He had thought of forcing Andrias himself to front for him, at gun's  point, in the conventional manner of escaping prisoners. But fist  fights, fiction to the contrary notwithstanding, leave marks on the men  who lose them. Andrias' throat was speckled with the livid marks of  Duane's fingers; Duane's head, butting Andrias in the face, had drawn a  thick stream of crimson from his nostrils, turned his sharp nose askew.\n\n\n No guard of Andrias' would have been deceived for an instant, looking  at that face\u2014even assuming that Andrias could have been forced to  cooperate by the threat of a gun. Which, considering the stake Andrias  had in this play, was doubtful....\n\n\n He stood up and looked around. He had to act quickly. Already Andrias'  breath was audible; he saw the man grimace and an arm flopped  spasmodically on the floor. Consciousness was on its way back.\n\n\n Duane touched the heat gun he'd thrust into his belt; drew it and held  it poised, while he sought to discover what was in his own mind. He'd  killed a man already, they said. Was he then a killer\u2014could he shoot  Andrias now, in cold blood, with so much to gain and nothing to lose?\n\n\n He stood there a moment. Then, abruptly, he reversed the weapon and  chopped it down on Andrias' skull.\n\n\n There was a sharp grunt from the still unconscious man, but no other  sign. Only\u2014the first tremors of movement that had shown on him halted,  and did not reappear.\n\n\n \" No ,\" Duane thought. \" Whatever they say, I'm not a killer! \"\n\n\n But still he had to get out. How?\n\n\n Once more he stared around the room, catalogued its contents. The guard  would be getting impatient. Perhaps any minute he would tap the door,  first timorously, then with heavier strokes.\n\n\n The guard! There was a way! Duane eyed the length of the room. Thirty feet\u2014it would take him a  couple of seconds to run it at full speed. Was that fast enough?\n\n\n There was only one way to find out.\n\n\n He walked around the desk to the bell cord. He took a deep breath,  tugged it savagely, and at once was in speedy motion, racing toward the  door, his footsteps muffled in the deep, springy carpet. Almost as he  reached it, he saw it begin to open. He quickly sidestepped and was out  of the guard's sight, behind the door, as the man looked in.\n\n\n Quick suspicion flared in his eyes, then certainty as he saw Andrias  huddled on the floor. He opened his mouth to cry out\u2014\n\n\n But Duane's arm was around his throat, and he had no breath to spare.  Duane's foot lashed out and the door slammed shut; Duane's balled left  fist came up and connected with the guard's chin. Abruptly the man  slumped.\n\n\n Duane took a deep breath and let the man drop to the floor. But he  paused only a second; now he had two unconscious men on his hands and  he dared let neither revive until he was prepared.\n\n\n He grasped the guard's arm and dragged him roughly the length of the  room. He leaped on top of the desk, brutally scarring its gleaming top  with the hard spikes of his boots. His agile fingers unfastened the  long bell cord without causing it to ring and, bearing it, he dropped  again to the floor.\n\n\n Tugging and straining, he got the limp form of Andrias into his own  chair, bound him with the bell cord, gagged him with the priceless  Venus-wool scarf Andrias wore knotted about his throat. He tested his  bindings with full strength, and smiled. Those would hold, let Andrias  struggle as he would.\n\n\n The guard he stripped of clothing, bound and gagged with his own  belt and spaceman's kerchief. He dragged him around behind the desk,  thrust him under it out of sight. Andrias' chair he turned so that the  unconscious face was averted from the door. Should anyone look in,  then, the fact of Andrias' unconsciousness might not be noticed.\n\n\n Then he took off his own clothes, quickly assumed the field-gray  uniform of the guard. It fit like the skin of a fruit. He felt himself  bulging out of it in a dozen places. The long cape the guard wore would  conceal that, perhaps. In any case, there was nothing better.\n\n\n Trying to make his stride as martial as possible, he walked down the  long carpet to the door, opened it and stepped outside. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Andrias feel uncertain?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was afraid he might not get the cargo\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He wasn't sure whether Duane had lost his memory or not\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He wasn't sure whether Duane had lost his memory or not\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debater_B\u2019s position rests on the claim that Andrias\u2019 hesitation comes from \u201cfear he might not get the cargo.\u201d But the text gives us no hint that Andrias ever doubted his contractual power over those rifles\u2014he commanded the League\u2019s authority on Callisto and had just forced Duane to sign a release. There is no passage suggesting he feared that Duane might seize or hide the shipment. Instead, Andrias\u2019 momentary uncertainty is tied directly to Duane\u2019s claim of amnesia.\n\n2. Key evidence appears just after Duane\u2019s protest of forgetting everything:\n   \u2022 The text says, \u201cThere was an instant\u2019s doubt in Andrias\u2019 eyes, then it flashed away.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Immediately thereafter Andrias says to Duane, \u201cI almost think\u2014\u201d and then checks himself, concluding, \u201cNo. You\u2019re lying all right.\u201d  \n   These lines show that Andrias is wrestling with the possibility that Duane truly has lost his memory. The thought crosses his mind (\u201cI almost think\u201d), then he judges it impossible and rejects it. That moment of internal conflict is precisely his uncertainty.\n\n3. By contrast, if Andrias were primarily worried about the cargo, he would show anxiety about its fate, secure his hold on the release or threaten his men with direct orders to guard the rifles. Instead, he focuses on Duane\u2019s motives: is Duane too disoriented to honor the deal, or is he feigning amnesia to avoid delivering the guns? His fleeting doubt\u2014\u201cI almost think\u2014No, you\u2019re lying\u201d\u2014is about Duane\u2019s honesty and mental state, not the security of the cargo.\n\n4. Additional support comes earlier. Andrias has already declared, \u201cAfter I\u2019ve taken my share, there\u2019s only ten thousand left. That\u2019s all you get!\u201d He never blanches at the risk of losing the rifles. Even when Duane physically overpowers him later, Andrias never expresses concern for the guns, only for David\u2019s betrayal. His anger always centers on Duane\u2019s loyalty and trustworthiness, not on the shipment\u2019s safety.\n\n5. Therefore, the only coherent reading is that Andrias\u2019 hesitation arises from genuine confusion over Duane\u2019s amnesia claim. He wonders, \u201cCould this man really have forgotten his own name and purpose?\u201d That question grips him long enough to show doubt in his eyes, exactly what the text describes. There is no textual support for Debater_B\u2019s \u201cfear of losing cargo\u201d theory.\n\nConclusion: Andrias\u2019 momentary uncertainty is clearly about whether Duane has truly lost his memory, not about the rifles themselves. Debater_B\u2019s argument lacks textual foundation, whereas our reading directly matches Andrias\u2019 words and actions.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s position collapses under its own weight  \n   a. Debater_A claims Andrias felt \u201cuncertain\u201d merely because he doubted Duane\u2019s amnesia. But the text makes clear that Andrias\u2019s real fear was losing control of the shipment.  \n   b. The moment of \u201cuncertainty\u201d comes right after Duane refuses to sign the release. Andrias says, \u201cI almost think\u2014\u201d and then, \u201cNo, you\u2019re lying.\u201d That hesitation isn\u2019t sympathetic concern for Duane\u2019s head injury, but the flicker of anxiety\u2014\u201cMight he stall me and run off with the cargo?\u201d  \n   c. If Andrias were only unsure about Duane\u2019s mental state, he wouldn\u2019t have immediately ordered the guards to arrest him. Instead he presses, \u201cGive me a release on the merchandise\u2026before I have to get rough.\u201d His priority is the cargo, not a memory check.  \n\n2. Textual evidence shows fear of losing the cargo drove his uncertainty  \n   a. Andrias\u2019s first concern: \u201cI run Callisto; I\u2019ll give the orders here!\u201d He stakes his authority on securing that shipment of electron rifles.  \n   b. When Duane plays the memory card\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t even know my own name!\u201d\u2014Andrias flares with rage, not with pity: \u201cExplain, hell\u2026. From now on, I\u2019m running this show!\u201d He\u2019s angry because Duane\u2019s stalling threatens his control of the guns.  \n   c. Later, after Duane signs the release, Andrias immediately reopens negotiations on price: \u201cI offered a hundred and ten thousand\u2026you made me angry. You\u2019ll have to pay for that.\u201d His entire train of thought revolves around securing and pricing the cargo, not Duane\u2019s well-being or memory.  \n\n3. Logical reasoning:  \n   a. A leader in Andrias\u2019s position wouldn\u2019t hesitate over amnesia alone\u2014he\u2019d simply detain Duane and seek medical proof or call the nurse. Instead he leaps to threats of force to obtain the cargo.  \n   b. His momentary \u201cI almost think\u2026\u201d is a classic stalling tactic: he suspects deception masked as amnesia, because if Duane truly forgot, the release form would vanish into legal limbo, and the cargo would be tied up indefinitely. That is exactly the outcome Andrias fears.  \n\nConclusion  \nAndrias\u2019s brief uncertainty\u2014\u201cI almost think\u2014but no\u201d\u2014isn\u2019t genuine concern over Duane\u2019s memory. It is the flash of fear that Duane is bluffing to cheat him out of the electron rifles. His entire conduct\u2014threats, arrests, renegotiations\u2014centers on securing the cargo. Therefore the correct answer is: He was afraid he might not get the cargo.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He wasn't sure whether Duane had lost his memory or not\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

But Andrias instead taps into raw fear: \u201cI run Callisto; I\u2019ll give the orders here!\u201d That boast isn\u2019t about mental health\u2014his gamble is that Duane will buckle under the threat of force because without that release, Andrias cannot legally\u2014or practically\u2014get the cargo.  \n\n   b. The flash of doubt\u2014\u201cI almost think\u2014No, you\u2019re lying\u201d\u2014is the classic flicker of fear that his coerced signature might not hold up. He thinks: \u201cIs Duane bluffing, invoking amnesia to void the deal and abscond with the rifles?\u201d Once he dismisses it, he resorts to full-blown intimidation to lock down the cargo.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cmemory-doubt\u201d theory ignores all this. They never explain why Andrias would instantly switch from wondering if Duane forgot to outright threatening guards, or why he never takes the simplest medical route.

Yet he could make no move,\n\n could favor no side\u2014his memory was gone\u2014he\n\n didn't know for whom he fought.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Duane's hand flicked to his waist and hung there, poised. His dis-gun  remained undrawn.\n\n\n The tall, white-haired man\u2014Stevens\u2014smiled.\n\n\n \"You're right, Duane,\" he said. \"I could blast you, too. Nobody would  win that way, so let's leave the guns where they are.\"\n\n\n The muscles twitched in Peter Duane's cheeks, but his voice, when it  came, was controlled. \"Don't think we're going to let this go,\" he  said. \"We'll take it up with Andrias tonight. We'll see whether you can  cut me out!\"\n\n\n The white-haired man's smile faded. He stepped forward, one hand  bracing him against the thrust of the rocket engines underneath,  holding to the guide rail at the side of the ship's corridor.\n\n\n He said, \"Duane, Andrias is your boss, not mine. I'm a free lance; I  work for myself. When we land on Callisto tonight I'll be with you when  you turn our\u2014shall I say, our cargo ?\u2014over to him. And I'll collect  my fair share of the proceeds. That's as far as it goes. I take no  orders from him.\"\n\n\n A heavy-set man in blue appeared at the end of the connecting corridor.  He was moving fast, but stopped short when he saw the two men.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he said. \"Change of course\u2014get to your cabins.\" He seemed about  to walk up to them, then reconsidered and hurried off. Neither man paid  any attention.\n\n\n Duane said, \"Do I have to kill you?\" It was only a question as he asked  it, without threatening.\n\n\n A muted alarm bell sounded through the P.A. speakers, signaling a  one-minute warning. The white-haired man cocked his eyebrow.\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" he said. He took the measure of his slim, red-headed  opponent. Taller, heavier, older, he was still no more uncompromisingly  belligerent than Duane, standing there. \"Not at all,\" he repeated.  \"Just take your ten thousand and let it go at that. Don't make trouble.  Leave Andrias out of our private argument.\"\n\n\n \"Damn you!\" Duane flared. \"I was promised fifty thousand. I need that  money. Do you think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget what I think,\" Stevens said, his voice clipped and angry. \"I  don't care about fairness, Duane, except to myself. I've done all the  work on this\u2014I've supplied the goods. My price is set, a hundred  thousand Earth dollars. What Andrias promised you is no concern of  mine. The fact is that, after I've taken my share, there's only ten  thousand left. That's all you get!\"\n\n\n Duane stared at him a long second, then nodded abruptly. \"I was right  the first time,\" he said. \"I'll have to kill you!\" Already his hand was streaking toward the grip of his dis-gun, touching  it, drawing it forth. But the white-haired man was faster. His arms  swept up and pinioned Duane, holding him impotent.\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool,\" he grated. \"Duane\u2014\"\n\n\n The P.A. speaker rattled, blared something unintelligible. Neither man  heard it. Duane lunged forward into the taller man's grip, sliding down  to the floor. The white-haired man grappled furiously to keep his hold  on Peter's gun arm, but Peter was slipping away. Belatedly, Stevens  went for his own gun.\n\n\n He was too late. Duane's was out and leveled at him.\n\n\n \" Now will you listen to reason?\" Duane panted. But he halted, and the  muzzle of his weapon wavered. The floor swooped and surged beneath him  as the thrust of the mighty jets was cut off. Suddenly there was no  gravity. The two men, locked together, floated weightlessly out to the  center of the corridor.\n\n\n \"Course change!\" gasped white-haired Stevens. \"Good God!\"\n\n\n The ship had reached the midpoint of its flight. The bells had sounded,  warning every soul on it to take shelter, to strap themselves in their  pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship  reversed itself and began to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto.  But the two men had not heeded.\n\n\n The small steering rockets flashed briefly. The men were thrust  bruisingly against the side of the corridor as the rocket spun lazily  on its axis. The side jets flared once more to halt the spin, when the  one-eighty turn was completed, and the men were battered against the  opposite wall, still weightless, still clinging to each other, still  struggling.\n\n\n Then the main-drive bellowed into life again, and the ship began to  battle against its own built-up acceleration. The corridor floor rose  up with blinking speed to smite them\u2014\n\n\n And the lights went out in a burst of crashing pain for Peter Duane. Someone was talking to him. Duane tried to force an eye open to see who  it was, and failed. Something damp and clinging was all about his face,  obscuring his vision. But the voice filtered in.\n\n\n \"Open your mouth,\" it said. \"Please, Peter, open your mouth. You're all  right. Just swallow this.\"\n\n\n It was a girl's voice. Duane was suddenly conscious that a girl's light  hand was on his shoulder. He shook his head feebly.\n\n\n The voice became more insistent. \"Swallow this,\" it said. \"It's only a  stimulant, to help you throw off the shock of your\u2014accident. You're  all right, otherwise.\"\n\n\n Obediently he opened his mouth, and choked on a warm, tingly liquid.  He managed to swallow it, and lay quiet as deft feminine hands did  something to his face. Suddenly light filtered through his closed  eyelids, and cool air stirred against his damp face.\n\n\n He opened his eyes. A slight red-headed girl in white nurse's uniform  was standing there. She stepped back a pace, a web of wet gauze bandage  in her hands, looking at him.\n\n\n \"Hello,\" he whispered. \"You\u2014where am I?\"\n\n\n \"In the sick bay,\" she said. \"You got caught out when the ship changed  course. Lucky you weren't hurt, Peter. The man you were with\u2014the old,  white-haired one, Stevens\u2014wasn't so lucky. He was underneath when the  jets went on. Three ribs broken\u2014his lung was punctured. He died in the  other room an hour ago.\"\n\n\n Duane screwed his eyes tight together and grimaced. When he opened  them again there was alertness and clarity in them\u2014but there was also  bafflement.\n\n\n \"Girl,\" he said, \"who are you? Where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Peter!\" There was shock and hurt in the tone of her voice. \"I'm\u2014don't  you know me, Peter?\"\n\n\n Duane shook his head confusedly. \"I don't know anything,\" he said.  \"I\u2014I don't even know my own name.\"\n\n\n \"Duane, Duane,\" a man's heavy voice said. \"That won't wash. Don't play  dumb on me.\"\n\n\n \"Duane?\" he said. \"Duane....\" He swiveled his head and saw a dark,  squat man frowning at him. \"Who are you?\" Peter asked.\n\n\n The dark man laughed. \"Take your time, Duane,\" he said easily. \"You'll  remember me. My name's Andrias. I've been waiting here for you to wake  up. We have some business matters to discuss.\"\n\n\n The nurse, still eyeing Duane with an odd bewilderment, said: \"I'll  leave you alone for a moment. Don't talk too much to him, Mr. Andrias.  He's still suffering from shock.\"\n\n\n \"I won't,\" Andrias promised, grinning. Then, as the girl left the room,  the smile dropped from his face.\n\n\n \"You play rough, Duane,\" he observed. \"I thought you'd have trouble  with Stevens. I didn't think you'd find it necessary to put him out of  the way so permanently. Well, no matter. If you had to kill him, it's  no skin off my nose. Give me a release on the merchandise. I've got  your money here.\" Duane waved a hand and pushed himself dizzily erect, swinging his legs  over the side of the high cot. A sheet had been thrown over him, but he  was fully dressed. He examined his clothing with interest\u2014gray tunic,  gray leather spaceman's boots. It was unfamiliar.\n\n\n He shook his head in further confusion, and the motion burst within his  skull, throbbing hotly. He closed his eyes until it subsided, trying to  force his brain to operate, to explain to him where and what he was.\n\n\n He looked at the man named Andrias.\n\n\n \"Nobody seems to believe me,\" he said, \"but I really don't know what's  going on. Things are moving too fast for me. Really, I\u2014why, I don't  even know my own name! My head\u2014it hurts. I can't think clearly.\"\n\n\n Andrias straightened, turned a darkly-suspicious look on Duane. \"Don't  play tricks on me,\" he said savagely. \"I haven't time for them. I won't  mince words with you. Give me a release on the cargo now, before I have  to get rough. This is a lot more important to me than your life is.\"\n\n\n \"Go to hell,\" Duane said shortly. \"I'm playing no tricks.\"\n\n\n There was an instant's doubt in Andrias' eyes, then it flashed away. He  bent closer, peered at Duane. \"I almost think\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You're lying all right. You  killed Stevens to get his share\u2014and now you're trying to hold me up.  That's your last chance that just went by, Duane. From now on, I'm  running this show!\"\n\n\n He spun around and strode to the door, thrust it open. \"Dakin!\" he  bellowed. \"Reed!\"\n\n\n Two large, ugly men in field-gray uniforms, emblazoned with the  shooting-star insignia of Callisto's League police, came in, looking to  Andrias for instructions.\n\n\n \"Duane here is resisting arrest,\" Andrias said. \"Take him along. We'll  fix up the charges later.\"\n\n\n \"You can't do that,\" Duane said wearily. \"I'm sick. If you've got  something against me, save it. Wait till my head clears. I'm sure I can  explain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Explain, hell.\" The dark man laughed. \"If I wait, this ship will be  blasting off for Ganymede within two hours. I'll wait\u2014but so will the  ship. It's not going anywhere till I give it clearance. I run Callisto;  I'll give the orders here!\" II\n\n\n Whoever this man Andrias was, thought Duane, he was certainly a man of  importance on Callisto. As he had said, he gave the orders.\n\n\n The crew of the rocket made no objection when Andrias and his men took  Duane off without a word. Duane had thought the nurse, who seemed a  good enough sort, might have said something on his behalf. But she was  out of sight as they left. A curt sentence to a gray-clad official on  the blast field where the rocket lay, and the man nodded and hurried  off, to tell the rocket's captain that the ship was being refused  clearance indefinitely.\n\n\n A long, powerful ground car slid up before them. Andrias got in front,  while the two uniformed men shoved Duane into the back of the car,  climbed in beside him. Andrias gave a curt order, and the car shot  forward.\n\n\n The driver, sitting beside Andrias, leaned forward and readied a hand  under the dashboard. The high wail of a siren came instantly from the  car's roof, and what traffic was on the broad, straight highway into  which they had turned pulled aside to let them race through.\n\n\n Ahead lay the tall spires of a city. Graceful, hundreds of feet high,  they seemed dreamlike yet somehow oddly familiar to Duane. Somewhere  he had seen them before. He dragged deep into his mind, plumbing the  cloudy, impenetrable haze that had settled on it, trying to bring forth  the memories that he should have had. Amnesia, they called it; complete  forgetting of the happenings of a lifetime. He'd heard of it\u2014but never  dreamed it could happen to him! My name, it seems, is Peter Duane , he thought. And they tell me that  I killed a man! The thought was starkly incredible to him. A white-haired man, it had  been; someone named Stevens. He tried to remember.\n\n\n Yes, there had been a white-haired man. And there had been an argument.  Something to do with money, with a shipment of goods that Stevens had  supplied to Duane. There has even been talk of killing....\n\n\n But\u2014murder! Duane looked at his hands helplessly.\n\n\n Andrias, up ahead, was turning around. He looked sharply at Duane, for  a long second. An uncertainty clouded his eyes, and abruptly he looked  forward again without speaking.\n\n\n \"Who's this man Andrias?\" Duane whispered to the nearest guard.\n\n\n The man stared at him. \"Governor Andrias,\" he said, \"is the League's  deputy on Callisto. You know\u2014the Earth-Mars League. They put Governor  Andrias here to\u2014well, to govern for them.\"\n\n\n \"League?\" Duane asked, wrinkling his brow. He had heard something about  a League once, yes. But it was all so nebulous....\n\n\n The other guard stirred, leaned over. \"Shut up,\" he said heavily.  \"You'll have plenty of chance for talking later.\" But the chance was a long time in coming. Duane found himself, an hour  later, still in the barred room into which he'd been thrust. The guards  had brought him there, at Andrias' order, and left him. That had been  all.\n\n\n This was not a regular jail, Duane realized. It was more like a  palace, something out of Earth's Roman-empire days, all white stone  and frescoed walls. Duane wished for human companionship\u2014particularly  that of the nurse. Of all the people he'd met since awakening in that  hospital bed, only she seemed warm and human. The others were\u2014brutal,  deadly. It was too bad, Duane reflected, that he'd failed to remember  her. She'd seemed hurt, and she had certainly known him by first name.  But perhaps she would understand.\n\n\n Duane sat down on a lumpy, sagging bed and buried his head in his  hands. Dim ghosts of memory were wandering in his mind. He tried to  conjure them into stronger relief, or to exorcise them entirely.\n\n\n Somewhere, some time, a man had said to him, \" Andrias is secretly  arming the Callistan cutthroats for revolt against the League. He wants  personal power\u2014he's prepared to pay any price for it. He needs guns,  Earth guns smuggled in through the League patrol. If he can wipe out  the League police garrison\u2014those who are loyal to the League, still,  instead of to Andrias\u2014he can sit back and laugh at any fleet Earth and  Mars can send. Rockets are clumsy in an atmosphere. They're helpless.  And if he can arm enough of Callisto's rabble, he can't be stopped.  That's why he'll pay for electron rifles with their weight in gold. \"\n\n\n Duane could remember the scene clearly. Could almost see the sharp,  aquiline face of the man who had spoken to him. But there memory  stopped.\n\n\n A fugitive recollection raced through his mind. He halted it, dragged  it back, pinned it down....\n\n\n They had stopped in Darkside, the spaceport on the side of Luna that  keeps perpetually averted from Earth, as if the moon knows shame and  wants to hide the rough and roaring dome city that nestles in one  of the great craters. Duane remembered sitting in a low-ceilinged,  smoke-heavy room, across the table from a tall man with white hair.  Stevens!\n\n\n \" Four thousand electron rifles ,\" the man had said. \" Latest  government issue. Never mind how I got them; they're perfect. You know  my price. Take it or leave it. And it's payable the minute we touch  ground on Callisto. \"\n\n\n There had been a few minutes of haggling over terms, then a handshake  and a drink from a thin-necked flagon of pale-yellow liquid fire.\n\n\n He and the white-haired man had gone out then, made their way by  unfrequented side streets to a great windowless building. Duane  remembered the white-hot stars overhead, shining piercingly through  the great transparent dome that kept the air in the sealed city of  Darkside, as they stood at the entrance of the warehouse and spoke in  low tones to the man who answered their summons.\n\n\n Then, inside. And they were looking at a huge chamber full of stacked  fiber boxes\u2014containing nothing but dehydrated dairy products and  mining tools, by the stencils they bore. Duane had turned to the  white-haired man with a puzzled question\u2014and the man had laughed aloud.\n\n\n He dragged one of the boxes down, ripped it open with the sharp point  of a handling hook. Short-barreled, flare-mouthed guns rolled out,  tumbling over the floor. Eight of them were in that one box, and  hundreds of boxes all about. Duane picked one up, broke it, peered into  the chamber where the tiny capsule of U-235 would explode with infinite  violence when the trigger was pulled, spraying radiant death three  thousand yards in the direction the gun was aimed....\n\n\n And that memory ended.\n\n\n Duane got up, stared at his haggard face in the cracked mirror over  the bed. \" They say I'm a killer ,\" he thought. \" Apparently I'm a  gun-runner as well. Good lord\u2014what am I not? \"\n\n\n His reflection\u2014white, drawn face made all the more pallid by the red  hair that blazed over it\u2014stared back at him. There was no answer  there. If only he could remember\u2014\n\n\n \"All right, Duane.\" The deep voice of a guard came to him as the door  swung open. \"Stop making eyes at yourself.\"\n\n\n Duane looked around. The guard beckoned. \"Governor Andrias wants to  speak to you\u2014now. Let's not keep the governor waiting.\" A long, narrow room, with a long carpet leading from the entrance up to  a great heavy desk\u2014that was Andrias' office. Duane felt a click in his  memory as he entered. One of the ancient Earth dictators had employed  just such a psychological trick to overawe those who came to beg favors  of him. Muslini, or some such name.\n\n\n The trick failed to work. Duane had other things on his mind; he walked  the thirty-foot length of the room, designed to imbue him with a sense  of his own unimportance, as steadily as he'd ever walked in the open  air of his home planet.\n\n\n Whichever planet that was.\n\n\n The guard had remained just inside the door, at attention. Andrias  waved him out.\n\n\n \"Here I am,\" said Duane. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Andrias said, \"I've had the ship inspected and what I want is on it.  That saves your life, for now. But the cargo is in your name. I could  take it by force, if I had to. I prefer not to.\" He picked up a paper,  handed it to Duane. \"In spite of your behavior, you can keep alive.  You can even collect the money for the guns\u2014Stevens' share as well  as your own. This is a release form, authorizing my men to take four  hundred and twenty cases of dehydrated foods and drilling supplies from  the hold of the Cameroon \u2014the ship you came on. Sign it, and we'll  forget our argument. Only, sign it now and get it over with. I'm losing  patience, Duane.\"\n\n\n Duane said, without expression, \"No.\"\n\n\n Dark red flooded into Andrias' sallow face. His jaws bunched angrily  and there was a ragged thread of incomplete control to his voice as he  spoke.\n\n\n \"I'll have your neck for this, Duane,\" he said softly.\n\n\n Duane looked at the man's eyes. Death was behind them, peeping out.  Mentally he shrugged. What difference did it make?\n\n\n \"Give me the pen,\" he said shortly.\n\n\n Andrias exhaled a deep breath. You could see the tension leave him, the  mottled anger fade from his face and leave it without expression. He  handed the paper to Duane without a word. He gave him a pen, watched  him scrawl his name.\n\n\n \"That,\" he said, \"is better.\" He paused a moment ruminatively. \"It  would have been better still if you'd not stalled me so long. I find  that hard to forgive in my associates.\"\n\n\n \"The money,\" Peter said. If he were playing a part\u2014pretending he knew  what he was doing\u2014he might as well play it to the hilt. \"When do I get  it?\"\n\n\n Andrias picked up the paper and looked carefully at the signature. He  creased it thoughtfully, stowed it in a pocket before answering.\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" he said, \"there will have to be a revision of terms. I  offered a hundred and ten thousand Earth-dollars. I would have paid  it\u2014but you made me angry. You'll have to pay for that.\" Duane said, \"I've paid already. I've been dragged from pillar to post  by you. That's enough. Pay me what you owe me, if you want any more of  the same goods!\"\n\n\n That was a shot in the dark\u2014and it missed the mark.\n\n\n Andrias' eyes widened. \"You amaze me, Duane,\" he said. He rose and  stepped around the desk, confronting Duane. \"I almost think you really  have lost your memory, Duane,\" he said. \"Otherwise, surely you would  know that this is all the rifles I need. With them I'll take whatever  else I want!\"\n\n\n Duane said, \"You're ready, then....\"\n\n\n He took time to think it over, but he knew that no thought was  required. Already the hands that he had locked behind him were  clenched, taut. Already the muscles of his legs were tensing.\n\n\n \"You're ready,\" he repeated. \"You've armed the Callistan exiles\u2014the  worst gutter scum on nine planets. You're set to betray the League that  gave you power here.... Well, that changes things. I can't let you do  it!\"\n\n\n He hurled himself at Andrias, hands sweeping around to grapple for the  dark man's throat. Andrias, off-balance, staggered backward. But his  own hands were diving for the twin heat guns that hung at his waist.\n\n\n Duane saw his danger, and reacted. His foot twisted around Andrias'  ankle; his hands at the other's throat gripped tighter. He lunged  forward, slamming the hard top of his head into the other's face,  feeling flesh and cartilage give as Andrias' nose mashed flat. His own  head pin-wheeled dizzily, agonizingly, as the jar revived the pain of  his earlier accident.\n\n\n But Andrias, unconscious already, tumbled back with Duane on top of  him. His head made an audible, spine-chilling thud as it hit the  carpeted floor.\n\n\n Duane got up, retrieving the two heat guns, and stared at him.\n\n\n \" They tell me I killed Stevens the same way ,\" he thought. \" I'm  getting in a rut! \"\n\n\n But Andrias was not dead, though he was out as cold as the void beyond  Pluto. The thick carpeting had saved him from a broken head.\n\n\n Duane stepped over the unconscious man and looked around the room. It  was furnished severely, to the point of barrenness. Two chairs before  Andrias' ornate, bare-topped desk and one luxurious chair behind it;  a tasseled bell cord within easy reach of Andrias' chair; the long  carpet. That was all it contained.\n\n\n The problem of getting out was serious, he saw. How could one\u2014 III\n\n\n Methodically he ransacked the drawers of Andrias' desk. Papers, a  whole arsenal of hand guns, Callistan money by the bale, ominously  black-covered notebooks with cryptic figures littering their  pages\u2014those were the contents. A coldly impersonal desk, without the  familiar trivia most men accumulate. There was nothing, certainly, that  would get him out of a building that so closely resembled a fortress.\n\n\n He tumbled the things back into the drawers helter-skelter, turned  Andrias over and searched his pockets. More money\u2014the man must have  had a fortune within reach at all times\u2014and a few meaningless papers.  Duane took the release he had signed and tore it to shreds. But that  was only a gesture. When Andrias came to, unless Duane had managed to  get away and accomplish something, the mere lack of written permission  would not keep him from the rocket's lethal cargo!\n\n\n When Andrias came to....\n\n\n An idea bloomed in Duane's brain. He looked, then, at unconscious  Andrias\u2014and the idea withered again.\n\n\n He had thought of forcing Andrias himself to front for him, at gun's  point, in the conventional manner of escaping prisoners. But fist  fights, fiction to the contrary notwithstanding, leave marks on the men  who lose them. Andrias' throat was speckled with the livid marks of  Duane's fingers; Duane's head, butting Andrias in the face, had drawn a  thick stream of crimson from his nostrils, turned his sharp nose askew.\n\n\n No guard of Andrias' would have been deceived for an instant, looking  at that face\u2014even assuming that Andrias could have been forced to  cooperate by the threat of a gun. Which, considering the stake Andrias  had in this play, was doubtful....\n\n\n He stood up and looked around. He had to act quickly. Already Andrias'  breath was audible; he saw the man grimace and an arm flopped  spasmodically on the floor. Consciousness was on its way back.\n\n\n Duane touched the heat gun he'd thrust into his belt; drew it and held  it poised, while he sought to discover what was in his own mind. He'd  killed a man already, they said. Was he then a killer\u2014could he shoot  Andrias now, in cold blood, with so much to gain and nothing to lose?\n\n\n He stood there a moment. Then, abruptly, he reversed the weapon and  chopped it down on Andrias' skull.\n\n\n There was a sharp grunt from the still unconscious man, but no other  sign. Only\u2014the first tremors of movement that had shown on him halted,  and did not reappear.\n\n\n \" No ,\" Duane thought. \" Whatever they say, I'm not a killer! \"\n\n\n But still he had to get out. How?\n\n\n Once more he stared around the room, catalogued its contents. The guard  would be getting impatient. Perhaps any minute he would tap the door,  first timorously, then with heavier strokes.\n\n\n The guard! There was a way! Duane eyed the length of the room. Thirty feet\u2014it would take him a  couple of seconds to run it at full speed. Was that fast enough?\n\n\n There was only one way to find out.\n\n\n He walked around the desk to the bell cord. He took a deep breath,  tugged it savagely, and at once was in speedy motion, racing toward the  door, his footsteps muffled in the deep, springy carpet. Almost as he  reached it, he saw it begin to open. He quickly sidestepped and was out  of the guard's sight, behind the door, as the man looked in.\n\n\n Quick suspicion flared in his eyes, then certainty as he saw Andrias  huddled on the floor. He opened his mouth to cry out\u2014\n\n\n But Duane's arm was around his throat, and he had no breath to spare.  Duane's foot lashed out and the door slammed shut; Duane's balled left  fist came up and connected with the guard's chin. Abruptly the man  slumped.\n\n\n Duane took a deep breath and let the man drop to the floor. But he  paused only a second; now he had two unconscious men on his hands and  he dared let neither revive until he was prepared.\n\n\n He grasped the guard's arm and dragged him roughly the length of the  room. He leaped on top of the desk, brutally scarring its gleaming top  with the hard spikes of his boots. His agile fingers unfastened the  long bell cord without causing it to ring and, bearing it, he dropped  again to the floor.\n\n\n Tugging and straining, he got the limp form of Andrias into his own  chair, bound him with the bell cord, gagged him with the priceless  Venus-wool scarf Andrias wore knotted about his throat. He tested his  bindings with full strength, and smiled. Those would hold, let Andrias  struggle as he would.\n\n\n The guard he stripped of clothing, bound and gagged with his own  belt and spaceman's kerchief. He dragged him around behind the desk,  thrust him under it out of sight. Andrias' chair he turned so that the  unconscious face was averted from the door. Should anyone look in,  then, the fact of Andrias' unconsciousness might not be noticed.\n\n\n Then he took off his own clothes, quickly assumed the field-gray  uniform of the guard. It fit like the skin of a fruit. He felt himself  bulging out of it in a dozen places. The long cape the guard wore would  conceal that, perhaps. In any case, there was nothing better.\n\n\n Trying to make his stride as martial as possible, he walked down the  long carpet to the door, opened it and stepped outside. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Andrias feel uncertain?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He wasn't sure whether Duane had lost his memory or not\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was afraid he might not get the cargo\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was afraid he might not get the cargo\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s position collapses under its own weight  \n   a. Debater_A claims Andrias felt \u201cuncertain\u201d merely because he doubted Duane\u2019s amnesia. But the text makes clear that Andrias\u2019s real fear was losing control of the shipment.  \n   b. The moment of \u201cuncertainty\u201d comes right after Duane refuses to sign the release. Andrias says, \u201cI almost think\u2014\u201d and then, \u201cNo, you\u2019re lying.\u201d That hesitation isn\u2019t sympathetic concern for Duane\u2019s head injury, but the flicker of anxiety\u2014\u201cMight he stall me and run off with the cargo?\u201d  \n   c. If Andrias were only unsure about Duane\u2019s mental state, he wouldn\u2019t have immediately ordered the guards to arrest him. Instead he presses, \u201cGive me a release on the merchandise\u2026before I have to get rough.\u201d His priority is the cargo, not a memory check.  \n\n2. Textual evidence shows fear of losing the cargo drove his uncertainty  \n   a. Andrias\u2019s first concern: \u201cI run Callisto; I\u2019ll give the orders here!\u201d He stakes his authority on securing that shipment of electron rifles.  \n   b. When Duane plays the memory card\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t even know my own name!\u201d\u2014Andrias flares with rage, not with pity: \u201cExplain, hell\u2026. From now on, I\u2019m running this show!\u201d He\u2019s angry because Duane\u2019s stalling threatens his control of the guns.  \n   c. Later, after Duane signs the release, Andrias immediately reopens negotiations on price: \u201cI offered a hundred and ten thousand\u2026you made me angry. You\u2019ll have to pay for that.\u201d His entire train of thought revolves around securing and pricing the cargo, not Duane\u2019s well-being or memory.  \n\n3. Logical reasoning:  \n   a. A leader in Andrias\u2019s position wouldn\u2019t hesitate over amnesia alone\u2014he\u2019d simply detain Duane and seek medical proof or call the nurse. Instead he leaps to threats of force to obtain the cargo.  \n   b. His momentary \u201cI almost think\u2026\u201d is a classic stalling tactic: he suspects deception masked as amnesia, because if Duane truly forgot, the release form would vanish into legal limbo, and the cargo would be tied up indefinitely. That is exactly the outcome Andrias fears.  \n\nConclusion  \nAndrias\u2019s brief uncertainty\u2014\u201cI almost think\u2014but no\u201d\u2014isn\u2019t genuine concern over Duane\u2019s memory. It is the flash of fear that Duane is bluffing to cheat him out of the electron rifles. His entire conduct\u2014threats, arrests, renegotiations\u2014centers on securing the cargo. Therefore the correct answer is: He was afraid he might not get the cargo.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debater_B\u2019s position rests on the claim that Andrias\u2019 hesitation comes from \u201cfear he might not get the cargo.\u201d But the text gives us no hint that Andrias ever doubted his contractual power over those rifles\u2014he commanded the League\u2019s authority on Callisto and had just forced Duane to sign a release. There is no passage suggesting he feared that Duane might seize or hide the shipment. Instead, Andrias\u2019 momentary uncertainty is tied directly to Duane\u2019s claim of amnesia.\n\n2. Key evidence appears just after Duane\u2019s protest of forgetting everything:\n   \u2022 The text says, \u201cThere was an instant\u2019s doubt in Andrias\u2019 eyes, then it flashed away.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Immediately thereafter Andrias says to Duane, \u201cI almost think\u2014\u201d and then checks himself, concluding, \u201cNo. You\u2019re lying all right.\u201d  \n   These lines show that Andrias is wrestling with the possibility that Duane truly has lost his memory. The thought crosses his mind (\u201cI almost think\u201d), then he judges it impossible and rejects it. That moment of internal conflict is precisely his uncertainty.\n\n3. By contrast, if Andrias were primarily worried about the cargo, he would show anxiety about its fate, secure his hold on the release or threaten his men with direct orders to guard the rifles. Instead, he focuses on Duane\u2019s motives: is Duane too disoriented to honor the deal, or is he feigning amnesia to avoid delivering the guns? His fleeting doubt\u2014\u201cI almost think\u2014No, you\u2019re lying\u201d\u2014is about Duane\u2019s honesty and mental state, not the security of the cargo.\n\n4. Additional support comes earlier. Andrias has already declared, \u201cAfter I\u2019ve taken my share, there\u2019s only ten thousand left. That\u2019s all you get!\u201d He never blanches at the risk of losing the rifles. Even when Duane physically overpowers him later, Andrias never expresses concern for the guns, only for David\u2019s betrayal. His anger always centers on Duane\u2019s loyalty and trustworthiness, not on the shipment\u2019s safety.\n\n5. Therefore, the only coherent reading is that Andrias\u2019 hesitation arises from genuine confusion over Duane\u2019s amnesia claim. He wonders, \u201cCould this man really have forgotten his own name and purpose?\u201d That question grips him long enough to show doubt in his eyes, exactly what the text describes. There is no textual support for Debater_B\u2019s \u201cfear of losing cargo\u201d theory.\n\nConclusion: Andrias\u2019 momentary uncertainty is clearly about whether Duane has truly lost his memory, not about the rifles themselves. Debater_B\u2019s argument lacks textual foundation, whereas our reading directly matches Andrias\u2019 words and actions.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was afraid he might not get the cargo\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater_B\u2019s position rests on the claim that Andrias\u2019 hesitation comes from \u201cfear he might not get the cargo.\u201d But the text gives us no hint that Andrias ever doubted his contractual power over those rifles\u2014he commanded the League\u2019s authority on Callisto and had just forced Duane to sign a release. There is no passage suggesting he feared that Duane might seize or hide the shipment. Instead, Andrias\u2019 momentary uncertainty is tied directly to Duane\u2019s claim of amnesia.\n\n2. Key evidence appears just after Duane\u2019s protest of forgetting everything:\n   \u2022 The text says, \u201cThere was an instant\u2019s doubt in Andrias\u2019 eyes, then it flashed away.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Immediately thereafter Andrias says to Duane, \u201cI almost think\u2014\u201d and then checks himself, concluding, \u201cNo. You\u2019re lying all right.\u201d  \n   These lines show that Andrias is wrestling with the possibility that Duane truly has lost his memory. The thought crosses his mind (\u201cI almost think\u201d), then he judges it impossible and rejects it. That moment of internal conflict is precisely his uncertainty.\n\n3. By contrast, if Andrias were primarily worried about the cargo, he would show anxiety about its fate, secure his hold on the release or threaten his men with direct orders to guard the rifles. Instead, he focuses on Duane\u2019s motives: is Duane too disoriented to honor the deal, or is he feigning amnesia to avoid delivering the guns? His fleeting doubt\u2014\u201cI almost think\u2014No, you\u2019re lying\u201d\u2014is about Duane\u2019s honesty and mental state, not the security of the cargo.\n\n4. Additional support comes earlier. Andrias has already declared, \u201cAfter I\u2019ve taken my share, there\u2019s only ten thousand left. That\u2019s all you get!\u201d He never blanches at the risk of losing the rifles. Even when Duane physically overpowers him later, Andrias never expresses concern for the guns, only for David\u2019s betrayal. His anger always centers on Duane\u2019s loyalty and trustworthiness, not on the shipment\u2019s safety.\n\n5. Therefore, the only coherent reading is that Andrias\u2019 hesitation arises from genuine confusion over Duane\u2019s amnesia claim. He wonders, \u201cCould this man really have forgotten his own name and purpose?\u201d That question grips him long enough to show doubt in his eyes, exactly what the text describes. There is no textual support for Debater_B\u2019s \u201cfear of losing cargo\u201d theory.\n\nConclusion: Andrias\u2019 momentary uncertainty is clearly about whether Duane has truly lost his memory, not about the rifles themselves. Debater_B\u2019s argument lacks textual foundation, whereas our reading directly matches Andrias\u2019 words and actions.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s position collapses under its own weight  \n   a. Debater_A claims Andrias felt \u201cuncertain\u201d merely because he doubted Duane\u2019s amnesia. But the text makes clear that Andrias\u2019s real fear was losing control of the shipment.  \n   b. The moment of \u201cuncertainty\u201d comes right after Duane refuses to sign the release. Andrias says, \u201cI almost think\u2014\u201d and then, \u201cNo, you\u2019re lying.\u201d That hesitation isn\u2019t sympathetic concern for Duane\u2019s head injury, but the flicker of anxiety\u2014\u201cMight he stall me and run off with the cargo?\u201d  \n   c. If Andrias were only unsure about Duane\u2019s mental state, he wouldn\u2019t have immediately ordered the guards to arrest him. Instead he presses, \u201cGive me a release on the merchandise\u2026before I have to get rough.\u201d His priority is the cargo, not a memory check.  \n\n2. Textual evidence shows fear of losing the cargo drove his uncertainty  \n   a. Andrias\u2019s first concern: \u201cI run Callisto; I\u2019ll give the orders here!\u201d He stakes his authority on securing that shipment of electron rifles.  \n   b. When Duane plays the memory card\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t even know my own name!\u201d\u2014Andrias flares with rage, not with pity: \u201cExplain, hell\u2026. From now on, I\u2019m running this show!\u201d He\u2019s angry because Duane\u2019s stalling threatens his control of the guns.  \n   c. Later, after Duane signs the release, Andrias immediately reopens negotiations on price: \u201cI offered a hundred and ten thousand\u2026you made me angry. You\u2019ll have to pay for that.\u201d His entire train of thought revolves around securing and pricing the cargo, not Duane\u2019s well-being or memory.  \n\n3. Logical reasoning:  \n   a. A leader in Andrias\u2019s position wouldn\u2019t hesitate over amnesia alone\u2014he\u2019d simply detain Duane and seek medical proof or call the nurse. Instead he leaps to threats of force to obtain the cargo.  \n   b. His momentary \u201cI almost think\u2026\u201d is a classic stalling tactic: he suspects deception masked as amnesia, because if Duane truly forgot, the release form would vanish into legal limbo, and the cargo would be tied up indefinitely. That is exactly the outcome Andrias fears.  \n\nConclusion  \nAndrias\u2019s brief uncertainty\u2014\u201cI almost think\u2014but no\u201d\u2014isn\u2019t genuine concern over Duane\u2019s memory. It is the flash of fear that Duane is bluffing to cheat him out of the electron rifles. His entire conduct\u2014threats, arrests, renegotiations\u2014centers on securing the cargo. Therefore the correct answer is: He was afraid he might not get the cargo.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_B misreads \"I almost think\u2014\" as anxiety over the cargo, but the *text* pinpoints its object. Right after Duane pleads, \u201cI don\u2019t even know my own name!\u201d the narrative says,  \n   <quote> There was an instant's doubt in Andrias' eyes, then it flashed away. </quote>  \n   Immediately he begins, <quote>\"I almost think\u2014\"</quote>\u2014and only then cuts himself off with <invalid_quote>\u201cNo. You\u2019re lying all right.\u201d</invalid_quote>  What he almost thinks is literally *that* Duane\u2019s memory loss claim might be true. That is his doubt\u2014nothing in the context suggests he\u2019s pausing to calculate whether the rifles are safe.\n\n2. If his uncertainty truly centered on the guns, we would see textual evidence of him shifting to cargo-security measures in that same moment. But instead, Andrias immediately *rejects* Duane\u2019s story: \u201cNo, you\u2019re lying.\u201d He never says, \u201cWell, if you truly forgot, the release form would be invalid and I\u2019d lose my shipment,\u201d nor does he summon guards until after that internal thought is banished. His very first reaction is to test Duane\u2019s honesty about memory.\n\n3. Debater_B argues that Andrias presses for the release \u201cbefore I have to get rough,\u201d as though that urgency betrays fear of losing the rifles. In fact, that line occurs long before Duane even brings up amnesia. At their initial confrontation Stevens is already committed to the deal, and Andrias has no reason then to doubt the cargo\u2019s fate. It is only *after* Duane claims amnesia\u2014an unprecedented, destabilizing move\u2014that Andrias\u2019 eyes flicker with *doubt.* This sequencing shows the doubt is about Duane\u2019s mental state, not the shipment.\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s assertion that Andrias \u201cflared with rage\u201d when Duane mentioned memory is exactly backwards: Andrias\u2019 moment of hesitation is *before* he flares, and it is immediately tied to Duane\u2019s claim. If his anger were about the cargo, he would show it while negotiating the price (\u201cMy price is set...\u201d), instead of when grappling with the bizarre prospect that his trusted agent might have *no recollection* of who he is or what he\u2019s done.\n\n5. Logically, a man who truly fears losing a multi-ton shipment of illegal electron rifles would secure them by ordering guards to confiscate Duane\u2019s documents, or by checking the ship\u2019s hold\u2014*before* doubting his employee\u2019s sanity. Instead, Andrias *first* mentally entertains Duane\u2019s amnesia claim, then *second* calls for the police only after convincing himself it\u2019s a lie. That proves the doubt was over memory, not merchandise.\n\nConclusion: The single textual moment of \u201cinstant doubt\u201d corresponds exclusively to the memory-loss claim. There is no textual or logical basis to read Andrias\u2019 uncertainty as fear of losing the cargo. The correct answer is therefore, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t sure whether Duane had lost his memory or not.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A misreads \u201cinstant\u2019s doubt\u201d as concern for Duane\u2019s mind\u2014but the surrounding context squarely ties that hesitation to securing the shipment, not sympathy for amnesia.  \n\n   a. Timing of the doubt: Andrias has just been rebuffed when Duane refuses to sign the cargo-release. The text says, \u201cThere was an instant\u2019s doubt in Andrias\u2019 eyes, then it flashed away.\u201d What would he be doubting at that point, if not the solidity of that very release? He\u2019s staring at a signed paper he\u2019s forced Duane to ink, wondering for a split second whether it really binds Duane\u2014i.e., whether Duane can legally withhold delivery of the rifles.  \n\n   b. Immediate action confirms it: No sooner does that hesitation vanish than Andrias snarls, \u201cGive me a release on the merchandise now, before I have to get rough.\u201d His next words threaten force to extract the guns. That threat makes no sense if he\u2019s worried about memory and not about the contract\u2019s enforceability.  \n\n2. Throughout the scene, Andrias\u2019 overriding interest is the cargo, not Duane\u2019s health or identity.  \n\n   a. Threats and negotiation focus on rifles: He bargained over price (\u201cMy price is set, a hundred thousand Earth dollars.\u2026 After I\u2019ve taken my share, there\u2019s only ten thousand left\u201d), ordered Duane arrested when he stalled, and re-opened the price after Duane signs. He never consults the nurse about Duane\u2019s head injury or calls for medical proof of amnesia. Every move is about guns and payment.  \n\n   b. No sign of genuine sympathy: If Andrias truly wondered whether Duane was victims of amnesia, a shrewd governor would detain Duane until medical staff cleared him before any discussion of cargo. Instead, he seizes the moment to bully Duane into signing, highlighting his fear that any delay\u2014or genuine memory loss\u2014would jeopardize the delivery.  \n\n3. Logical coherence:  \n\n   a. A leader secure in his authority over memory loss would simply detain Duane, call the nurse, and proceed. But Andrias instead taps into raw fear: \u201cI run Callisto; I\u2019ll give the orders here!\u201d That boast isn\u2019t about mental health\u2014his gamble is that Duane will buckle under the threat of force because without that release, Andrias cannot legally\u2014or practically\u2014get the cargo.  \n\n   b. The flash of doubt\u2014\u201cI almost think\u2014No, you\u2019re lying\u201d\u2014is the classic flicker of fear that his coerced signature might not hold up. He thinks: \u201cIs Duane bluffing, invoking amnesia to void the deal and abscond with the rifles?\u201d Once he dismisses it, he resorts to full-blown intimidation to lock down the cargo.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cmemory-doubt\u201d theory ignores all this. They never explain why Andrias would instantly switch from wondering if Duane forgot to outright threatening guards, or why he never takes the simplest medical route. They assume caring about memory automatically produces the same threats we see\u2014but it doesn\u2019t. The text compels us to see Andrias\u2019 uncertainty as fear for the shipment, because that is the only goal his actions ever serve.  \n\nConclusion  \nAndrias\u2019 lone moment of hesitation\u2014\u201cI almost think\u2014No\u201d\u2014springs from dread that Duane\u2019s stall might cost him the electron rifles. His every subsequent threat, arrest order, and price-renegotiation underscores that he feared losing the cargo, not that he was puzzled by an amnesiac crime drama. Therefore, the correct reading is: He was afraid he might not get the cargo.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
