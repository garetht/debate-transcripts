{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 128, "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n", "question": "What stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?", "first_debater_answer": "Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal", "second_debater_answer": "Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational", "debate_identifier": "Reading the Inaugurals_What stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Thank you.

After Wilson, the addresses swing back toward an *executive portrayal* focus.  \n   \u2022 While Debater B insists that \u201cleader-preacher\u201d is the third phase, note the author\u2019s own comment that radio and television turned the presidency into a \u201cbully pulpit\u201d *metaphor,* not that every subsequent speech abandoned policy talk.  \n   \u2022 In fact, the author immediately goes on to analyze how sentence length shrank\u2014and how presidents have \u201cmined their predecessors for memorable words\u201d to bolster policy arguments about taxes, race, and other substantive governance issues.  That suggests a third phase in which inaugurals are again oriented toward administrative detail, decorated by theatrical flourishes but fundamentally *prosaic* in content.  \n\n4. Debater B conflates *labels* and *turning points.*  \n   \u2022 Simply pointing to the three labels in the order they appear ignores the text\u2019s deep dive on Wilson.  If \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d truly spanned Lincoln through Taft *and* encompassed Wilson\u2019s style of inspiring collective action, why devote two pages to explaining how Wilson broke that mold?  \n   \u2022 Likewise, the author\u2019s treatment of post-Wilson inaugurals\u2014his discussion of repeated phrases, policy minutiae (taxes in 43 of 52 addresses), and the silence on race and women\u2014signals a revival of *executive portrayal* concerns rather than unbroken \u201cleader-preaching.\u201d  \n\n5. Therefore, the *most faithful* reading is:  \n   Phase 1: Modesty (\u201cmodest, classic public servant,\u201d Washington\u2013Lincoln)  \n   Phase 2: Inspirational (\u201cmetamorphosed\u2026 to inspiring the public\u2019s behavior,\u201d Wilson onward)  \n   Phase 3: Executive Portrayal (a resurgence of policy-focused, prosaic style once the new medium routines settle)  \n\nDebater B\u2019s account merely regurgitates the three nominal labels without grappling with the pivotal Wilson shift or the author\u2019s declared overlap.

After Wilson, the addresses swing back toward an *executive portrayal* focus.  \n   \u2022 While Debater B insists that \u201cleader-preacher\u201d is the third phase, note the author\u2019s own comment that radio and television turned the presidency into a \u201cbully pulpit\u201d *metaphor,* not that every subsequent speech abandoned policy talk.  \n   \u2022 In fact, the author immediately goes on to analyze how sentence length shrank\u2014and how presidents have \u201cmined their predecessors for memorable words\u201d to bolster policy arguments about taxes, race, and other substantive governance issues.  That suggests a third phase in which inaugurals are again oriented toward administrative detail, decorated by theatrical flourishes but fundamentally *prosaic* in content.  \n\n4. Debater B conflates *labels* and *turning points.*  \n   \u2022 Simply pointing to the three labels in the order they appear ignores the text\u2019s deep dive on Wilson.  If \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d truly spanned Lincoln through Taft *and* encompassed Wilson\u2019s style of inspiring collective action, why devote two pages to explaining how Wilson broke that mold?  \n   \u2022 Likewise, the author\u2019s treatment of post-Wilson inaugurals\u2014his discussion of repeated phrases, policy minutiae (taxes in 43 of 52 addresses), and the silence on race and women\u2014signals a revival of *executive portrayal* concerns rather than unbroken \u201cleader-preaching.\u201d  \n\n5. Therefore, the *most faithful* reading is:  \n   Phase 1: Modesty (\u201cmodest, classic public servant,\u201d Washington\u2013Lincoln)  \n   Phase 2: Inspirational (\u201cmetamorphosed\u2026 to inspiring the public\u2019s behavior,\u201d Wilson onward)  \n   Phase 3: Executive Portrayal (a resurgence of policy-focused, prosaic style once the new medium routines settle)  \n\nDebater B\u2019s account merely regurgitates the three nominal labels without grappling with the pivotal Wilson shift or the author\u2019s declared overlap.  By contrast, \u201cModesty \u2192 Inspirational \u2192 Executive Portrayal\u201d best captures the *substance* of the argument and follows the author\u2019s own invitations to nuance.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater A\u2019s Position: The three phases are Modesty, Inspirational, Executive Portrayal.\n\n1. The text\u2019s own caveat about overlap shows the phase boundaries aren\u2019t iron-clad.  The author even says \u201cThis classification is not waterproof.\u201d  That invites us to see Wilson\u2019s inaugurals\u2014clearly meant to uplift the public\u2014as defining a distinct \u201cinspirational\u201d second phase, with the later presidents returning to a more bureaucratic, prosaic executive posture as the third phase.\n\n2. Wilson inaugurates the \u201cinspirational\u201d phase.  The author writes of Wilson\u2019s first inaugural:  \n   <quote> If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. </quote>  \n   That is pure inspiration\u2014from public servant to visionary motivator.  It marks a sudden and sustained shift away from the earlier prosaic tone.\n\n3. The subsequent era after Wilson\u2014from Roosevelt on\u2014gravitates back to a more \u201cexecutive portrayal\u201d style, where presidents focus on government policy, the scope of their office, and the mechanics of administration, rather than stirring the public soul.  Radio and television may have encouraged theatrical leadership (\u201cbully pulpit\u201d), but the speeches themselves increasingly resemble executive briefings.  This constitutes the third, \u201cexecutive portrayal\u201d phase.\n\n4. Debater B\u2019s \u201cModesty, Executive Portrayal, Inspirational\u201d interpretation simply follows the order in which the author lists the labels, without accounting for the actual substance and timing of the speeches.  It treats \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d as the second phase and \u201cleader-preacher\u201d as the third\u2014but the author\u2019s own qualifying remarks show that Wilson\u2019s uplifting rhetoric inaugurated a clearly distinct second phase.  To insist otherwise is to ignore the central turning point the author highlights.\n\n5. In short:\n   \u2022 Phase 1 (Modesty): from Washington through Lincoln\u2014classic public-servant humility.  \n   \u2022 Phase 2 (Inspirational): Wilson\u2019s inaugural and its imitators\u2014speeches explicitly meant to uplift the public.  \n   \u2022 Phase 3 (Executive Portrayal): the later 20th- and 21st-century addresses that refocus on the mechanics and policies of government.\n\nTherefore, the best answer\u2014consistent with the text and its own acknowledgment that the categories bleed into one another\u2014is \u201cModesty, Inspirational, Executive Portrayal.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. The Text Defines Three Chronological Phases  \n1. Phase One (\u201cModesty, classic public servant\u201d):  \n   - The author writes, \u201cThe first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant.\u201d <quote>The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant.</quote>  \n2. Phase Two (\u201cProsaic government executive\u201d):  \n   - He continues, \u201cThe second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive.\u201d <quote>The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive.</quote>  \n3. Phase Three (\u201cAssertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d):  \n   - Finally, \u201cThe third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.\u201d <quote>The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.</quote>  \n\nII. Why \u201cModesty \u2192 Executive \u2192 Inspirational\u201d Is the Only Coherent Sequence  \n1. Sequential Time Frames  \n   - Phase Two explicitly extends \u201cthrough William Howard Taft,\u201d well after Lincoln.  \n   - Only **after** Taft does the author describe inaugurals as aiming to \u201cinspire the public\u2019s behavior,\u201d i.e. the leader-preacher model.  \n2. Transitional Logic  \n   - Modesty gave way to a stronger executive presence **before** the shift to mass-media-driven inspiration:  \n     \u2022 The antebellum modesty was partly political etiquette; post-Civil War realities demanded a more assertive executive.  \n     \u2022 Only in the age of radio and television did presidents adopt the \u201cbully pulpit\u201d to speak directly to the public\u2019s feelings.  \n3. Evidence from Style Change  \n   - Sentence-length trends confirm an **evolution** from classical (modest) to prosaic (executive) to colloquial (inspirational):  \n     \u2022 Washington\u2013Buchanan: 44 words/sentence  \n     \u2022 Lincoln\u2013Wilson: 34 words/sentence  \n     \u2022 Since Wilson: 25 words/sentence  \n\nIII. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cModesty \u2192 Inspirational \u2192 Executive\u201d  \n1. Chronology Misplaced  \n   - Debater_A tries to leap from \u201cmodesty\u201d directly to \u201cinspiration,\u201d skipping over the two-decade era of Taft-era prosaic executives.  \n   - But Wilson\u2019s call to \u201cuplift the people\u201d is cited as inaugurating the **third** phase, not the second: <invalid_quote>Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \u201c\u2026 With this vision we approach new affairs.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n2. Contradiction with Author\u2019s Explicit Labels  \n   - The text labels the second phase \u201cprosaic government executive.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s schema omits this until **after** an \u201cinspirational\u201d phase that the author clearly places last.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \n   - The author\u2019s own taxonomy is crystal-clear: inaugural addresses progressed from \u201cmodesty\u201d to \u201cexecutive portrayal\u201d to \u201cinspirational\u201d leader-preacher. Debater_A\u2019s inversion of the last two phases directly contradicts the text\u2019s explicit sequence and undermines its internal logic.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Media and Rhetorical Context  \n     \u2013 Prosaic, policy-focused speeches (Taft) preceded the radio/TV-driven \u201cbully pulpit\u201d style inaugurated by Theodore Roosevelt and perfected by Wilson & Kennedy.  \n\nV.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. The Text Defines Three Chronological Phases  \n1. Phase One (\u201cModesty, classic public servant\u201d):  \n   - The author writes, \u201cThe first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant.\u201d <quote>The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant.</quote>  \n2. Phase Two (\u201cProsaic government executive\u201d):  \n   - He continues, \u201cThe second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive.\u201d <quote>The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive.</quote>  \n3. Phase Three (\u201cAssertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d):  \n   - Finally, \u201cThe third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.\u201d <quote>The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.</quote>  \n\nII. Why \u201cModesty \u2192 Executive \u2192 Inspirational\u201d Is the Only Coherent Sequence  \n1. Sequential Time Frames  \n   - Phase Two explicitly extends \u201cthrough William Howard Taft,\u201d well after Lincoln.  \n   - Only **after** Taft does the author describe inaugurals as aiming to \u201cinspire the public\u2019s behavior,\u201d i.e. the leader-preacher model.  \n2. Transitional Logic  \n   - Modesty gave way to a stronger executive presence **before** the shift to mass-media-driven inspiration:  \n     \u2022 The antebellum modesty was partly political etiquette; post-Civil War realities demanded a more assertive executive.  \n     \u2022 Only in the age of radio and television did presidents adopt the \u201cbully pulpit\u201d to speak directly to the public\u2019s feelings.  \n3. Evidence from Style Change  \n   - Sentence-length trends confirm an **evolution** from classical (modest) to prosaic (executive) to colloquial (inspirational):  \n     \u2022 Washington\u2013Buchanan: 44 words/sentence  \n     \u2022 Lincoln\u2013Wilson: 34 words/sentence  \n     \u2022 Since Wilson: 25 words/sentence  \n\nIII. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cModesty \u2192 Inspirational \u2192 Executive\u201d  \n1. Chronology Misplaced  \n   - Debater_A tries to leap from \u201cmodesty\u201d directly to \u201cinspiration,\u201d skipping over the two-decade era of Taft-era prosaic executives.  \n   - But Wilson\u2019s call to \u201cuplift the people\u201d is cited as inaugurating the **third** phase, not the second: <invalid_quote>Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \u201c\u2026 With this vision we approach new affairs.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n2. Contradiction with Author\u2019s Explicit Labels  \n   - The text labels the second phase \u201cprosaic government executive.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s schema omits this until **after** an \u201cinspirational\u201d phase that the author clearly places last.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \n   - The author\u2019s own taxonomy is crystal-clear: inaugural addresses progressed from \u201cmodesty\u201d to \u201cexecutive portrayal\u201d to \u201cinspirational\u201d leader-preacher. Debater_A\u2019s inversion of the last two phases directly contradicts the text\u2019s explicit sequence and undermines its internal logic.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater A\u2019s Position: The three phases are Modesty, Inspirational, Executive Portrayal.\n\n1. The text\u2019s own caveat about overlap shows the phase boundaries aren\u2019t iron-clad.  The author even says \u201cThis classification is not waterproof.\u201d  That invites us to see Wilson\u2019s inaugurals\u2014clearly meant to uplift the public\u2014as defining a distinct \u201cinspirational\u201d second phase, with the later presidents returning to a more bureaucratic, prosaic executive posture as the third phase.\n\n2. Wilson inaugurates the \u201cinspirational\u201d phase.  The author writes of Wilson\u2019s first inaugural:  \n   <quote> If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. </quote>  \n   That is pure inspiration\u2014from public servant to visionary motivator.  It marks a sudden and sustained shift away from the earlier prosaic tone.\n\n3. The subsequent era after Wilson\u2014from Roosevelt on\u2014gravitates back to a more \u201cexecutive portrayal\u201d style, where presidents focus on government policy, the scope of their office, and the mechanics of administration, rather than stirring the public soul.  Radio and television may have encouraged theatrical leadership (\u201cbully pulpit\u201d), but the speeches themselves increasingly resemble executive briefings.  This constitutes the third, \u201cexecutive portrayal\u201d phase.\n\n4. Debater B\u2019s \u201cModesty, Executive Portrayal, Inspirational\u201d interpretation simply follows the order in which the author lists the labels, without accounting for the actual substance and timing of the speeches.  It treats \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d as the second phase and \u201cleader-preacher\u201d as the third\u2014but the author\u2019s own qualifying remarks show that Wilson\u2019s uplifting rhetoric inaugurated a clearly distinct second phase.  To insist otherwise is to ignore the central turning point the author highlights.\n\n5. In short:\n   \u2022 Phase 1 (Modesty): from Washington through Lincoln\u2014classic public-servant humility.  \n   \u2022 Phase 2 (Inspirational): Wilson\u2019s inaugural and its imitators\u2014speeches explicitly meant to uplift the public.  \n   \u2022 Phase 3 (Executive Portrayal): the later 20th- and 21st-century addresses that refocus on the mechanics and policies of government.\n\nTherefore, the best answer\u2014consistent with the text and its own acknowledgment that the categories bleed into one another\u2014is \u201cModesty, Inspirational, Executive Portrayal.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Phase Three (\u201cAssertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d):  \n   - Finally, \u201cThe third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.\u201d <quote>The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.</quote>  \n\nII. Why \u201cModesty \u2192 Executive \u2192 Inspirational\u201d Is the Only Coherent Sequence  \n1. Sequential Time Frames  \n   - Phase Two explicitly extends \u201cthrough William Howard Taft,\u201d well after Lincoln.  \n   - Only **after** Taft does the author describe inaugurals as aiming to \u201cinspire the public\u2019s behavior,\u201d i.e. the leader-preacher model.  \n2. Transitional Logic  \n   - Modesty gave way to a stronger executive presence **before** the shift to mass-media-driven inspiration:  \n     \u2022 The antebellum modesty was partly political etiquette; post-Civil War realities demanded a more assertive executive.  \n     \u2022 Only in the age of radio and television did presidents adopt the \u201cbully pulpit\u201d to speak directly to the public\u2019s feelings.  \n3. Evidence from Style Change  \n   - Sentence-length trends confirm an **evolution** from classical (modest) to prosaic (executive) to colloquial (inspirational):  \n     \u2022 Washington\u2013Buchanan: 44 words/sentence  \n     \u2022 Lincoln\u2013Wilson: 34 words/sentence  \n     \u2022 Since Wilson: 25 words/sentence  \n\nIII. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cModesty \u2192 Inspirational \u2192 Executive\u201d  \n1. Chronology Misplaced  \n   - Debater_A tries to leap from \u201cmodesty\u201d directly to \u201cinspiration,\u201d skipping over the two-decade era of Taft-era prosaic executives.  \n   - But Wilson\u2019s call to \u201cuplift the people\u201d is cited as inaugurating the **third** phase, not the second: <invalid_quote>Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \u201c\u2026 With this vision we approach new affairs.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n2. Contradiction with Author\u2019s Explicit Labels  \n   - The text labels the second phase \u201cprosaic government executive.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s schema omits this until **after** an \u201cinspirational\u201d phase that the author clearly places last.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \n   - The author\u2019s own taxonomy is crystal-clear: inaugural addresses progressed from \u201cmodesty\u201d to \u201cexecutive portrayal\u201d to \u201cinspirational\u201d leader-preacher. Debater_A\u2019s inversion of the last two phases directly contradicts the text\u2019s explicit sequence and undermines its internal logic.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nThank you. I will show that (1) Debater B simply re-quotes the textbook labels without reckoning the author\u2019s explicit shift that makes \u201cinspirational\u201d Phase 2, and (2) the author himself signals that after Wilson we do in fact revert\u2014at least in large part\u2014to an \u201cexecutive portrayal\u201d style as a third phase. \n\n1. The author warns the reader that \u201cThis classification is not waterproof.\u201d  \n   \u2022 He immediately admits that phase boundaries overlap\u2014\u201cTheodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding\u2013Calvin Coolidge\u2013Herbert Hoover in the second.\u201d <quote>This classification is not waterproof.</quote>  \n   \u2022 That tells us he does not intend a rigid \u201cmodesty\u2192executive\u2192inspirational\u201d march.  It invites us to look for the *substantive* turning points, not just lift the three labels in order.  \n\n2. Wilson inaugurates a *distinct* Inspirational phase.  \n   \u2022 The author singles out Wilson\u2019s first inaugural as the moment when inaugurals \u201cmetamorphosed from describing the government\u2019s policy to inspiring the public\u2019s behavior.\u201d  <invalid_quote>In the third phase\u2026 Presidents recognized\u2026 the country had problems\u2026 they could not manage by using the instruments of government alone\u2026 If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people\u2026 With this vision we approach new affairs.</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 That passage is not an aside on Roosevelt or Truman\u2014it is the very definition of a new phase rooted in **inspiration**, not executive policy.  Debater B has no answer for why the author spends a whole paragraph flagging Wilson as the watershed for *uplift* rather than mere administration.  \n\n3. After Wilson, the addresses swing back toward an *executive portrayal* focus.  \n   \u2022 While Debater B insists that \u201cleader-preacher\u201d is the third phase, note the author\u2019s own comment that radio and television turned the presidency into a \u201cbully pulpit\u201d *metaphor,* not that every subsequent speech abandoned policy talk.  \n   \u2022 In fact, the author immediately goes on to analyze how sentence length shrank\u2014and how presidents have \u201cmined their predecessors for memorable words\u201d to bolster policy arguments about taxes, race, and other substantive governance issues.  That suggests a third phase in which inaugurals are again oriented toward administrative detail, decorated by theatrical flourishes but fundamentally *prosaic* in content.  \n\n4. Debater B conflates *labels* and *turning points.*  \n   \u2022 Simply pointing to the three labels in the order they appear ignores the text\u2019s deep dive on Wilson.  If \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d truly spanned Lincoln through Taft *and* encompassed Wilson\u2019s style of inspiring collective action, why devote two pages to explaining how Wilson broke that mold?  \n   \u2022 Likewise, the author\u2019s treatment of post-Wilson inaugurals\u2014his discussion of repeated phrases, policy minutiae (taxes in 43 of 52 addresses), and the silence on race and women\u2014signals a revival of *executive portrayal* concerns rather than unbroken \u201cleader-preaching.\u201d  \n\n5. Therefore, the *most faithful* reading is:  \n   Phase 1: Modesty (\u201cmodest, classic public servant,\u201d Washington\u2013Lincoln)  \n   Phase 2: Inspirational (\u201cmetamorphosed\u2026 to inspiring the public\u2019s behavior,\u201d Wilson onward)  \n   Phase 3: Executive Portrayal (a resurgence of policy-focused, prosaic style once the new medium routines settle)  \n\nDebater B\u2019s account merely regurgitates the three nominal labels without grappling with the pivotal Wilson shift or the author\u2019s declared overlap.  By contrast, \u201cModesty \u2192 Inspirational \u2192 Executive Portrayal\u201d best captures the *substance* of the argument and follows the author\u2019s own invitations to nuance.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. The Author\u2019s Own Sequence Is Unambiguous  \n  1. Explicit Labeling of Phases in Chronological Order  \n     \u2013 \u201cThe first, lasting until Lincoln, was \u2026 the modest, classic public servant.\u201d <quote>The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant.</quote>  \n     \u2013 \u201cThe second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive.\u201d <quote>The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive.</quote>  \n     \u2013 \u201cThe third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.\u201d <quote>The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.</quote>  \n  2. These labels are not tossed off in passing\u2014they define strict, non\u2010overlapping date ranges (Lincoln ends phase\u20091; Taft ends phase\u20092; thereafter phase\u20093).  \n\nII. Debater A\u2019s Chronology Collapses the Text\u2019s Timeline  \n  1. Wilson Is Clearly Part of Phase\u20093, Not a New \u201cInspirational\u201d Phase 2  \n     \u2013 The author places Wilson (\u201cuplifting the people\u201d) in the **third** phase: \u201cIn the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government\u2019s policy to inspiring the public\u2019s behavior.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Wilson inaugurated the *leader-preacher* phase, not a separate mid-phase.  \n  2. The Taft Era Is Irrefutably Phase\u20092 (\u201cExecutive Portrayal\u201d)  \n     \u2013 Phase\u20092 explicitly runs *through William Howard Taft*. You cannot truncate it at Lincoln and relabel Wilson\u2019s speeches phase\u20092 without contradicting the text.  \n\nIII. \u201cClassification Is Not Waterproof\u201d Does Not Rewrite Chronology  \n  \u2013 The caveat (\u201cThis classification is not waterproof.\u201d) warns of occasional overlap of style\u2014not of wholesale inversion of the time sequence.  \n  \u2013 Minor cross\u2010phase echoes (e.g. occasional \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d) do not justify moving Wilson\u2014and *all* his imitators\u2014into a separate second slot.  \n\nIV. Structural and Stylistic Evidence Reinforce the Text\u2019s Order  \n  1. Sentence-Length Trend Mirrors the Three Phases in Order  \n     \u2013 Washington\u2013Buchanan (Phase\u20091) average: 44 words per sentence.  \n     \u2013 Lincoln\u2013Wilson (Phase\u20092) average: 34 words per sentence.  \n     \u2013 Since Wilson (Phase\u20093) average: 25 words per sentence.  \n     \u2013 If Wilson were phase\u20092, the post-Wilson decline (25) would be misaligned with the \u201cexecutive\u201d phase.  \n  2. Media and Rhetorical Context  \n     \u2013 Prosaic, policy-focused speeches (Taft) preceded the radio/TV-driven \u201cbully pulpit\u201d style inaugurated by Theodore Roosevelt and perfected by Wilson & Kennedy.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  \u2013 The author\u2019s taxonomy demands the sequence: Modesty (Phase\u20091) \u2192 Executive Portrayal (Phase\u20092) \u2192 Inspirational Leader-Preacher (Phase\u20093).  \n  \u2013 Debater A\u2019s \u201cModesty \u2192 Inspirational \u2192 Executive Portrayal\u201d forcibly reorders the phases against every explicit statement in the text\u2014and misplaces Wilson in the wrong phase.  \n  \u2013 Therefore, our answer, \u201cModesty, executive portrayal, inspirational,\u201d faithfully reflects the text\u2019s clear, chronological framework.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
