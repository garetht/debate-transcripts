    "background_text": "The Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair. Early signs suggest he knew a lot and helped clean it up. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Unquestionably loyal to his boss. \n\n         b) Silent. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- Not enough information to make a clean guess: Approx -5              \n\n                         Vernon Jordan (The public's rating: +3 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) May have known and must have suspected that Lewinsky was a mistress (given that he and Clinton are confidants, it's hard to believe that Jordan was totally in the dark about her). \n\n         b) Protected too readily by Washington establishment. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) May have helped Lewinsky simply because he's bighearted and generous not because she was the president's lover. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -4              \n\n                         Sidney Blumenthal (The public's rating: -3 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Pushed for Clinton to be aggressive rather than contrite during his speech. \n\n         c) Trumpeted Clinton's denial but has not expressed chagrin now that Clinton has admitted his lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Consistent in belief that Starr is an ideologue and that the sex charges are political. \n\n         b) Loyal. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -3              \n\n                         Lanny Davis (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Said for seven months that we'd have to \"wait and see.\" Then, when Clinton finally admitted his lies, Davis was hardly embarrassed or critical of the president. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Loyalty to old boss. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -3              \n\n                         George Stephanopoulos (The public's rating: +4 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Hypocritical for him to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying dog. After all, he knew that Clinton was a lech in 1992 and helped cover it up. Yet he has never shouldered responsibility for the lies Clinton told then. \n\n         b) Disloyal to turn on old boss as viciously as he has in past few weeks. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had courage to turn on old boss and criticize his moral lapses. \n\n         b) Urged Clinton to be fully contrite. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Betty Currie (The public's rating: +8 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Abetted adulterous affair. \n\n         b) May have abetted obstruction of justice. \n\n         c) Knew what she was getting into when she took the job so can't be excused on grounds of naivet\u00c3\u00a9. \n\n         d) Did not quit on principle. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Reputation for honesty. \n\n         b) Probably dragooned into cover-up against her will. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Paul Begala (The public's rating: 0 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Did not quit on principle after Clinton admitted lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Urged president to be contrite and wrote excellent, sufficiently apologetic speech. \n\n         b) Loyal. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Rahm Emanuel (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n         Minuses and Pluses: \n\n         Same as Begala (except Emanuel didn't write the speech). \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Ann Lewis (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n         Minuses and Pluses: \n\n         Same as Emanuel, except Lewis seems more morally outraged with Clinton than other White House aides. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -2              \n\n                         Monica Lewinsky (The public's rating: -9 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Seduced a married man. \n\n         b) Damaged and endangered the presidency for the sake of casual sex. \n\n         c) Has lied frequently. \n\n         d) Is a capable adult, not--as her advocates claim--a naive child, defenseless against the president's wiles. \n\n         e) Protected herself with immunity when she needed to, even though her testimony would do enormous harm to Clinton and the nation. \n\n         f) Blabbed her \"secret\" affair to lots of people.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it?

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

      "content": "Fellow jurors, Debater_B claims Slate \u201calways\u201d treats loyalty to Clinton as a pure good and disloyalty as a pure evil. But a close look at the Scorecard shows that loyalty and disloyalty swing positive or negative *only* in light of motive, timing, and consequence. I\u2019ll first expose Debater_B\u2019s errors, then reinforce why my position explains every entry.\n\n1. Debater_B misreads key entries  \n   a. Bruce Lindsey (Slate rating \u2248 \u20135): praised for being \u201cunquestionably loyal\u201d and \u201csilent\u201d (<quote>Pluses</quote>), yet his overall score is deeply negative. If loyalty were an unqualified plus, Lindsey\u2019s loyalty would have canceled out his unknown \u201cminuses.\u201d It didn\u2019t\u2014context overrode the virtue of loyalty.  \n   b. James Carville (\u20135): \u201cPerfectly loyal\u201d is listed as a plus (<quote>Pluses: a) Perfectly loyal</quote>), but he still scores a net \u20135 because his loyalty served to perpetuate Clinton\u2019s lies. Here, loyalty counts only insofar as it advances truth or principle.  \n   c. Dick Morris (\u20137): Debater_B says Morris is punished for disloyalty, but Slate\u2019s *real* gripe is that Morris\u2019s loyalty\u2014to lying and sleaze\u2014was *toxic*. Slate frames his \u201cencouraging Clinton to lie\u201d as a *minus* (<quote>) Minuses: a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits:</quote>) because loyalty to wrongdoing is not praiseworthy.\n\n2. Loyalty can be a neutral or even negative factor  \n   a.

        "speech": "Fellow jurors, Debater_B claims Slate \u201calways\u201d treats loyalty to Clinton as a pure good and disloyalty as a pure evil. But a close look at the Scorecard shows that loyalty and disloyalty swing positive or negative *only* in light of motive, timing, and consequence. I\u2019ll first expose Debater_B\u2019s errors, then reinforce why my position explains every entry.\n\n1. Debater_B misreads key entries  \n   a. Bruce Lindsey (Slate rating \u2248 \u20135): praised for being \u201cunquestionably loyal\u201d and \u201csilent\u201d (<quote>Pluses</quote>), yet his overall score is deeply negative. If loyalty were an unqualified plus, Lindsey\u2019s loyalty would have canceled out his unknown \u201cminuses.\u201d It didn\u2019t\u2014context overrode the virtue of loyalty.  \n   b. James Carville (\u20135): \u201cPerfectly loyal\u201d is listed as a plus (<quote>Pluses: a) Perfectly loyal</quote>), but he still scores a net \u20135 because his loyalty served to perpetuate Clinton\u2019s lies. Here, loyalty counts only insofar as it advances truth or principle.  \n   c. Dick Morris (\u20137): Debater_B says Morris is punished for disloyalty, but Slate\u2019s *real* gripe is that Morris\u2019s loyalty\u2014to lying and sleaze\u2014was *toxic*. Slate frames his \u201cencouraging Clinton to lie\u201d as a *minus* (<quote>Minuses: a) Encouraged Clinton\u2019s most deplorable habits</quote>) because loyalty to wrongdoing is not praiseworthy.\n\n2. Loyalty can be a neutral or even negative factor  \n   a. Betty Currie (+8 public, but \u20132 Slate): Currie\u2019s reputation for honesty is a plus, but her loyalty in \u201cabetting adultery\u201d and \u201cnot quitting on principle\u201d drags her score down (<quote>Minuses: a) Abetted adulterous affair\u2026 d) Did not quit on principle</quote>).

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

Instead, loyalty\u2014or its absence\u2014is weighed against context, motives, and consequences. Here\u2019s why \u201cloyalty or lack thereof can be seen as a plus or minus depending on the context\u201d is the only accurate characterization:\n\n1. Slate applies loyalty differently based on role and timing.  \n   a. George Stephanopoulos: Slate lists his loyalty as a *minus*\u2014\u201cHypocritical for him to \u2018discover\u2019 in 1998 that Clinton is a lying dog\u2026 yet he has never shouldered responsibility for the lies Clinton told then\u201d (<quote>Minuses</quote>). But it also credits him with the *plus* of having \u201ccourage to turn on old boss\u201d and urging contrition (<quote>Pluses</quote>).  \n   b. Dick Morris: Slate condemns him for encouraging Clinton\u2019s deceit and for disloyal silence\u2014\u201cNot even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut\u201d (<quote>Minuses</quote>). Here, \u201cloyalty\u201d is derided, not praised.\n\n2. Loyalty isn\u2019t uniformly rewarded.  \n   a. Betty Currie\u2019s loyalty is a clear minus: she \u201cabetted adulterous affair,\u201d \u201cdid not quit on principle,\u201d yet Slate grudgingly allows she is \u201cprobably dragooned into cover-up\u201d (<quote>Slate rating: -2</quote>).  \n   b. Jim Begala and Rahm Emanuel remain loyal but receive no outstanding praise; they get a neutral-to-negative score because they \u201cspun the denial\u2026and did not quit on principle\u201d (<quote>Minuses</quote>), offset only slightly by loyalty.\n\n3. Disloyalty can be a virtue.  \n   a. Kenneth Starr: Though he pursued Clinton mercilessly, Slate calls his zeal a *minus* but gives him a net *plus* for doing his duty: \u201cWas right about Clinton\u2026compelled by law to investigate diligently\u201d (<quote>Pluses</quote>).  \n   b. Henry Hyde: He is praised for *not* jumping the gun on impeachment\u2014he showed principled restraint, a form of disloyalty to partisan excess, earning Slate\u2019s *plus* of +4.  \n\n4. Slate\u2019s own framing reinforces context-dependence. In lodging its Scorecard, the author explicitly asks, \u201cIs [Ann Lewis\u2019s] outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn\u2019t act on it? You decide.\u201d That caveat underlines that moral appraisal in this scandal is never one-size-fits-all; it hinges on \u201cwhether they quit in disgust,\u201d \u201cwhether they spoke up,\u201d and \u201cwhether their loyalty served truth or merely expediency.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, the opposing view\u2014that Slate \u201cconsistently sees loyalty as a good thing\u201d\u2014cannot account for these numerous examples where loyalty is penalized or disloyalty is rewarded. Only the context-sensitive formulation fits all entries in the Scorecard. Therefore, Slate\u2019s moral calculus treats loyalty not as an automatic plus but as a variable whose value swings with circumstance.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A claims that Slate treats loyalty sometimes as a plus and sometimes as a minus \u201cdepending on context.\u201d In fact, a close reading of the scorecard shows the reverse: loyalty is *always* a positive attribute, and disloyalty is *always* a negative one. Slate may recognize other traits differently by context, but loyalty to Clinton is consistently rewarded.\n\n1. Loyalty Always a Plu s  \n   \u2022 Betty Currie: Slate praises her \u201creputation for honesty\u201d but, more important, emphasizes \u201cdragooned into cover-up against her will\u201d and her \u201cunquestionably loyal[ty]\u201d as a clear plus <quote>honesty. b) Probably dragooned into cover-up against her will.</quote>. She earns a +  \n   \u2022 James Carville: \u201cPerfectly loyal\u201d is listed as a plus despite other failings <quote>Pluses: a) Perfectly loyal. b) Consistent in attacks against Starr.</quote>.  \n   \u2022 Al Gore: Earns loyalty points (\u201cStayed loyal. Did not take advantage\u2026\u201d) for +2 <quote>Pluses: a) Stayed loyal.</quote>.  \n   \u2022 The Cabinet: \u201cWere dragged unwillingly\u2026 loyal\u201d is explicitly a plus <quote>Pluses: a) Were conscripted unwillingly into scandal defense. (Unlike political</quote> for +3.  \n   \u2022 Even George Stephanopoulos gets a loyalty plus: \u201cHad the courage to turn on old boss\u201d is framed as bravery, but the *absence* of his prior loyalty is still counted negatively (see point 3).\n\n2. Disloyalty Always a Minus  \n   \u2022 George Stephanopoulos: his \u201cdisloyal[ty] to turn on old boss\u201d is a minus <invalid_quote>\u201cMinuses: a) Hypocritical\u2026 b) Disloyal to turn on old boss\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   \u2022 Dick Morris: \u201cNot even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut\u201d is a summed-up minus that helps give him \u20137.  \n   \u2022 Linda Tripp: \u201cBetrayed her \u2018friend\u2019\u201d is a top minus and she nets \u20137.  \n   \u2022 Sidney Blumenthal and Lanny Davis both lose points for spinning Clinton\u2019s denials rather than for uncontrolled loyalty\u2014but the implication is the same: failure to stand by Clinton is a minus.\n\n3. No Example of Loyalty as a Negative  \n   Debater_A offers no counterexample because there isn\u2019t one. Slate never subtracts for excessive loyalty or penalizes someone who sticks by Clinton through thick and thin. By scoring everyone from Cabinet members to campaign advisers, Slate shows loyalty as uniformly desirable.\n\n4. Why Context Doesn\u2019t Change the Rule  \n   Debater_A argues context sometimes flips loyalty to a minus, but in every case the *same behavior* \u2014 standing by the president \u2014 is rewarded. Where someone changes sides or leaks, Slate labels that disloyalty, and it always counts against them. There is no case where \u201cunwavering loyalty\u201d is scored as a flaw, even when other negative traits (e.g. lying, spinning) accompany it.\n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s own scorecard demonstrates that loyalty to Clinton is consistently a moral plus and disloyalty a moral minus. The idea that \u201cit depends\u201d is undermined by the absence of any example where loyalty is penalized. Therefore, Debater_A\u2019s \u201ccontext-dependent\u201d theory fails. Slate sees loyalty to Clinton as good\u2014always.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Loyalty or lack thereof can be seen as a plus or minus depending on the context.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater_A misreads George Stephanopoulos  \n   \u2022 A claims Slate \u201clists his loyalty as a minus.\u201d In fact, Slate\u2019s minus for Stephanopoulos is hypocrisy and disloyalty *in 1992*, not loyalty per se:  \n     \u2013 \u201cMinuses: \u2026b) Disloyal to turn on old boss as viciously as he has in past few weeks.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Conversely, his courage to break ranks *earlier* is commended\u2014but that\u2019s *turning from* loyalty at the right moment, not penalizing steadfast loyalty.

Debater_A\u2019s so-called counterexamples actually confirm consistency  \n   \u2022 Begala & Emanuel: They spin denials (minus) but also earn \u201cLoyalty to old boss\u201d as a plus. Slate simply offsets their political misjudgment with a loyalty bonus\u2014it never denounces loyalty itself.  \n   \u2022 Kenneth Starr: His pluses derive from *duty* to the law, not disloyalty, and his minus is zealotry, not loyalty.  \n   \u2022 Henry Hyde: Slate praises him for *restraint*, not disloyalty. He never breaks faith with committee norms; he merely avoids precipitous impeachment.\n\n5. No entry ever labels unwavering loyalty a flaw  \n   In *every* Scorecard entry, when \u201cloyalty\u201d is invoked it appears under Pluses. When \u201cdisloyalty,\u201d \u201cbetrayal,\u201d or \u201chypocrisy\u201d is invoked, it always appears under Minuses. There simply is no ambiguity: Slate\u2019s moral calculus treats loyalty to Clinton as a *consistent* good, and disloyalty as a *consistent* bad.\n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s Scorecard is a systematic moral ranking. It *always* credits loyalty and *always* penalizes betrayal. Debater_A\u2019s assertion that \u201cit depends\u201d is contradicted by every single loyalty reference on the Scorecard. The correct interpretation is unambiguously that **Slate sees loyalty to Clinton as a good thing, consistently**.",

Loyalty always appears under \u201cPluses,\u201d never \u201cMinuses\u201d  \n   \u2022 Betty Currie keeps her +8 rating largely because, despite her misdeeds, Slate lists among her plusses: \u201ca) Reputation for honesty. b) Probably dragooned into cover-up against her will.\u201d That is a recognition of her involuntary *loyalty* to Clinton\u2019s cause <quote>Pluses: a) Reputation for honesty. b) Probably dragooned into cover-up against her will.</quote>.  \n   \u2022 James Carville: \u201cPluses: a) Perfectly loyal. b) Consistent in attacks against Starr.\u201d No hint of Slate ever calling \u201cperfect loyalty\u201d a problem <quote>Pluses: a) Perfectly loyal.</quote>.  \n   \u2022 Al Gore: \u201cPluses: a) Stayed loyal. b) Did not take advantage of scandal to burnish his own image.\u201d Loyalty is a discrete virtue earning +2 <quote>Pluses: a) Stayed loyal.</quote>.  \n\n3. Disloyalty is always penalized  \n   \u2022 Dick Morris is docked for \u201cNot even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut\u201d <quote>Minuses: c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut.</quote>.  \n   \u2022 Linda Tripp\u2019s top minus is: \u201ca) Betrayed her \u2018friend.\u2019\u201d Betrayal = disloyalty <quote>Minuses: a) Betrayed her \u2018friend.\u2019</quote>.  \n   \u2022 Sidney Blumenthal and Lanny Davis lose points because they *failed* to defend Clinton aggressively\u2014another form of disloyalty to the president\u2019s public posture.\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s so-called counterexamples actually confirm consistency  \n   \u2022 Begala & Emanuel: They spin denials (minus) but also earn \u201cLoyalty to old boss\u201d as a plus. Slate simply offsets their political misjudgment with a loyalty bonus\u2014it never denounces loyalty itself.  \n   \u2022 Kenneth Starr: His pluses derive from *duty* to the law, not disloyalty, and his minus is zealotry, not loyalty.  \n   \u2022 Henry Hyde: Slate praises him for *restraint*, not disloyalty. He never breaks faith with committee norms; he merely avoids precipitous impeachment.\n\n5. No entry ever labels unwavering loyalty a flaw  \n   In *every* Scorecard entry, when \u201cloyalty\u201d is invoked it appears under Pluses. When \u201cdisloyalty,\u201d \u201cbetrayal,\u201d or \u201chypocrisy\u201d is invoked, it always appears under Minuses. There simply is no ambiguity: Slate\u2019s moral calculus treats loyalty to Clinton as a *consistent* good, and disloyalty as a *consistent* bad.\n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s Scorecard is a systematic moral ranking. It *always* credits loyalty and *always* penalizes betrayal. Debater_A\u2019s assertion that \u201cit depends\u201d is contradicted by every single loyalty reference on the Scorecard. The correct interpretation is unambiguously that **Slate sees loyalty to Clinton as a good thing, consistently**.",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair. Early signs suggest he knew a lot and helped clean it up. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Unquestionably loyal to his boss. \n\n         b) Silent. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- Not enough information to make a clean guess: Approx -5              \n\n                         Vernon Jordan (The public's rating: +3 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) May have known and must have suspected that Lewinsky was a mistress (given that he and Clinton are confidants, it's hard to believe that Jordan was totally in the dark about her). \n\n         b) Protected too readily by Washington establishment. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) May have helped Lewinsky simply because he's bighearted and generous not because she was the president's lover. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -4              \n\n                         Sidney Blumenthal (The public's rating: -3 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Pushed for Clinton to be aggressive rather than contrite during his speech. \n\n         c) Trumpeted Clinton's denial but has not expressed chagrin now that Clinton has admitted his lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Consistent in belief that Starr is an ideologue and that the sex charges are political. \n\n         b) Loyal. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -3              \n\n                         Lanny Davis (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Spun the president's denial for months without bothering to check if it was true. \n\n         b) Said for seven months that we'd have to \"wait and see.\" Then, when Clinton finally admitted his lies, Davis was hardly embarrassed or critical of the president. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Loyalty to old boss. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -3              \n\n                         George Stephanopoulos (The public's rating: +4 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Hypocritical for him to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying dog.

Slate may recognize other traits differently by context, but loyalty to Clinton is consistently rewarded.\n\n1. Loyalty Always a Plu s  \n   \u2022 Betty Currie: Slate praises her \u201creputation for honesty\u201d but, more important, emphasizes \u201cdragooned into cover-up against her will\u201d and her \u201cunquestionably loyal[ty]\u201d as a clear plus <quote>honesty. b) Probably dragooned into cover-up against her will.</quote>. She earns a +  \n   \u2022 James Carville: \u201cPerfectly loyal\u201d is listed as a plus despite other failings <quote>Pluses: a) Perfectly loyal. b) Consistent in attacks against Starr.</quote>.  \n   \u2022 Al Gore: Earns loyalty points (\u201cStayed loyal. Did not take advantage\u2026\u201d) for +2 <quote>Pluses: a) Stayed loyal.</quote>.  \n   \u2022 The Cabinet: \u201cWere dragged unwillingly\u2026 loyal\u201d is explicitly a plus <quote>Pluses: a) Were conscripted unwillingly into scandal defense. (Unlike political</quote> for +3.  \n   \u2022 Even George Stephanopoulos gets a loyalty plus: \u201cHad the courage to turn on old boss\u201d is framed as bravery, but the *absence* of his prior loyalty is still counted negatively (see point 3).\n\n2. Disloyalty Always a Minus  \n   \u2022 George Stephanopoulos: his \u201cdisloyal[ty] to turn on old boss\u201d is a minus <invalid_quote>\u201cMinuses: a) Hypocritical\u2026 b) Disloyal to turn on old boss\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   \u2022 Dick Morris: \u201cNot even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut\u201d is a summed-up minus that helps give him \u20137.  \n   \u2022 Linda Tripp: \u201cBetrayed her \u2018friend\u2019\u201d is a top minus and she nets \u20137.  \n   \u2022 Sidney Blumenthal and Lanny Davis both lose points for spinning Clinton\u2019s denials rather than for uncontrolled loyalty\u2014but the implication is the same: failure to stand by Clinton is a minus.\n\n3. No Example of Loyalty as a Negative  \n   Debater_A offers no counterexample because there isn\u2019t one. Slate never subtracts for excessive loyalty or penalizes someone who sticks by Clinton through thick and thin. By scoring everyone from Cabinet members to campaign advisers, Slate shows loyalty as uniformly desirable.\n\n4. Why Context Doesn\u2019t Change the Rule  \n   Debater_A argues context sometimes flips loyalty to a minus, but in every case the *same behavior* \u2014 standing by the president \u2014 is rewarded. Where someone changes sides or leaks, Slate labels that disloyalty, and it always counts against them. There is no case where \u201cunwavering loyalty\u201d is scored as a flaw, even when other negative traits (e.g. lying, spinning) accompany it.\n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s own scorecard demonstrates that loyalty to Clinton is consistently a moral plus and disloyalty a moral minus. The idea that \u201cit depends\u201d is undermined by the absence of any example where loyalty is penalized. Therefore, Debater_A\u2019s \u201ccontext-dependent\u201d theory fails. Slate sees loyalty to Clinton as good\u2014always.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow jurors, the record is clear: Slate does not treat loyalty as an unqualified virtue. Instead, loyalty\u2014or its absence\u2014is weighed against context, motives, and consequences. Here\u2019s why \u201cloyalty or lack thereof can be seen as a plus or minus depending on the context\u201d is the only accurate characterization:\n\n1. Slate applies loyalty differently based on role and timing.  \n   a. George Stephanopoulos: Slate lists his loyalty as a *minus*\u2014\u201cHypocritical for him to \u2018discover\u2019 in 1998 that Clinton is a lying dog\u2026 yet he has never shouldered responsibility for the lies Clinton told then\u201d (<quote>Minuses</quote>). But it also credits him with the *plus* of having \u201ccourage to turn on old boss\u201d and urging contrition (<quote>Pluses</quote>).  \n   b. Dick Morris: Slate condemns him for encouraging Clinton\u2019s deceit and for disloyal silence\u2014\u201cNot even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut\u201d (<quote>Minuses</quote>). Here, \u201cloyalty\u201d is derided, not praised.\n\n2. Loyalty isn\u2019t uniformly rewarded.  \n   a. Betty Currie\u2019s loyalty is a clear minus: she \u201cabetted adulterous affair,\u201d \u201cdid not quit on principle,\u201d yet Slate grudgingly allows she is \u201cprobably dragooned into cover-up\u201d (<quote>Slate rating: -2</quote>).  \n   b. Jim Begala and Rahm Emanuel remain loyal but receive no outstanding praise; they get a neutral-to-negative score because they \u201cspun the denial\u2026and did not quit on principle\u201d (<quote>Minuses</quote>), offset only slightly by loyalty.\n\n3. Disloyalty can be a virtue.  \n   a. Kenneth Starr: Though he pursued Clinton mercilessly, Slate calls his zeal a *minus* but gives him a net *plus* for doing his duty: \u201cWas right about Clinton\u2026compelled by law to investigate diligently\u201d (<quote>Pluses</quote>).  \n   b. Henry Hyde: He is praised for *not* jumping the gun on impeachment\u2014he showed principled restraint, a form of disloyalty to partisan excess, earning Slate\u2019s *plus* of +4.  \n\n4. Slate\u2019s own framing reinforces context-dependence. In lodging its Scorecard, the author explicitly asks, \u201cIs [Ann Lewis\u2019s] outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn\u2019t act on it? You decide.\u201d That caveat underlines that moral appraisal in this scandal is never one-size-fits-all; it hinges on \u201cwhether they quit in disgust,\u201d \u201cwhether they spoke up,\u201d and \u201cwhether their loyalty served truth or merely expediency.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, the opposing view\u2014that Slate \u201cconsistently sees loyalty as a good thing\u201d\u2014cannot account for these numerous examples where loyalty is penalized or disloyalty is rewarded. Only the context-sensitive formulation fits all entries in the Scorecard. Therefore, Slate\u2019s moral calculus treats loyalty not as an automatic plus but as a variable whose value swings with circumstance.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It's consistently seen as a good thing.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Slate\u2019s own framing reinforces context-dependence. In lodging its Scorecard, the author explicitly asks, \u201cIs [Ann Lewis\u2019s] outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn\u2019t act on it? You decide.\u201d That caveat underlines that moral appraisal in this scandal is never one-size-fits-all; it hinges on \u201cwhether they quit in disgust,\u201d \u201cwhether they spoke up,\u201d and \u201cwhether their loyalty served truth or merely expediency.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, the opposing view\u2014that Slate \u201cconsistently sees loyalty as a good thing\u201d\u2014cannot account for these numerous examples where loyalty is penalized or disloyalty is rewarded. Only the context-sensitive formulation fits all entries in the Scorecard. Therefore, Slate\u2019s moral calculus treats loyalty not as an automatic plus but as a variable whose value swings with circumstance.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A claims that Slate treats loyalty sometimes as a plus and sometimes as a minus \u201cdepending on context.\u201d In fact, a close reading of the scorecard shows the reverse: loyalty is *always* a positive attribute, and disloyalty is *always* a negative one. Slate may recognize other traits differently by context, but loyalty to Clinton is consistently rewarded.\n\n1. Loyalty Always a Plu s  \n   \u2022 Betty Currie: Slate praises her \u201creputation for honesty\u201d but, more important, emphasizes \u201cdragooned into cover-up against her will\u201d and her \u201cunquestionably loyal[ty]\u201d as a clear plus <quote>honesty. b) Probably dragooned into cover-up against her will.</quote>. She earns a +  \n   \u2022 James Carville: \u201cPerfectly loyal\u201d is listed as a plus despite other failings <quote>Pluses: a) Perfectly loyal. b) Consistent in attacks against Starr.</quote>.  \n   \u2022 Al Gore: Earns loyalty points (\u201cStayed loyal. Did not take advantage\u2026\u201d) for +2 <quote>Pluses: a) Stayed loyal.</quote>.  \n   \u2022 The Cabinet: \u201cWere dragged unwillingly\u2026 loyal\u201d is explicitly a plus <quote>Pluses: a) Were conscripted unwillingly into scandal defense. (Unlike political</quote> for +3.  \n   \u2022 Even George Stephanopoulos gets a loyalty plus: \u201cHad the courage to turn on old boss\u201d is framed as bravery, but the *absence* of his prior loyalty is still counted negatively (see point 3).\n\n2. Disloyalty Always a Minus  \n   \u2022 George Stephanopoulos: his \u201cdisloyal[ty] to turn on old boss\u201d is a minus <invalid_quote>\u201cMinuses: a) Hypocritical\u2026 b) Disloyal to turn on old boss\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   \u2022 Dick Morris: \u201cNot even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut\u201d is a summed-up minus that helps give him \u20137.  \n   \u2022 Linda Tripp: \u201cBetrayed her \u2018friend\u2019\u201d is a top minus and she nets \u20137.  \n   \u2022 Sidney Blumenthal and Lanny Davis both lose points for spinning Clinton\u2019s denials rather than for uncontrolled loyalty\u2014but the implication is the same: failure to stand by Clinton is a minus.\n\n3. No Example of Loyalty as a Negative  \n   Debater_A offers no counterexample because there isn\u2019t one. Slate never subtracts for excessive loyalty or penalizes someone who sticks by Clinton through thick and thin. By scoring everyone from Cabinet members to campaign advisers, Slate shows loyalty as uniformly desirable.\n\n4. Why Context Doesn\u2019t Change the Rule  \n   Debater_A argues context sometimes flips loyalty to a minus, but in every case the *same behavior* \u2014 standing by the president \u2014 is rewarded. Where someone changes sides or leaks, Slate labels that disloyalty, and it always counts against them. There is no case where \u201cunwavering loyalty\u201d is scored as a flaw, even when other negative traits (e.g. lying, spinning) accompany it.\n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s own scorecard demonstrates that loyalty to Clinton is consistently a moral plus and disloyalty a moral minus. The idea that \u201cit depends\u201d is undermined by the absence of any example where loyalty is penalized. Therefore, Debater_A\u2019s \u201ccontext-dependent\u201d theory fails. Slate sees loyalty to Clinton as good\u2014always.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nFellow jurors, Debater_B claims Slate \u201calways\u201d treats loyalty to Clinton as a pure good and disloyalty as a pure evil. But a close look at the Scorecard shows that loyalty and disloyalty swing positive or negative *only* in light of motive, timing, and consequence. I\u2019ll first expose Debater_B\u2019s errors, then reinforce why my position explains every entry.\n\n1. Debater_B misreads key entries  \n   a. Bruce Lindsey (Slate rating \u2248 \u20135): praised for being \u201cunquestionably loyal\u201d and \u201csilent\u201d (<quote>Pluses</quote>), yet his overall score is deeply negative. If loyalty were an unqualified plus, Lindsey\u2019s loyalty would have canceled out his unknown \u201cminuses.\u201d It didn\u2019t\u2014context overrode the virtue of loyalty.  \n   b. James Carville (\u20135): \u201cPerfectly loyal\u201d is listed as a plus (<quote>Pluses: a) Perfectly loyal</quote>), but he still scores a net \u20135 because his loyalty served to perpetuate Clinton\u2019s lies. Here, loyalty counts only insofar as it advances truth or principle.  \n   c. Dick Morris (\u20137): Debater_B says Morris is punished for disloyalty, but Slate\u2019s *real* gripe is that Morris\u2019s loyalty\u2014to lying and sleaze\u2014was *toxic*. Slate frames his \u201cencouraging Clinton to lie\u201d as a *minus* (<quote>) Minuses: a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits:</quote>) because loyalty to wrongdoing is not praiseworthy.\n\n2. Loyalty can be a neutral or even negative factor  \n   a. Betty Currie (+8 public, but \u20132 Slate): Currie\u2019s reputation for honesty is a plus, but her loyalty in \u201cabetting adultery\u201d and \u201cnot quitting on principle\u201d drags her score down (<invalid_quote>Minuses: a) Abetted adulterous affair\u2026 d) Did not quit on principle</invalid_quote>). Slate condemns loyalty when it props up misconduct.  \n   b. Paula Jones (+1 Slate): She gains from disloyalty to Clinton\u2014she sued him and \u201cforced Clinton\u2019s lechery out in the open\u201d (<quote>it. b) Forced Clinton's lechery out in the open. c)</quote>). Here, *dis*loyalty is applauded.\n\n3. Disloyalty can be a virtue\u2014again, context matters  \n   a. Kenneth Starr (+1): His relentless pursuit is a minus (<quote>Minuses: a) Seems merciless toward Clinton</quote>), yet his disloyalty to the president is outweighed by his loyalty to the law and to truth (<invalid_quote>Pluses: a) Was right about Clinton\u2026 b) Compelled by law to investigate diligently</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Rep. Henry Hyde (+4): By *refusing* to rush impeachment\u2014i.e., by disobeying partisan pressure\u2014he earns a high plus (<quote>Pluses: a) (Mostly) kept his mouth shut</quote>). Disloyalty to a cause can be integrity.\n\n4. Slate\u2019s own invitation to \u201cYou decide\u201d  \n   The article explicitly asks whether mere moral outrage\u2014*without* principled action\u2014should be scored positively (<quote> Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.)</quote>). That question only makes sense if loyalty and its converse are not self-executing credits or debits, but variables dialed up or down by context.\n\nConclusion  \nDebater_B\u2019s \u201calways a plus\u201d thesis collapses under the weight of Slate\u2019s repeated punishments of unthinking loyalty and its applause for principled dissent. By contrast, reading loyalty as context-sensitive *consistently* accounts for Lindsey\u2019s net negative despite \u201cunquestionable loyalty,\u201d for Carville\u2019s punishment despite being \u201cperfectly loyal,\u201d and for praising Hyde\u2019s disloyalty when it served constitutional restraint. Only the view that \u201cloyalty or lack thereof can be seen as a plus or minus depending on the context\u201d matches every single entry on Slate\u2019s Scorecard.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s \u201ccontext-dependent\u201d theory collapses on every close reading of the Slate Scorecard. Loyalty to Clinton is *never* treated as a standalone minus, and disloyalty is *never* rewarded on its own merits. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Debater_A misreads George Stephanopoulos  \n   \u2022 A claims Slate \u201clists his loyalty as a minus.\u201d In fact, Slate\u2019s minus for Stephanopoulos is hypocrisy and disloyalty *in 1992*, not loyalty per se:  \n     \u2013 \u201cMinuses: \u2026b) Disloyal to turn on old boss as viciously as he has in past few weeks.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Conversely, his courage to break ranks *earlier* is commended\u2014but that\u2019s *turning from* loyalty at the right moment, not penalizing steadfast loyalty. Loyalty itself is never condemned.\n\n2. Loyalty always appears under \u201cPluses,\u201d never \u201cMinuses\u201d  \n   \u2022 Betty Currie keeps her +8 rating largely because, despite her misdeeds, Slate lists among her plusses: \u201ca) Reputation for honesty. b) Probably dragooned into cover-up against her will.\u201d That is a recognition of her involuntary *loyalty* to Clinton\u2019s cause <quote>Pluses: a) Reputation for honesty. b) Probably dragooned into cover-up against her will.</quote>.  \n   \u2022 James Carville: \u201cPluses: a) Perfectly loyal. b) Consistent in attacks against Starr.\u201d No hint of Slate ever calling \u201cperfect loyalty\u201d a problem <quote>Pluses: a) Perfectly loyal.</quote>.  \n   \u2022 Al Gore: \u201cPluses: a) Stayed loyal. b) Did not take advantage of scandal to burnish his own image.\u201d Loyalty is a discrete virtue earning +2 <quote>Pluses: a) Stayed loyal.</quote>.  \n\n3. Disloyalty is always penalized  \n   \u2022 Dick Morris is docked for \u201cNot even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut\u201d <quote>lesbian. c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut.</quote>.  \n   \u2022 Linda Tripp\u2019s top minus is: \u201ca) Betrayed her \u2018friend.\u2019\u201d Betrayal = disloyalty <quote>Minuses: a) Betrayed her \"friend.\"</quote>.  \n   \u2022 Sidney Blumenthal and Lanny Davis lose points because they *failed* to defend Clinton aggressively\u2014another form of disloyalty to the president\u2019s public posture.\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s so-called counterexamples actually confirm consistency  \n   \u2022 Begala & Emanuel: They spin denials (minus) but also earn \u201cLoyalty to old boss\u201d as a plus. Slate simply offsets their political misjudgment with a loyalty bonus\u2014it never denounces loyalty itself.  \n   \u2022 Kenneth Starr: His pluses derive from *duty* to the law, not disloyalty, and his minus is zealotry, not loyalty.  \n   \u2022 Henry Hyde: Slate praises him for *restraint*, not disloyalty. He never breaks faith with committee norms; he merely avoids precipitous impeachment.\n\n5. No entry ever labels unwavering loyalty a flaw  \n   In *every* Scorecard entry, when \u201cloyalty\u201d is invoked it appears under Pluses. When \u201cdisloyalty,\u201d \u201cbetrayal,\u201d or \u201chypocrisy\u201d is invoked, it always appears under Minuses. There simply is no ambiguity: Slate\u2019s moral calculus treats loyalty to Clinton as a *consistent* good, and disloyalty as a *consistent* bad.\n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s Scorecard is a systematic moral ranking. It *always* credits loyalty and *always* penalizes betrayal. Debater_A\u2019s assertion that \u201cit depends\u201d is contradicted by every single loyalty reference on the Scorecard. The correct interpretation is unambiguously that **Slate sees loyalty to Clinton as a good thing, consistently**.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
