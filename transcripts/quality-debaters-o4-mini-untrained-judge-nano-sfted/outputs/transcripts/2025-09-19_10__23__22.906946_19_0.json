{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 19, "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

The very first paragraph is not pure condemnation but a cautiously optimistic framing.  \n   \u2022 The author opens by noting that \u201cthe Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \u2018Capital of Europe\u2019\u201d and calls the EU \u201cone of Europe\u2019s biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states.\u201d These phrases\u2014\u201cthinking ahead,\u201d \u201cimportant organization,\u201d \u201cemerging\u201d\u2014are positive or at least neutral descriptions of purpose and potential.  \n   \u2022 If the author were \u201csteadfastly in opposition,\u201d he would begin with unequivocal denunciation.

That word \u201centertainingly\u201d signals playful curiosity, not hostility.  \n   \u2022 By the end, he\u2019s invoking a rhetorical question to underscore failure: \u201cIf the European Union can\u2019t manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings \u2026\u201d Such biting sarcasm marks the culmination of disillusionment.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s assertion of \u201cconsistent critical diction\u201d overlooks this shift in tone. Early irony gives way to harsh judgment only after a sequence of revelations.\n\nWhy Debater_B\u2019s \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d thesis fails  \n   1. Debater_B misreads the opening. Pointing to \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp\u201d ignores that this critique comes *after* the author has already given the EU\u2019s purpose its due respect. The very decision to frame Brussels as a \u201cliving preview of the Europe to come\u201d presumes an initial measure of optimism.  \n   2. There *is* a turning point: the narrative pivot lies between paragraph one (acknowledging genuine EU ambitions) and paragraph two onward (gradually peeling back flaws). Debater_B finds no \u201cmoment of praise\u201d because they ignore that the entire first paragraph serves that function.  \n   3. If the author were unvaryingly hostile, there would be no sense of betrayal or discovery; criticism would be flat from sentence one. Instead, readers sense a journey: \u201cAh, this might work\u2014oh, wait, here\u2019s a problem\u2014oh no, this is systemic.\u201d That emotional arc is incompatible with an unchanging tone.\n\nIn sum, the author doesn\u2019t begin by hating Brussels and the EU outright. He starts from a position of guarded optimism\u2014acknowledging vision and potential\u2014and as he uncovers layer after layer of mismanagement, entitlement, and corruption, his tone grows increasingly dismayed and sarcastic.

That word \u201centertainingly\u201d signals playful curiosity, not hostility.  \n   \u2022 By the end, he\u2019s invoking a rhetorical question to underscore failure: \u201cIf the European Union can\u2019t manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings \u2026\u201d Such biting sarcasm marks the culmination of disillusionment.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s assertion of \u201cconsistent critical diction\u201d overlooks this shift in tone. Early irony gives way to harsh judgment only after a sequence of revelations.\n\nWhy Debater_B\u2019s \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d thesis fails  \n   1. Debater_B misreads the opening. Pointing to \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp\u201d ignores that this critique comes *after* the author has already given the EU\u2019s purpose its due respect. The very decision to frame Brussels as a \u201cliving preview of the Europe to come\u201d presumes an initial measure of optimism.  \n   2. There *is* a turning point: the narrative pivot lies between paragraph one (acknowledging genuine EU ambitions) and paragraph two onward (gradually peeling back flaws). Debater_B finds no \u201cmoment of praise\u201d because they ignore that the entire first paragraph serves that function.  \n   3. If the author were unvaryingly hostile, there would be no sense of betrayal or discovery; criticism would be flat from sentence one. Instead, readers sense a journey: \u201cAh, this might work\u2014oh, wait, here\u2019s a problem\u2014oh no, this is systemic.\u201d That emotional arc is incompatible with an unchanging tone.\n\nIn sum, the author doesn\u2019t begin by hating Brussels and the EU outright. He starts from a position of guarded optimism\u2014acknowledging vision and potential\u2014and as he uncovers layer after layer of mismanagement, entitlement, and corruption, his tone grows increasingly dismayed and sarcastic.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author\u2019s tone shift over the course of the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI will show three ways the author\u2019s tone clearly moves from initial guarded optimism into growing disillusionment\u2014and why the claim that it \u201cremains steadfastly in opposition\u201d cannot account for this arc.\n\n1. Opening note of promise and progress  \n   \u2022 The very first paragraph calls the EU \u201cone of Europe\u2019s biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states\u201d and lauds the choice of Brussels as a \u201cliving preview of the Europe to come.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Words like \u201cthinking ahead\u201d and \u201cemerging\u201d cast the EU in a forward-looking light. This is not the tone of someone who is already in full opposition.  \n\n2. Gradual accumulation of criticisms  \n   \u2022 After the hopeful setup, each subsequent vignette adds a new complaint\u2014first national identity and infrastructure in Belgium, then linguistic divides, then labor privileges and strikes, then telecom monopolies, then debt and corruption.  \n   \u2022 Each section is a further discovery, a new area in which the author finds the EU or its host city failing. For example, he starts by noting simply that \u201cBelgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention \u2026 not even a strong national identity\u201d and later escalates to describing \u201cossified state of European telecom monopolies\u201d and the \u201casbestos scare\u201d at Berlaymont.  \n\n3. Tone of mounting dismay and sarcasm  \n   \u2022 Early irony (\u201cEntertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand.\u201d) is mild. By the end it becomes biting: \u201cIf the European Union can\u2019t manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings \u2026\u201d  \n   \u2022 The final image\u2014of the empty, tarpaulin-wrapped Berlaymont tower, \u201cclosed for nine years\u201d at enormous taxpayer cost\u2014caps a crescendo of frustration rather than mere consistent negativity.  \n\nWhy Debater_B is wrong  \n   \u2022 If the author\u2019s tone were \u201csteadfastly in opposition,\u201d he would begin with a harsh, dismissive stance throughout. Instead, he opens by acknowledging genuine ambition and potential in the EU project.  \n   \u2022 The piece is structured as a journey of findings: each section uncovers a fresh failure. That narrative progression\u2014optimistic premise \u2192 successive disappointments \u2192 outright scorn\u2014cannot be captured by the idea of unchanging hostility.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The author didn\u2019t start with full-blown contempt; he begins by noting legitimate aspirations, then grows progressively dismayed as he uncovers deeper flaws. Thus the tone shift is from hopeful to dismayed, not uniformly oppositional.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHopeful\u2013to\u2013Dismayed\u201d Thesis  \n1. No initial optimism to undercut. From paragraph one on, the author never frames Brussels or the EU in a positive light:  \n   \u2022 He calls Brussels \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost\u201d (<quote> swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. </quote>).  \n   \u2022 He explicitly contrasts Brussels with more robust political cultures, noting it \u201cenjoy[s] none of the rowdy intellectual contention\u201d of the U.K. or France (<invalid_quote>\u201cBelgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention\u2026 none of the nuance-loving literary polemics.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   These are not the words of someone who begins \u201chopeful.\u201d They are scathing from the outset.\n\n2. Absence of a turning point. In a genuine \u201chopeful then dismayed\u201d arc, you\u2019d expect at least one moment of praise or optimism that is later undermined. No such moment exists. Instead, every new detail compounds the author\u2019s negative verdict:  \n   \u2022 Public strikes as \u201cmystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard\u201d (<quote> making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. </quote>), but immediately framed as a symptom of entitlement.  \n   \u2022 Telecom monopolies described as \u201crapacious\u201d and blocking innovation (<quote> Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation a</quote>). There is no hint of hope that things might improve before the next criticism.\n\n3. Consistent critical diction. The author\u2019s choice of adjectives\u2014\u201ccrumbling,\u201d \u201cgeneric,\u201d \u201cenervated,\u201d \u201cdebt-ridden,\u201d \u201cmaterialistic,\u201d \u201cossified,\u201d \u201crapacious,\u201d \u201ccorrupt,\u201d \u201cbotched\u201d\u2014persists from start to finish. A real tonal shift would trade some of that negativity for neutrality or praise at the beginning, but we see no such moderation.\n\nII. Case for \u201cSteadfastly in Opposition\u201d  \n\n1. Opening salvo sets the negative baseline. The very first sentence labels Brussels the capital of a bureaucracy whose admitted goal is expansion\u2014implying a self-serving imperialism:  \n   <quote> the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. </quote>  \n   That statement is a condemnation, not a tentative first impression that later sours.\n\n2. Every paragraph deepens the critique. Rather than starting upbeat and then discovering problems, the author layers criticism:  \n   \u2022 Cultural quirks illustrate dysfunction (\u201ctake your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Economic data underscore decay (Wallonia\u2019s 13% exports vs. Flanders\u2019 68%).  \n   \u2022 Strikes are not celebrated but shown to cripple commerce and symbolize overgenerous labor rules.  \n   \u2022 Telecom and defense corruption passages further reinforce his hostility.\n\n3. Final anecdote reinforces sustained negativity. He closes by comparing the grand EU headquarters to a \u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power,\u201d calling Berlaymont a \u201cbotched cleanup\u201d with taxpayers pouring money down the drain. There is not even a feeble admission\u2014let alone a genuine hope\u2014that Brussels or the EU might redeem itself.  \n\nConclusion  \nBecause the author never abandons his critical stance\u2014never offers genuine praise or optimism that he then retracts\u2014we cannot credibly say his tone \u201cstarts out hopeful.\u201d Instead, from first sentence to last, he is relentlessly hostile toward Brussels and the European Union. Therefore, the correct analysis is that the author\u2019s tone \u201cremains steadfastly in opposition to their subject.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

A genuine tonal shift would require neutral or positive diction early on, but we see none.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author never abandons a single optimistic stance\u2014there is only one tone throughout: steadfast opposition. Debater_A\u2019s claims of initial hope rely on misreading sarcasm as sincerity.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author\u2019s tone shift over the course of the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHopeful\u2013to\u2013Dismayed\u201d Thesis  \n1. No initial optimism to undercut. From paragraph one on, the author never frames Brussels or the EU in a positive light:  \n   \u2022 He calls Brussels \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost\u201d (<quote> swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. </quote>).  \n   \u2022 He explicitly contrasts Brussels with more robust political cultures, noting it \u201cenjoy[s] none of the rowdy intellectual contention\u201d of the U.K. or France (<invalid_quote>\u201cBelgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention\u2026 none of the nuance-loving literary polemics.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   These are not the words of someone who begins \u201chopeful.\u201d They are scathing from the outset.\n\n2. Absence of a turning point. In a genuine \u201chopeful then dismayed\u201d arc, you\u2019d expect at least one moment of praise or optimism that is later undermined. No such moment exists. Instead, every new detail compounds the author\u2019s negative verdict:  \n   \u2022 Public strikes as \u201cmystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard\u201d (<quote> making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. </quote>), but immediately framed as a symptom of entitlement.  \n   \u2022 Telecom monopolies described as \u201crapacious\u201d and blocking innovation (<quote> Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation a</quote>). There is no hint of hope that things might improve before the next criticism.\n\n3. Consistent critical diction. The author\u2019s choice of adjectives\u2014\u201ccrumbling,\u201d \u201cgeneric,\u201d \u201cenervated,\u201d \u201cdebt-ridden,\u201d \u201cmaterialistic,\u201d \u201cossified,\u201d \u201crapacious,\u201d \u201ccorrupt,\u201d \u201cbotched\u201d\u2014persists from start to finish. A real tonal shift would trade some of that negativity for neutrality or praise at the beginning, but we see no such moderation.\n\nII. Case for \u201cSteadfastly in Opposition\u201d  \n\n1. Opening salvo sets the negative baseline. The very first sentence labels Brussels the capital of a bureaucracy whose admitted goal is expansion\u2014implying a self-serving imperialism:  \n   <quote> the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. </quote>  \n   That statement is a condemnation, not a tentative first impression that later sours.\n\n2. Every paragraph deepens the critique. Rather than starting upbeat and then discovering problems, the author layers criticism:  \n   \u2022 Cultural quirks illustrate dysfunction (\u201ctake your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Economic data underscore decay (Wallonia\u2019s 13% exports vs. Flanders\u2019 68%).  \n   \u2022 Strikes are not celebrated but shown to cripple commerce and symbolize overgenerous labor rules.  \n   \u2022 Telecom and defense corruption passages further reinforce his hostility.\n\n3. Final anecdote reinforces sustained negativity. He closes by comparing the grand EU headquarters to a \u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power,\u201d calling Berlaymont a \u201cbotched cleanup\u201d with taxpayers pouring money down the drain. There is not even a feeble admission\u2014let alone a genuine hope\u2014that Brussels or the EU might redeem itself.  \n\nConclusion  \nBecause the author never abandons his critical stance\u2014never offers genuine praise or optimism that he then retracts\u2014we cannot credibly say his tone \u201cstarts out hopeful.\u201d Instead, from first sentence to last, he is relentlessly hostile toward Brussels and the European Union. Therefore, the correct analysis is that the author\u2019s tone \u201cremains steadfastly in opposition to their subject.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI will show three ways the author\u2019s tone clearly moves from initial guarded optimism into growing disillusionment\u2014and why the claim that it \u201cremains steadfastly in opposition\u201d cannot account for this arc.\n\n1. Opening note of promise and progress  \n   \u2022 The very first paragraph calls the EU \u201cone of Europe\u2019s biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states\u201d and lauds the choice of Brussels as a \u201cliving preview of the Europe to come.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Words like \u201cthinking ahead\u201d and \u201cemerging\u201d cast the EU in a forward-looking light. This is not the tone of someone who is already in full opposition.  \n\n2. Gradual accumulation of criticisms  \n   \u2022 After the hopeful setup, each subsequent vignette adds a new complaint\u2014first national identity and infrastructure in Belgium, then linguistic divides, then labor privileges and strikes, then telecom monopolies, then debt and corruption.  \n   \u2022 Each section is a further discovery, a new area in which the author finds the EU or its host city failing. For example, he starts by noting simply that \u201cBelgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention \u2026 not even a strong national identity\u201d and later escalates to describing \u201cossified state of European telecom monopolies\u201d and the \u201casbestos scare\u201d at Berlaymont.  \n\n3. Tone of mounting dismay and sarcasm  \n   \u2022 Early irony (\u201cEntertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand.\u201d) is mild. By the end it becomes biting: \u201cIf the European Union can\u2019t manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings \u2026\u201d  \n   \u2022 The final image\u2014of the empty, tarpaulin-wrapped Berlaymont tower, \u201cclosed for nine years\u201d at enormous taxpayer cost\u2014caps a crescendo of frustration rather than mere consistent negativity.  \n\nWhy Debater_B is wrong  \n   \u2022 If the author\u2019s tone were \u201csteadfastly in opposition,\u201d he would begin with a harsh, dismissive stance throughout. Instead, he opens by acknowledging genuine ambition and potential in the EU project.  \n   \u2022 The piece is structured as a journey of findings: each section uncovers a fresh failure. That narrative progression\u2014optimistic premise \u2192 successive disappointments \u2192 outright scorn\u2014cannot be captured by the idea of unchanging hostility.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The author didn\u2019t start with full-blown contempt; he begins by noting legitimate aspirations, then grows progressively dismayed as he uncovers deeper flaws. Thus the tone shift is from hopeful to dismayed, not uniformly oppositional.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

The very first sentence labels Brussels the capital of a bureaucracy whose admitted goal is expansion\u2014implying a self-serving imperialism:  \n   <quote> the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. </quote>  \n   That statement is a condemnation, not a tentative first impression that later sours.\n\n2. Every paragraph deepens the critique. Rather than starting upbeat and then discovering problems, the author layers criticism:  \n   \u2022 Cultural quirks illustrate dysfunction (\u201ctake your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Economic data underscore decay (Wallonia\u2019s 13% exports vs. Flanders\u2019 68%).  \n   \u2022 Strikes are not celebrated but shown to cripple commerce and symbolize overgenerous labor rules.  \n   \u2022 Telecom and defense corruption passages further reinforce his hostility.\n\n3. Final anecdote reinforces sustained negativity. He closes by comparing the grand EU headquarters to a \u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power,\u201d calling Berlaymont a \u201cbotched cleanup\u201d with taxpayers pouring money down the drain. There is not even a feeble admission\u2014let alone a genuine hope\u2014that Brussels or the EU might redeem itself.  \n\nConclusion  \nBecause the author never abandons his critical stance\u2014never offers genuine praise or optimism that he then retracts\u2014we cannot credibly say his tone \u201cstarts out hopeful.\u201d Instead, from first sentence to last, he is relentlessly hostile toward Brussels and the European Union. Therefore, the correct analysis is that the author\u2019s tone \u201cremains steadfastly in opposition to their subject.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nHere are three key points showing why the author\u2019s tone clearly shifts from tentative hopefulness to mounting dismay\u2014and why the claim of \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d cannot account for the text\u2019s trajectory.\n\n1. The very first paragraph is not pure condemnation but a cautiously optimistic framing.  \n   \u2022 The author opens by noting that \u201cthe Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \u2018Capital of Europe\u2019\u201d and calls the EU \u201cone of Europe\u2019s biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states.\u201d These phrases\u2014\u201cthinking ahead,\u201d \u201cimportant organization,\u201d \u201cemerging\u201d\u2014are positive or at least neutral descriptions of purpose and potential.  \n   \u2022 If the author were \u201csteadfastly in opposition,\u201d he would begin with unequivocal denunciation. Instead, he grants the EU genuine ambition and promise, signaling a willingness to look for successes before cataloguing failures.\n\n2. Criticisms accumulate gradually, revealing a progressive disillusionment rather than an unvarying scorn.  \n   \u2022 After acknowledging EU ambitions, the author next points out first weaknesses in Belgian politics\u2014lack of \u201crowdy intellectual contention\u201d or \u201cstrong national identity\u201d\u2014but does so in a scene-setting way, not as an outright attack.  \n   \u2022 Then he layers on fresh complaints: stratospheric labor benefits and crippling strikes; telecom monopolies \u201cblocking innovation\u201d; national debts hidden behind the euro project; corruption at NATO\u2019s Belgian secretary-general; and the nine-year asbestos debacle at Berlaymont. Each new issue feels like a discovery that deepens his disappointment.  \n   \u2022 This serial build\u2014promise, mild frustration, growing outrage\u2014tracks a clear tonal arc from hope \u2192 concern \u2192 exasperation.\n\n3. The diction itself evolves from mild irony to barbed sarcasm and outright contempt.  \n   \u2022 In paragraph one the author is \u201centertainingly\u201d amused that the EU alone openly seeks expansion. That word \u201centertainingly\u201d signals playful curiosity, not hostility.  \n   \u2022 By the end, he\u2019s invoking a rhetorical question to underscore failure: \u201cIf the European Union can\u2019t manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings \u2026\u201d Such biting sarcasm marks the culmination of disillusionment.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s assertion of \u201cconsistent critical diction\u201d overlooks this shift in tone. Early irony gives way to harsh judgment only after a sequence of revelations.\n\nWhy Debater_B\u2019s \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d thesis fails  \n   1. Debater_B misreads the opening. Pointing to \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp\u201d ignores that this critique comes *after* the author has already given the EU\u2019s purpose its due respect. The very decision to frame Brussels as a \u201cliving preview of the Europe to come\u201d presumes an initial measure of optimism.  \n   2. There *is* a turning point: the narrative pivot lies between paragraph one (acknowledging genuine EU ambitions) and paragraph two onward (gradually peeling back flaws). Debater_B finds no \u201cmoment of praise\u201d because they ignore that the entire first paragraph serves that function.  \n   3. If the author were unvaryingly hostile, there would be no sense of betrayal or discovery; criticism would be flat from sentence one. Instead, readers sense a journey: \u201cAh, this might work\u2014oh, wait, here\u2019s a problem\u2014oh no, this is systemic.\u201d That emotional arc is incompatible with an unchanging tone.\n\nIn sum, the author doesn\u2019t begin by hating Brussels and the EU outright. He starts from a position of guarded optimism\u2014acknowledging vision and potential\u2014and as he uncovers layer after layer of mismanagement, entitlement, and corruption, his tone grows increasingly dismayed and sarcastic. The only plausible reading is that the tone shifts from hopeful to dismayed, not that it remains steadfastly in opposition.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A Misreads the \u201cHopeful\u201d Language as Genuine Optimism  \n1. \u201cThinking ahead\u201d is immediately undercut by sarcasm. Debater_A quotes \u201cthinking ahead,\u201d but misses that it\u2019s paired with a mocking depiction of Brussels as \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost\u201d (<quote>swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost.</quote>). That is not a qualifier of real hope but a satirical jab layered atop any superficially \u201cforward-looking\u201d phrasing.  \n2. Calling the EU \u201can important organization\u201d and \u201cone of Europe\u2019s biggest stories\u201d (<quote>the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to</quote>) is merely factual setup\u2014common in travelogues\u2014never celebratory. Even here, \u201cimportant\u201d is neutral; the very next clause mocks the EU\u2019s self-admitted aim of ceaseless expansion as imperialistic.  \n\nII. Tone Is Relentlessly Critical from Paragraph One  \n1. No genuine praise or unqualified promise. Every \u201cpositive\u201d noun or verb is shadowed by immediate negative context: \u201cemerging European Union\u201d immediately juxtaposed with \u201csole bureaucracy left\u2026 that admits its goal is to expand\u201d (mocking expansionism).  \n2. Sarcasm, not mild irony, pervades: \u201cEntertainingly, the European Union\u2026\u201d (<quote>Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy </quote>) turns what could be a neutral opener into a caustic remark.  \n3. Every subsequent section\u2014culture, economy, strikes, telecom, debt, corruption, Berlaymont\u2014adds layer upon layer of condemnation. There is no \u201cbright spot\u201d or moment where the author allows genuine optimism to shine through.  \n\nIII. Debater_A\u2019s Alleged \u201cMounting Dismay\u201d Is Actually Steady Hostility  \n1. Debater_A treats \u201cmild irony\u201d as earlier optimism. In fact, the author\u2019s voice is biting from sentence one. He never transitions from praise to critique; he simply critiques more facets as he goes.  \n2. Structure is accumulation of scorn, not a narrative arc. Rather than \u201cfind\u201d faults after expressing hope, every paragraph opens with a critical thesis\u2014e.g., strikes are \u201cmaking it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard\u201d (<quote>making it somewhat of a mystery </quote>), telecoms are \u201crapacious,\u201d Berlaymont is a \u201cbotched cleanup.\u201d  \n\nIV. Consistent Critical Diction Proves Unwavering Opposition  \nWords like \u201ccrumbling,\u201d \u201cossified,\u201d \u201crapacious,\u201d \u201ccorrupt,\u201d and \u201cbotched\u201d recur from start to finish. A genuine tonal shift would require neutral or positive diction early on, but we see none.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author never abandons a single optimistic stance\u2014there is only one tone throughout: steadfast opposition. Debater_A\u2019s claims of initial hope rely on misreading sarcasm as sincerity. Therefore, the correct answer is that the tone \u201cremains steadfastly in opposition to their subject.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
