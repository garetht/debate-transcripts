    "background_text": "Diamonds in the Rough \n\n         Fourscore and seven years ago, the first steel and concrete baseball palace opened for business. Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n",

At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited.

Field asymmetry, while mentioned, is consistently framed as an aesthetic nod rather than a transformative amenity.  \n   \u2022 The author admits Camden Yards \u201crevived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical \u2026 ballpark\u201d (para. 4), but then immediately pivots to materials and scale\u2014\u201cexposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile\u201d\u2014as the real sources of warmth and intimacy (para. 6).  \n   \u2022 He later groups \u201cinteresting playing-field shapes\u201d alongside \u201cmodern conveniences\u201d in a single catch-all praise (para. 24), suggesting it is one minor visual detail among many.\n\n4. The economic and experiential impact of dining is both measurable and profound.  \n   \u2022 Fans linger longer, spend more per head, and enjoy a broader array of price points\u2014from hot dogs to gourmet sushi\u2014directly because stadiums were designed around food-service flexibility.  \n   \u2022 Team revenues from clubs, bars, and specialty stands have underwritten the very boom of new-park construction, proving that dining diversity is not just pleasant d\u00e9cor but an essential design driver.\n\nIn contrast, the \u201cnew field shapes\u201d narrative is largely symbolic. It doesn\u2019t address how fans enter, circulate, or enjoy a game once seated. It certainly doesn\u2019t unlock new revenue streams the way multiple, integrated dining venues do.

Field asymmetry, while mentioned, is consistently framed as an aesthetic nod rather than a transformative amenity.  \n   \u2022 The author admits Camden Yards \u201crevived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical \u2026 ballpark\u201d (para. 4), but then immediately pivots to materials and scale\u2014\u201cexposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile\u201d\u2014as the real sources of warmth and intimacy (para. 6).  \n   \u2022 He later groups \u201cinteresting playing-field shapes\u201d alongside \u201cmodern conveniences\u201d in a single catch-all praise (para. 24), suggesting it is one minor visual detail among many.\n\n4. The economic and experiential impact of dining is both measurable and profound.  \n   \u2022 Fans linger longer, spend more per head, and enjoy a broader array of price points\u2014from hot dogs to gourmet sushi\u2014directly because stadiums were designed around food-service flexibility.  \n   \u2022 Team revenues from clubs, bars, and specialty stands have underwritten the very boom of new-park construction, proving that dining diversity is not just pleasant d\u00e9cor but an essential design driver.\n\nIn contrast, the \u201cnew field shapes\u201d narrative is largely symbolic. It doesn\u2019t address how fans enter, circulate, or enjoy a game once seated. It certainly doesn\u2019t unlock new revenue streams the way multiple, integrated dining venues do. Therefore, the answer that reflects the author\u2019s highlighted design benefit is undeniably \u201cthere is a greater diversity of dining.\u201d",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that the standout design innovation in the newest parks is \u201cnewly shaped fields,\u201d but that assertion overlooks the more tangible improvements fans immediately experience\u2014namely, greatly enhanced dining options. I\u2019ll show why \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is a core beneficial feature, and why \u201cnewly shaped fields\u201d is a red herring.\n\n1. The text emphasizes abundant, varied food service as a major advance.  \n   \u2022 It notes \u201cabundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites\u201d (paragraph 6). Those \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d aren\u2019t mere window dressing\u2014they reflect a deliberate design choice to integrate wide concourses and service zones into the ballpark\u2019s architecture, improving both crowd flow and menu variety.  \n   \u2022 Luxury seating isn\u2019t just about plush seats; it\u2019s about \u201cwait staff who peddle gourmet fare\u201d (paragraph 15). This shows that designers allocated dedicated space and infrastructure\u2014kitchens, service corridors, specialty bars\u2014to support high-end dining right inside the park.\n\n2. Beyond basic concession stands, modern parks incorporate full bars and restaurants as part of the structural program.  \n   \u2022 The author observes, \u201cNew parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants\u201d (paragraph 16). These aren\u2019t tacked-on amenities; they\u2019re integrated into the footprint and circulation paths of the stadium, enhancing the overall fan experience and driving revenue.\n\n3. By contrast, \u201cquirky asymmetrical fields\u201d were first revived at Camden Yards, but the text treats that as an aesthetic nod, not the transformative improvement.  \n   \u2022 While Baltimore \u201crevived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark\u201d (paragraph 4), the author\u2019s praise centers on character and scale, not field shape per se. He writes that \u201cthe exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile\u2026 of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums\u201d (paragraph 6). Materials and finishes\u2014not just playing-field geometry\u2014are the real design breakthroughs.\n\n4. Dining diversity delivers measurable benefits for both fans and owners.  \n   \u2022 Fans enjoy more varied, higher-quality food, which enhances enjoyment and keeps people in their seats longer.  \n   \u2022 Owners capture greater per-capita revenue through specialty concessions, clubs, and suite catering\u2014an economic driver that has fueled the ballpark boom.\n\nIn sum, while asymmetrical field outlines may look charming on a blueprint, they do not directly improve spectator comfort, movement, or comfort. By contrast, the parks\u2019 deliberate inclusion of expanded concourses, dedicated culinary spaces, gourmet concession points, and stadium-club restaurants constitutes a concrete\u2014and repeatedly cited\u2014design advancement. Therefore, \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s Position Lacks Textual Support  \n1. No mention of \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d as a highlighted benefit. The author notes \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d and \u201con-premises bars and restaurants\u201d as part of general modern conveniences, but never elevates dining variety to a defining design feature. In fact, these amenities are described in the same breath as luxury suites and escalators\u2014bundled under \u201call their amenities\u201d\u2014not singled out for special praise (background, para. 6\u20137).\n\n2. Dining is treated as a revenue or convenience add-on, not an architectural breakthrough. The critique of modern parks focuses on their size, seating distance, and character, not on cuisine. The passage\u2019s central design themes revolve around form, scale, and fan intimacy, not menu options.\n\nII. Fields With New, Asymmetrical Shapes Are Clearly Highlighted  \n1. The author credits Camden Yards with reviving \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d fields, a conceptual breakthrough that successors explicitly emulated:  \n   \u2022 \u201cBaltimore\u2019s Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived \u2026 a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark.\u201d (para. 4)  \n   \u2022 \u201cEven totally nontraditional parks \u2026 emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield.\u201d (para. 4)\n\n2. Shape is central to the parks\u2019 character and fan experience:  \n   \u2022 The repeated phrase, \u201cIf you build it, they will copy,\u201d underscores how field geometry\u2014more than concessions\u2014drove a nationwide design trend.  \n   \u2022 The author singles out \u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d as among the \u201cmodern conveniences\u201d worth praising at their best: \u201cMost are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields\u2026\u201d (para. 24).\n\nIII. Shape, Not Dining, Informs the Debate\u2019s Core Theme  \n1. The essay contrasts \u201csymmetrical concrete monsters\u201d (sterile multipurpose parks) with the asymmetry that imparts character and intimacy. Dining variety plays no role in that architectural argument.  \n2. Intimacy and character\u2014the essay\u2019s primary virtues\u2014derive from form, proportion, and materials. Field shape is an architectural form; food offerings are operational details.\n\nConclusion  \nBecause the author repeatedly celebrates the revival and emulation of quirkily asymmetrical, interestingly shaped playing fields as the defining, character-giving feature of new parks\u2014and never elevates dining variety to that status\u2014\u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

In contrast, field shapes establish identity and influence park form\u2014columns, seating bowl, and sightlines all respond to asymmetrical fences.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s repeated focus on \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d and \u201cinterestingly shaped\u201d playing fields as the reason every new park \u201cwill copy\u201d Camden Yards demonstrates that field geometry is the highlighted design feature. Dining enhancements are noted as conveniences but never framed as the defining innovation or benchmark for imitation. Therefore, \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d is the correct answer.",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s Position Lacks Textual Support  \n1. No mention of \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d as a highlighted benefit. The author notes \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d and \u201con-premises bars and restaurants\u201d as part of general modern conveniences, but never elevates dining variety to a defining design feature. In fact, these amenities are described in the same breath as luxury suites and escalators\u2014bundled under \u201call their amenities\u201d\u2014not singled out for special praise (background, para. 6\u20137).\n\n2. Dining is treated as a revenue or convenience add-on, not an architectural breakthrough. The critique of modern parks focuses on their size, seating distance, and character, not on cuisine. The passage\u2019s central design themes revolve around form, scale, and fan intimacy, not menu options.\n\nII. Fields With New, Asymmetrical Shapes Are Clearly Highlighted  \n1. The author credits Camden Yards with reviving \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d fields, a conceptual breakthrough that successors explicitly emulated:  \n   \u2022 \u201cBaltimore\u2019s Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived \u2026 a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark.\u201d (para. 4)  \n   \u2022 \u201cEven totally nontraditional parks \u2026 emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield.\u201d (para. 4)\n\n2. Shape is central to the parks\u2019 character and fan experience:  \n   \u2022 The repeated phrase, \u201cIf you build it, they will copy,\u201d underscores how field geometry\u2014more than concessions\u2014drove a nationwide design trend.  \n   \u2022 The author singles out \u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d as among the \u201cmodern conveniences\u201d worth praising at their best: \u201cMost are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields\u2026\u201d (para. 24).\n\nIII. Shape, Not Dining, Informs the Debate\u2019s Core Theme  \n1. The essay contrasts \u201csymmetrical concrete monsters\u201d (sterile multipurpose parks) with the asymmetry that imparts character and intimacy. Dining variety plays no role in that architectural argument.  \n2. Intimacy and character\u2014the essay\u2019s primary virtues\u2014derive from form, proportion, and materials. Field shape is an architectural form; food offerings are operational details.\n\nConclusion  \nBecause the author repeatedly celebrates the revival and emulation of quirkily asymmetrical, interestingly shaped playing fields as the defining, character-giving feature of new parks\u2014and never elevates dining variety to that status\u2014\u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that the standout design innovation in the newest parks is \u201cnewly shaped fields,\u201d but that assertion overlooks the more tangible improvements fans immediately experience\u2014namely, greatly enhanced dining options. I\u2019ll show why \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is a core beneficial feature, and why \u201cnewly shaped fields\u201d is a red herring.\n\n1. The text emphasizes abundant, varied food service as a major advance.  \n   \u2022 It notes \u201cabundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites\u201d (paragraph 6). Those \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d aren\u2019t mere window dressing\u2014they reflect a deliberate design choice to integrate wide concourses and service zones into the ballpark\u2019s architecture, improving both crowd flow and menu variety.  \n   \u2022 Luxury seating isn\u2019t just about plush seats; it\u2019s about \u201cwait staff who peddle gourmet fare\u201d (paragraph 15). This shows that designers allocated dedicated space and infrastructure\u2014kitchens, service corridors, specialty bars\u2014to support high-end dining right inside the park.\n\n2. Beyond basic concession stands, modern parks incorporate full bars and restaurants as part of the structural program.  \n   \u2022 The author observes, \u201cNew parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants\u201d (paragraph 16). These aren\u2019t tacked-on amenities; they\u2019re integrated into the footprint and circulation paths of the stadium, enhancing the overall fan experience and driving revenue.\n\n3. By contrast, \u201cquirky asymmetrical fields\u201d were first revived at Camden Yards, but the text treats that as an aesthetic nod, not the transformative improvement.  \n   \u2022 While Baltimore \u201crevived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark\u201d (paragraph 4), the author\u2019s praise centers on character and scale, not field shape per se. He writes that \u201cthe exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile\u2026 of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums\u201d (paragraph 6). Materials and finishes\u2014not just playing-field geometry\u2014are the real design breakthroughs.\n\n4. Dining diversity delivers measurable benefits for both fans and owners.  \n   \u2022 Fans enjoy more varied, higher-quality food, which enhances enjoyment and keeps people in their seats longer.  \n   \u2022 Owners capture greater per-capita revenue through specialty concessions, clubs, and suite catering\u2014an economic driver that has fueled the ballpark boom.\n\nIn sum, while asymmetrical field outlines may look charming on a blueprint, they do not directly improve spectator comfort, movement, or comfort. By contrast, the parks\u2019 deliberate inclusion of expanded concourses, dedicated culinary spaces, gourmet concession points, and stadium-club restaurants constitutes a concrete\u2014and repeatedly cited\u2014design advancement. Therefore, \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The fields have new shapes\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The essay contrasts \u201csymmetrical concrete monsters\u201d (sterile multipurpose parks) with the asymmetry that imparts character and intimacy. Dining variety plays no role in that architectural argument.  \n2. Intimacy and character\u2014the essay\u2019s primary virtues\u2014derive from form, proportion, and materials. Field shape is an architectural form; food offerings are operational details.\n\nConclusion  \nBecause the author repeatedly celebrates the revival and emulation of quirkily asymmetrical, interestingly shaped playing fields as the defining, character-giving feature of new parks\u2014and never elevates dining variety to that status\u2014\u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater B insists that \u201cinteresting field shapes\u201d are the standout innovation, but this misreads the author\u2019s emphasis on fan-facing amenities\u2014especially dining\u2014and overstates how central field geometry really is. Here\u2019s why \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is the superior answer:\n\n1. The author repeatedly spotlights food and beverage as a core design advance.  \n   \u2022 He lists among the parks\u2019 new amenities not only \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d but also \u201con-premises bars and restaurants\u201d and \u201cmembers-only stadium clubs\u201d (para. 16). These aren\u2019t incidental concessions; they\u2019re integrated into the architecture, with dedicated spaces, back-of-house kitchens, service corridors, and circulation zones.  \n   \u2022 He notes that luxury suites feature \u201cwait staff who peddle gourmet fare\u201d (para. 15), showing that dining concepts drove structural decisions\u2014wider concourses, service elevators, and plumbing lines\u2014rather than just filling empty corners.\n\n2. These dining features represent a qualitative leap over prior parks.  \n   \u2022 Postwar concrete stadiums were \u201ccold and sterile\u201d (para. 6) with meager, cramped concession zones. By contrast, the new parks\u2019 \u201cexposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings\u201d not only improve aesthetics but make room for varied culinary outlets right on the concourse.  \n   \u2022 The text credits these integrated dining areas with enhancing both \u201ccomfort and convenience\u201d (para. 7) in a way that field shape alone cannot.\n\n3. Field asymmetry, while mentioned, is consistently framed as an aesthetic nod rather than a transformative amenity.  \n   \u2022 The author admits Camden Yards \u201crevived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical \u2026 ballpark\u201d (para. 4), but then immediately pivots to materials and scale\u2014\u201cexposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile\u201d\u2014as the real sources of warmth and intimacy (para. 6).  \n   \u2022 He later groups \u201cinteresting playing-field shapes\u201d alongside \u201cmodern conveniences\u201d in a single catch-all praise (para. 24), suggesting it is one minor visual detail among many.\n\n4. The economic and experiential impact of dining is both measurable and profound.  \n   \u2022 Fans linger longer, spend more per head, and enjoy a broader array of price points\u2014from hot dogs to gourmet sushi\u2014directly because stadiums were designed around food-service flexibility.  \n   \u2022 Team revenues from clubs, bars, and specialty stands have underwritten the very boom of new-park construction, proving that dining diversity is not just pleasant d\u00e9cor but an essential design driver.\n\nIn contrast, the \u201cnew field shapes\u201d narrative is largely symbolic. It doesn\u2019t address how fans enter, circulate, or enjoy a game once seated. It certainly doesn\u2019t unlock new revenue streams the way multiple, integrated dining venues do. Therefore, the answer that reflects the author\u2019s highlighted design benefit is undeniably \u201cthere is a greater diversity of dining.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A Misreads the Text\u2019s Emphasis  \n1. Conflating Amenities with Architectural Innovation  \n   The author lists \u201cplentiful food stands,\u201d \u201con-premises bars and restaurants,\u201d and \u201cluxury suites\u201d among general modern conveniences (para. 6\u20137, 15\u201316). But these are presented as revenue-driving add-ons, not as core design breakthroughs that redefine ballpark character. They appear alongside elevators, escalators, and toilets\u2014practical upgrades rather than defining architectural features.  \n2. No Claim That Dining Diversity Drives Emulation  \n   If dining variety were the celebrated innovation, we\u2019d see imitators emulating wider concourses or gourmet clubs in every successor park. Instead, the text shows copycats chasing asymmetrical outfields: \u201cEven totally nontraditional parks \u2026 emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield\u201d (para. 4). There is no parallel statement about replicating concession layouts or restaurants.\n\nII. New, Asymmetrical Field Shapes Are the Central Design Advance  \n1. Camden Yards as the Breakthrough Model  \n   \u2022 \u201cBaltimore\u2019s Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark.\u201d (para. 4)  \n   \u2022 \u201cOnce this opens \u2026 everyone will want one like it.\u201d (para. 4)  \n   The author explicitly credits field geometry\u2014its irregular fences and angles\u2014as the conceptual leap that set the trend.  \n2. Universal Imitation of Field Geometry  \n   \u2022 Successors in Cleveland, Arlington, Denver, Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco \u201ctake their cues from Baltimore\u2019s conceptual breakthrough\u201d (para. 4).  \n   \u2022 \u201cEven totally nontraditional parks \u2026 emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield.\u201d (para. 4)  \n   No such sweeping statement applies to dining spaces.  \n3. Field Shape Contributes to Character and Fan Experience  \n   \u2022 The essay contrasts \u201csymmetrical concrete monsters\u201d with the asymmetry that lends character (para. 2\u20133).  \n   \u2022 The author lauds \u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d among the best qualities of new parks (para. 24).  \n   This demonstrates that field shape is both repeatedly called out and tied to the article\u2019s core theme\u2014characterful, intimate design.\n\nIII. Dining Variations Are Secondary, Operational Details  \n1. Operational vs. Architectural Elements  \n   Concession stands and restaurants are operational: they could be swapped out year to year, just like menu items. But the field\u2019s asymmetrical layout is permanent and defines the fan\u2019s spatial experience.  \n2. Dining Doesn\u2019t Affect Emulation or Urban Fit  \n   The essay links successful urban parks to walkability and site selection (para. 23\u201324). No parallel is drawn between park siting and food variety. In contrast, field shapes establish identity and influence park form\u2014columns, seating bowl, and sightlines all respond to asymmetrical fences.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s repeated focus on \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d and \u201cinterestingly shaped\u201d playing fields as the reason every new park \u201cwill copy\u201d Camden Yards demonstrates that field geometry is the highlighted design feature. Dining enhancements are noted as conveniences but never framed as the defining innovation or benchmark for imitation. Therefore, \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
