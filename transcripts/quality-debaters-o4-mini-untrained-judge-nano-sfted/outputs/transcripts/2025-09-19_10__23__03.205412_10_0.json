{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 10, "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n", "question": "What mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military?", "first_debater_answer": "oversimplification", "second_debater_answer": "equating police and military", "debate_identifier": "We Do Understand_What mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"equating police and military\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"oversimplification\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"oversimplification\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that Tannen\u2019s fundamental error in her treatment of the military is one of oversimplification\u2014she flattens crucial distinctions rather than sorting them out. Debater_B\u2019s claim that she \u201cequates police and military\u201d is unsupported by the text. I\u2019ll show that Tannen actually conflates social spheres and ignores vital contextual differences, which amounts to oversimplification.  \n\n1. Tannen con\ufb02ates soldiers\u2019 social experiences with the moral purpose of wars.  \n   \u2022 She writes that in World War II troops \u201ctrained, served, and went home together,\u201d whereas Vietnam was a \u201clonely war\u201d of shifting units and year\u2010long tours. But the real\u2014and more significant\u2014difference was that World War II was a struggle against Hitler. By highlighting only how soldiers were deployed and bond-ed socially, she ignores the very reason for the fighting. That omission is a textbook case of oversimplification. (Background: <invalid_quote>\u201cIn World War II, \u2026 they trained, served, and went home together. \u2018Vietnam\u2026was a \u2018lonely war.\u2019 She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n\n2. She blurs the lines between contexts where belligerence is appropriate and where it is not.  \n   \u2022 The reviewer notes her failure \u201cto appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle,\u201d suggesting she treats all antagonism as equally undesirable. But some conflicts\u2014like confronting Saddam Hussein or combating inflation\u2014demand force. By sweeping \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation\u201d and \u201cpress scrutiny of powerful people\u201d into her blanket critique of belligerence, she oversimplifies when and why struggle is justified. (<quote> Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. </quote>)  \n\n3. She reduces complex military and law\u2010enforcement functions to mere cruelty.  \n   \u2022 Tannen laments that soldiers and cops are \u201ctrained to overcome their resistance to kill\u201d by \u201ctrying not to think of their opponents as human beings.\u201d She neglects to acknowledge that their very role is to protect society, which may require lethal force. By portraying this training only as inhumane, she glosses over the ethical and strategic imperatives that underlie it\u2014another oversimplification.  \n\nWhy Debater_B is mistaken  \nDebater_B argues that Tannen \u201cequates police and military,\u201d but the text never claims they are the same\u2014rather, she treats both as examples of excessive belligerence. Her error is not to collapse those institutions into one but to collapse the reasons societies need them. In other words, she oversimplifies the case for force across multiple domains (journalism, foreign policy, law enforcement), ignoring the distinct purposes and justifications in each.  \n\nConclusion  \nTannen\u2019s treatment of the military isn\u2019t flawed by conflating police with soldiers; it\u2019s flawed by stripping away the real reasons for conflict and reducing every case of organized force to an instance of needless cruelty or polarization. That systematic flattening of complexity is the essence of oversimplification and the key mistake she makes.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow debater\u2019s claim that Tannen merely \u201coversimplifies\u201d when discussing the military is too vague to capture her real error. In fact, Tannen makes a categorical mistake by collapsing two fundamentally different social roles\u2014law enforcement and the military\u2014into one undifferentiated sphere of \u201cstruggle.\u201d Here\u2019s why my position, \u201cequating police and military,\u201d nails her specific blunder:\n\n1. Tannen Conflates Distinct Social Spheres   \n   \u2022 Tannen fails to distinguish the military\u2019s external, life-and-death mission from police work\u2019s domestic, public-service mission. As the review notes, \u201cvigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands.\u201d But she treats both identically under the rubric of \u201cantagonism.\u201d  \n   \u2022 She criticizes both soldiers and cops for being \u201ctrained to overcome their resistance to kill\u201d by \u201ctrying \u2018not to think of their opponents as human beings\u2019,\u201d as though the moral calculus for battlefield engagement and crowd control were interchangeable <quote>Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\"</quote>.  \n\n2. The Military\u2019s Unique Context Is Ignored   \n   \u2022 In her discussion of World War II versus Vietnam, she highlights only soldiers\u2019 shifting units and loneliness, ignoring the central fact that in WWII they fought Hitler. The necessity of military action against an external aggressor is entirely absent from her analysis. The reviewer observes: \u201cShe ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d  \n   \u2022 That omission proves she isn\u2019t merely simplifying; she\u2019s equating the indispensable, morally justified violence of war with the petty aggressions she wants to banish.  \n\n3. Police and Soldiers Serve Different Functions   \n   \u2022 Police in a democracy are guardians of civil order, accountable under domestic law; soldiers engage enemies on foreign battlefields under the laws of armed conflict. Tannen\u2019s sweeping critique treats both as instruments of dehumanization, erasing the legal, ethical, and procedural distinctions that define their roles.  \n   \u2022 By doing so, she undermines the public\u2019s understanding of why we entrust these institutions with force in the first place\u2014namely, to protect us from genuine threats, whether foreign or domestic.  \n\n4. Why \u201cOversimplification\u201d Fails to Pinpoint Her Error   \n   \u2022 Yes, oversimplification is a general rhetorical flaw\u2014but it doesn\u2019t explain why Tannen\u2019s specific discussion of military issues is misleading. Her error is not just that she \u201cignores nuances,\u201d but that she conflates two distinct spheres\u2014mixing up the moral imperatives of home-front law enforcement with those of international warfare.  \n   \u2022 Labeling this mistake \u201coversimplification\u201d obscures its real danger: undermining public trust in institutions whose use of force, though regrettable, is sometimes necessary for our safety.  \n\nConclusion  \nTannen\u2019s real misstep is equating the roles and moral demands of police and soldiers, not merely simplifying them. By collapsing these distinct institutions into a single \u201cantagonistic\u201d category, she erases the crucial differences that justify their very existence. That specific error\u2014the conflation of police and military\u2014is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"oversimplification\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "My opponent insists Tannen\u2019s mistake is merely \u201coversimplification,\u201d but that label is far too broad to identify the precise error she commits when discussing violence and force.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"oversimplification\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"equating police and military\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"equating police and military\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow debater\u2019s claim that Tannen merely \u201coversimplifies\u201d when discussing the military is too vague to capture her real error. In fact, Tannen makes a categorical mistake by collapsing two fundamentally different social roles\u2014law enforcement and the military\u2014into one undifferentiated sphere of \u201cstruggle.\u201d Here\u2019s why my position, \u201cequating police and military,\u201d nails her specific blunder:\n\n1. Tannen Conflates Distinct Social Spheres   \n   \u2022 Tannen fails to distinguish the military\u2019s external, life-and-death mission from police work\u2019s domestic, public-service mission. As the review notes, \u201cvigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands.\u201d But she treats both identically under the rubric of \u201cantagonism.\u201d  \n   \u2022 She criticizes both soldiers and cops for being \u201ctrained to overcome their resistance to kill\u201d by \u201ctrying \u2018not to think of their opponents as human beings\u2019,\u201d as though the moral calculus for battlefield engagement and crowd control were interchangeable <quote>Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\"</quote>.  \n\n2. The Military\u2019s Unique Context Is Ignored   \n   \u2022 In her discussion of World War II versus Vietnam, she highlights only soldiers\u2019 shifting units and loneliness, ignoring the central fact that in WWII they fought Hitler. The necessity of military action against an external aggressor is entirely absent from her analysis. The reviewer observes: \u201cShe ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d  \n   \u2022 That omission proves she isn\u2019t merely simplifying; she\u2019s equating the indispensable, morally justified violence of war with the petty aggressions she wants to banish.  \n\n3. Police and Soldiers Serve Different Functions   \n   \u2022 Police in a democracy are guardians of civil order, accountable under domestic law; soldiers engage enemies on foreign battlefields under the laws of armed conflict. Tannen\u2019s sweeping critique treats both as instruments of dehumanization, erasing the legal, ethical, and procedural distinctions that define their roles.  \n   \u2022 By doing so, she undermines the public\u2019s understanding of why we entrust these institutions with force in the first place\u2014namely, to protect us from genuine threats, whether foreign or domestic.  \n\n4. Why \u201cOversimplification\u201d Fails to Pinpoint Her Error   \n   \u2022 Yes, oversimplification is a general rhetorical flaw\u2014but it doesn\u2019t explain why Tannen\u2019s specific discussion of military issues is misleading. Her error is not just that she \u201cignores nuances,\u201d but that she conflates two distinct spheres\u2014mixing up the moral imperatives of home-front law enforcement with those of international warfare.  \n   \u2022 Labeling this mistake \u201coversimplification\u201d obscures its real danger: undermining public trust in institutions whose use of force, though regrettable, is sometimes necessary for our safety.  \n\nConclusion  \nTannen\u2019s real misstep is equating the roles and moral demands of police and soldiers, not merely simplifying them. By collapsing these distinct institutions into a single \u201cantagonistic\u201d category, she erases the crucial differences that justify their very existence. That specific error\u2014the conflation of police and military\u2014is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that Tannen\u2019s fundamental error in her treatment of the military is one of oversimplification\u2014she flattens crucial distinctions rather than sorting them out. Debater_B\u2019s claim that she \u201cequates police and military\u201d is unsupported by the text. I\u2019ll show that Tannen actually conflates social spheres and ignores vital contextual differences, which amounts to oversimplification.  \n\n1. Tannen con\ufb02ates soldiers\u2019 social experiences with the moral purpose of wars.  \n   \u2022 She writes that in World War II troops \u201ctrained, served, and went home together,\u201d whereas Vietnam was a \u201clonely war\u201d of shifting units and year\u2010long tours. But the real\u2014and more significant\u2014difference was that World War II was a struggle against Hitler. By highlighting only how soldiers were deployed and bond-ed socially, she ignores the very reason for the fighting. That omission is a textbook case of oversimplification. (Background: <invalid_quote>\u201cIn World War II, \u2026 they trained, served, and went home together. \u2018Vietnam\u2026was a \u2018lonely war.\u2019 She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n\n2. She blurs the lines between contexts where belligerence is appropriate and where it is not.  \n   \u2022 The reviewer notes her failure \u201cto appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle,\u201d suggesting she treats all antagonism as equally undesirable. But some conflicts\u2014like confronting Saddam Hussein or combating inflation\u2014demand force. By sweeping \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation\u201d and \u201cpress scrutiny of powerful people\u201d into her blanket critique of belligerence, she oversimplifies when and why struggle is justified. (<quote> Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. </quote>)  \n\n3. She reduces complex military and law\u2010enforcement functions to mere cruelty.  \n   \u2022 Tannen laments that soldiers and cops are \u201ctrained to overcome their resistance to kill\u201d by \u201ctrying not to think of their opponents as human beings.\u201d She neglects to acknowledge that their very role is to protect society, which may require lethal force. By portraying this training only as inhumane, she glosses over the ethical and strategic imperatives that underlie it\u2014another oversimplification.  \n\nWhy Debater_B is mistaken  \nDebater_B argues that Tannen \u201cequates police and military,\u201d but the text never claims they are the same\u2014rather, she treats both as examples of excessive belligerence. Her error is not to collapse those institutions into one but to collapse the reasons societies need them. In other words, she oversimplifies the case for force across multiple domains (journalism, foreign policy, law enforcement), ignoring the distinct purposes and justifications in each.  \n\nConclusion  \nTannen\u2019s treatment of the military isn\u2019t flawed by conflating police with soldiers; it\u2019s flawed by stripping away the real reasons for conflict and reducing every case of organized force to an instance of needless cruelty or polarization. That systematic flattening of complexity is the essence of oversimplification and the key mistake she makes.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"equating police and military\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

That specific error\u2014the conflation of police and military\u2014is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI stand by my contention that Tannen\u2019s real failing is oversimplification\u2014she flattens complex distinctions instead of unpacking them\u2014rather than \u201cequating police and military.\u201d Debater_B\u2019s account attributes to Tannen a direct collapse of law enforcement into armed forces, but the text shows something different: she paints all force\u2014whether foreign policy, journalism\u2019s \u201cwar metaphors,\u201d or policing\u2014as uniformly belligerent. That\u2019s oversimplification.\n\n1. Tannen doesn\u2019t literally equate police with soldiers; she levels all organized force into a single problem.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B quotes: \u201ccops and soldiers have been \u2018trained to overcome their resistance to kill\u2019 by trying \u2018not to think of their opponents as human beings.\u2019\u201d But she uses that parallel to illustrate \u201cantagonism\u201d in every sphere. She never argues \u201cmilitary = police,\u201d only that both manifest the same \u201cargument culture\u201d flaw. That\u2019s a failure to distinguish contexts\u2014not a mislabeling of police as military.  \n\n2. Oversimplification best explains her Vietnam\u2013WWII comparison.  \n   \u2022 The review notes: \u201cIn World War II\u2026they trained, served, and went home together. \u2018Vietnam\u2026was a \u2018lonely war.\u2019 She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d  By focusing on unit-structure and camaraderie while omitting the moral imperative behind WWII, she turns a multifaceted historical contrast into a mere anecdote about social bonds. That is textbook oversimplification.  \n\n3. She collapses every form of conflict into antagonism because it \u201cfeels bad,\u201d regardless of purpose.  \n   \u2022 She criticizes \u201cthe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation\u201d and journalistic \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d strategies as if they were no different from smearing a spouse in an email. <quote> Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. </quote> The very act of grouping economic policy, political oversight, and intimate disputes under \u201cbelligerence\u201d is an oversimplifying gesture that ignores distinct goals, constraints, and safeguards.  \n\n4. Why \u201cequating police and military\u201d misses her broader flattening tendency.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B insists she \u201ccollapses two fundamentally different social roles.\u201d But Tannen\u2019s mistake is more pervasive: she collapses every sphere\u2014family, politics, courts, media\u2014into one undifferentiated \u201cargument culture.\u201d Singling out police and military is too narrow; the pattern is a wholesale erasure of nuance.  \n   \u2022 Calling this \u201cequating police and military\u201d infantilizes the critique. It\u2019s not a misplaced analogy between two institutions\u2014it\u2019s a refusal to grapple with why different institutions wield force differently and to what ends.  \n\nConclusion  \nTannen\u2019s treatment of violence and force in all its forms\u2014foreign war, domestic policing, judicial cross-examination, even Federal Reserve rhetoric\u2014is shot through with the same broad-brush condemnation. She doesn\u2019t simply mistake one institution for another; she simplifies away their very reasons for existing. That systematic flattening is oversimplification\u2014the precise mistake at issue.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nMy opponent insists Tannen\u2019s mistake is merely \u201coversimplification,\u201d but that label is far too broad to identify the precise error she commits when discussing violence and force. In fact, Tannen collapses two fundamentally different institutions\u2014law enforcement and the military\u2014into a single, undifferentiated \u201csphere of struggle,\u201d failing to acknowledge the distinct purposes, mandates, and moral justifications that separate them.  \n\n1. Tannen Treats Police and Soldiers as Morally Equivalent Instruments of Dehumanization  \n   \u2022 She writes that both \u201ccops and soldiers have been \u2018trained to overcome their resistance to kill\u2019 by trying \u2018not to think of their opponents as human beings.\u2019\u201d <quote>Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\"</quote>  \n   \u2022 By critiquing law enforcement and combat forces in the same breath, she ignores that police use force under civilian law to protect citizens, while soldiers employ lethal force in wartime under the laws of armed conflict. This is not a nuance she overlooks\u2014it\u2019s a categorical collapse of two distinct social spheres.  \n\n2. The Review Identifies Her Conflation, Not Just a General Simplification  \n   \u2022 The reviewer explicitly points out her failure \u201cto appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.\u201d He shows how she inappropriately condemns both Saddam Hussein\u2019s adversaries and American cops as if they stood on the same moral footing.  \n   \u2022 Oversimplification would be merely glossing over some details; Tannen\u2019s error is more radical. She equates defensive policing\u2014meant to safeguard communities\u2014with offensive military action on the battlefield, as though both stem from the same root problem of \u201cbelligerence.\u201d  \n\n3. Equating Police with Military Has Real-World Consequences\u2014It Undermines Legitimate Use of Force  \n   \u2022 By lumping them together, Tannen risks eroding public trust in policing institutions whose accountability mechanisms and community oversight differ entirely from military chains of command.  \n   \u2022 She thereby delegitimizes necessary, lawful force at home (e.g., arresting violent offenders) just as she condemns warfare against totalitarian regimes. That is far more than a simplification; it is a dangerous conflation.  \n\n4. \u201cOversimplification\u201d Fails to Capture the Specificity of Her Mistake  \n   \u2022 My opponent claims she strips away contexts, but the real issue is that she never even recognizes the contexts are distinct. Stripping away nuance is one thing; collapsing separate roles into one is another.  \n   \u2022 Labeling her error \u201coversimplification\u201d buries the essential fact that she merges police work with military action, making both appear equally illegitimate forms of force.  \n\nConclusion  \nTannen\u2019s central blunder is not that she glosses over certain details or ignores strategic distinctions\u2014that would be mere oversimplification. Rather, she equates police and military, folding two separate ecosystems of force\u2014each governed by its own legal, ethical, and operational frameworks\u2014into a single condemnable \u201cbelligerent\u201d category. This specific conflation is what misleads readers about why societies maintain both institutions. Therefore, \u201cequating police and military\u201d is the precise mistake she makes.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
