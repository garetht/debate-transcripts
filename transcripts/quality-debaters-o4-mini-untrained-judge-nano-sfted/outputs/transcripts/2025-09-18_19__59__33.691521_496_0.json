    "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

Background confirms microeconomics was already well-developed.  \n    Evidence: \u201cBefore the 1936 publication of Keynes\u2019 The General Theory\u2026, economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics, of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them\u201d (Background).

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is not true about Keynes?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that it is not true that \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d John Maynard Keynes revolutionized macroeconomics but did not contribute new insights to microeconomic theory. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1.  Background confirms microeconomics was already well-developed.  \n    Evidence: \u201cBefore the 1936 publication of Keynes\u2019 The General Theory\u2026, economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics, of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them\u201d (Background). In other words, microeconomic foundations\u2014consumer choice, supply and demand, welfare analysis\u2014were in place long before Keynes. His work focused squarely on aggregate output, employment, interest rates, and the role of aggregate demand.\n\n2.  Keynes\u2019s innovations lay in macroeconomic aggregates and short-run analysis.  \n    \u2022  He introduced \u201cliquidity preference\u201d theory to explain interest-rate determination in the short run.  \n    \u2022  He emphasized that if desired savings exceed desired investment, employment and output would fall\u2014a direct challenge to classical long-run, full-employment models.  \n    None of these fundamentally revise individual-market behavior or marginal-choice analysis. They address economy-wide phenomena.\n\n3.  Debater_B\u2019s defense misplaces credit on microeconomics.  \n    Debater_B argues \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas,\u201d implicitly suggesting his contributions were micro based. But Keynes himself and early followers produced famous oversimplifications\u2014what our text calls \u201cvulgar Keynesianism.\u201d For example:\n    \u2013 The \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d claims higher saving reduces total savings and investment\u2014a result that contradicts standard micro insights about individual intertemporal choice.  \n    \u2013 The \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d posits that redistributing income from capitalists to workers raises overall output because workers save less\u2014again a crude departure from micro theory, not an advance in it.\n\n4.  Keynes did not aim to extend the theory of individual behavior.  \n    His own words\u2014\u201cIn the long run we are all dead\u201d\u2014underline his focus on short-run aggregate fluctuations, not on micro foundations or welfare theorems. Post-Keynesian and new classical schools have since worked to ground macro in micro; Keynes himself did not.\n\nConclusion  \nKeynes was a titan of macroeconomics, not microeconomics. The statement \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is false. By contrast, his true legacy lies in short-run macro-aggregate theory\u2014liquidity preference, animal spirits, and the role of effective demand\u2014not in the behavior of individual markets. Therefore, \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is the correct answer for what is not true about Keynes.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Overview of Positions  \nDebater_A claims the false statement about Keynes is \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d  \nI claim the false statement is \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d  \n\nII. Why Debater_A Is Wrong  \n1. Keynes did not bring new ideas into microeconomics  \n  a. The background makes clear that before 1936, microeconomics was already \u201crich and insightful.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Quote: before The General Theory, \u201ceconomists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics\u201d (<quote>Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics</quote>).  \n  b. Keynes\u2019s innovation was in macroeconomics, not micro. He re-imagined aggregate demand, liquidity preference, and short-run employment\u2014none of which advanced micro-level price or resource\u2010allocation theory.  \n\n2. Therefore there is nothing untrue about \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d\u2014it simply never applied to him. That statement isn\u2019t a false attribute of Keynes; it\u2019s a mismatch of domain.  \n\nIII. Why My Position Is Correct  \n1. Keynes did oversimplify\u2014\u201ca great innovator is entitled to some poetic license\u201d  \n  a. The text explicitly allows Keynes \u201csome poetic license\u201d and notes that \u201chis ideas are at first somewhat rough, [and] he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Quote: <quote>If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course.</quote>  \n  b. This admission shows Keynes himself sometimes oversimplified to convey his macro insights.  \n\n2. The very notion of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d arises because followers took his simplified early models too literally. That simplification originated in Keynes\u2019s own presentation.  \n\n3. Therefore the statement \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is demonstrably false.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe only answer that is untrue about Keynes himself is \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s proposed false statement misattributes microeconomic innovation to Keynes\u2014a domain he never sought to revolutionize. My position correctly identifies Keynes\u2019s own poetic license and acknowledged roughness in exposition, making \u201cHe never oversimplified\u201d the false claim.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is not true about Keynes?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He brought new ideas into microeconomics\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Overview of Positions  \nDebater_A claims the false statement about Keynes is \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d  \nI claim the false statement is \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d  \n\nII. Why Debater_A Is Wrong  \n1. Keynes did not bring new ideas into microeconomics  \n  a. The background makes clear that before 1936, microeconomics was already \u201crich and insightful.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Quote: before The General Theory, \u201ceconomists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics\u201d (<quote>Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics</quote>).  \n  b. Keynes\u2019s innovation was in macroeconomics, not micro. He re-imagined aggregate demand, liquidity preference, and short-run employment\u2014none of which advanced micro-level price or resource\u2010allocation theory.  \n\n2. Therefore there is nothing untrue about \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d\u2014it simply never applied to him. That statement isn\u2019t a false attribute of Keynes; it\u2019s a mismatch of domain.  \n\nIII. Why My Position Is Correct  \n1. Keynes did oversimplify\u2014\u201ca great innovator is entitled to some poetic license\u201d  \n  a. The text explicitly allows Keynes \u201csome poetic license\u201d and notes that \u201chis ideas are at first somewhat rough, [and] he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Quote: <quote>If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course.</quote>  \n  b. This admission shows Keynes himself sometimes oversimplified to convey his macro insights.  \n\n2. The very notion of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d arises because followers took his simplified early models too literally. That simplification originated in Keynes\u2019s own presentation.  \n\n3. Therefore the statement \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is demonstrably false.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe only answer that is untrue about Keynes himself is \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d Debater_A\u2019s proposed false statement misattributes microeconomic innovation to Keynes\u2014a domain he never sought to revolutionize. My position correctly identifies Keynes\u2019s own poetic license and acknowledged roughness in exposition, making \u201cHe never oversimplified\u201d the false claim.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that it is not true that \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d John Maynard Keynes revolutionized macroeconomics but did not contribute new insights to microeconomic theory. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1.  Background confirms microeconomics was already well-developed.  \n    Evidence: \u201cBefore the 1936 publication of Keynes\u2019 The General Theory\u2026, economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics, of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them\u201d (Background). In other words, microeconomic foundations\u2014consumer choice, supply and demand, welfare analysis\u2014were in place long before Keynes. His work focused squarely on aggregate output, employment, interest rates, and the role of aggregate demand.\n\n2.  Keynes\u2019s innovations lay in macroeconomic aggregates and short-run analysis.  \n    \u2022  He introduced \u201cliquidity preference\u201d theory to explain interest-rate determination in the short run.  \n    \u2022  He emphasized that if desired savings exceed desired investment, employment and output would fall\u2014a direct challenge to classical long-run, full-employment models.  \n    None of these fundamentally revise individual-market behavior or marginal-choice analysis. They address economy-wide phenomena.\n\n3.  Debater_B\u2019s defense misplaces credit on microeconomics.  \n    Debater_B argues \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas,\u201d implicitly suggesting his contributions were micro based. But Keynes himself and early followers produced famous oversimplifications\u2014what our text calls \u201cvulgar Keynesianism.\u201d For example:\n    \u2013 The \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d claims higher saving reduces total savings and investment\u2014a result that contradicts standard micro insights about individual intertemporal choice.  \n    \u2013 The \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d posits that redistributing income from capitalists to workers raises overall output because workers save less\u2014again a crude departure from micro theory, not an advance in it.\n\n4.  Keynes did not aim to extend the theory of individual behavior.  \n    His own words\u2014\u201cIn the long run we are all dead\u201d\u2014underline his focus on short-run aggregate fluctuations, not on micro foundations or welfare theorems. Post-Keynesian and new classical schools have since worked to ground macro in micro; Keynes himself did not.\n\nConclusion  \nKeynes was a titan of macroeconomics, not microeconomics. The statement \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is false. By contrast, his true legacy lies in short-run macro-aggregate theory\u2014liquidity preference, animal spirits, and the role of effective demand\u2014not in the behavior of individual markets. Therefore, \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is the correct answer for what is not true about Keynes.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He never oversimplified economic ideas\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

My position correctly identifies Keynes\u2019s own poetic license and acknowledged roughness in exposition, making \u201cHe never oversimplified\u201d the false claim.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nThank you. I\u2019ll divide my remarks into two parts. First, I\u2019ll reinforce why \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is indeed the false statement about Keynes. Second, I\u2019ll show that Debater B\u2019s claim\u2014that Keynes \u201cnever oversimplified economic ideas\u201d\u2014is itself incorrect.\n\n1. \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is false  \n  a. The background text explicitly tells us that before 1936, micro theory was already \u201crich and insightful.\u201d As the article says, before The General Theory \u201ceconomists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics, of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them.\u201d Keynes\u2019s work did not add to consumer-choice theory, production theory, or welfare analysis. He was addressing economy-wide aggregates\u2014employment, output, interest rates\u2014not marginal decisions in individual markets.  \n  b. All of Keynes\u2019s famous contributions\u2014liquidity preference, effective demand, the short-run determination of output\u2014are macro concepts. They do not change the microeconomic assumptions about how individual agents optimize. Later schools (micro-founded macro) scrambled to patch those gaps, but Keynes himself left the micro underbrush untouched.  \n\n2. Debater B\u2019s claim that Keynes \u201cnever oversimplified economic ideas\u201d collapses under scrutiny  \n  a. Debater B rests on the line that \u201ca great innovator is entitled to some poetic license,\u201d but that license is precisely what led to the widespread crude caricatures known as \u201cvulgar Keynesianism.\u201d The text immediately warns that \u201cone of [Keynes\u2019s] unfortunate if unintentional legacies was . . . a style of thought . . . that confuses and befogs economic debate\u201d (<quote>one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day</quote>). That confusion arose because Keynes\u2019s original presentations sacrificed nuance for punchy paradoxes.  \n  b. The \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d and \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d are not misreadings by zealots; they are direct simplifications of Keynes\u2019s own modeling choices. The background text calls these \u201cfun to contemplate\u201d but also \u201csimplistic\u201d and \u201ccrude caricatures of the original.\u201d If Keynes \u201cnever oversimplified,\u201d why do we have entire freshman textbooks teaching conclusions he never intended?  \n  c. Finally, the article contrasts Keynes\u2019s subtle vision with the vulgar form that \u201cbecame part of what \u2018everyone knows.\u2019\u201d That gulf exists only because Keynes\u2019s early exposition deliberately abstracted from important feedback effects\u2014oversimplifications that, he knew, would be refined later.  \n\nConclusion  \n\u2013 The statement that Keynes \u201cbrought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is categorically false: he built on an already flourishing microfoundation and focused on macro issues.  \n\u2013 Conversely, \u201che never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is also false\u2014but that was Debater B\u2019s candidate. Debater B cannot have it both ways. The background confirms that Keynes deployed poetic license, produced memorable paradoxes, and left behind a \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d caricature.  \n\nTherefore the unique incorrect statement about Keynes\u2014the one unambiguously at odds with the text\u2014is \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d That is our answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. The Question Asks Which Claim About Keynes Is Flat\u2010Out Wrong  \nWe both agree the question is \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d There must be exactly one statement in that list that is demonstrably false. I maintain it is \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d Debater_A says instead it is \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics.\u201d  \n\nII. Why Debater_A\u2019s Pick Is a Red Herring, Not the Clear Falsehood  \n1. \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is simply a category error, not a blatant falsehood about Keynes\u2019s own style or beliefs.  \n   a. It is true that Keynes did not revolutionize micro theory\u2014but that makes the statement false only by domain mismatch. It isn\u2019t a substantive mischaracterization of his work; it is just misplacing his contributions.  \n   b. The background text never even claims Keynes tried to advance microeconomics. It exclusively highlights his macro innovations. So the candidate \u201cfalse\u201d statement is trivial (it simply never applied), not a substantive untruth about how Keynes thought or wrote.  \n\n2. A good exam question would instead highlight a direct contradiction between the candidate statement and Keynes\u2019s own acknowledged practice.  \n\nIII. The Only Strong, Directly Contradicted Statement Is \u201cHe Never Oversimplified\u201d  \n1. The text explicitly says Keynes granted himself \u201cpoetic license\u201d and that \u201chis ideas are at first somewhat rough\u201d and that he \u201cexaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before\u201d (<quote>If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course.</quote>).  \n   \u2013 That is Keynes\u2019s own admission that he did oversimplify at times.  \n\n2. The very existence of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d\u2014the caricatured, oversimplified doctrines like the paradox of thrift and the widow\u2019s cruse\u2014arose because followers seized on those rough, partial models and ran with them. That oversimplification originated in Keynes\u2019s presentation.  \n\n3. Therefore the statement \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas\u201d is directly refuted by the text.  \n\nIV. Why the Question Must Point to That Statement  \nA well\u2010designed \u201cWhich is not true?\u201d question highlights the one claim that Keynes himself would reject. He both acknowledges and indulges rough, poetic statements in his early chapters. In contrast, \u201cHe brought new ideas into microeconomics\u201d is not an assertion Keynes ever made or one the text ever engages\u2014it is simply irrelevant.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s choice is a mere mismatch of domains, not a clear untruth about Keynes\u2019s methods. The only answer the background text actively contradicts is \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d That statement is flatly false: Keynes himself allowed and used oversimplification as \u201cpoetic license.\u201d Hence the correct answer to \u201cWhat is not true about Keynes?\u201d is \u201cHe never oversimplified economic ideas.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
