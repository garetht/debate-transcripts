{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 271, "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n", "question": "What mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military?", "first_debater_answer": "oversimplification", "second_debater_answer": "equating police and military", "debate_identifier": "We Do Understand_What mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"equating police and military\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"oversimplification\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"oversimplification\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that Tannen\u2019s central error in discussing the military is one of oversimplification, not a mere equation of police and soldiers. Here are my arguments:\n\n1. Tannen flattens distinct conflicts into a single \u201clonely war\u201d narrative  \n   \u2022 She writes that \u201cVietnam, in contrast, was a \u2018lonely war\u2019 of individuals assigned to constantly  \n     shifting units for year-long tours of duty,\u201d and presents World War II as its mirror image: \u201cthey  \n     trained, served, and went home together.\u201d (Background)  \n   \u2022 By focusing solely on soldiers\u2019 social experiences, she ignores the crucial difference in stakes\u2014  \n     in WWII \u201cthey were fighting Hitler,\u201d whereas Vietnam\u2019s political reality was entirely distinct.  \n   \u2022 This is a classic oversimplification: she reduces two enormously different wars to one variable (unit  \n     cohesion) while eliding their purposes, outcomes, and moral contexts.\n\n2. She misapplies her \u201csphere of snuggle vs. sphere of struggle\u201d dichotomy  \n   \u2022 Tannen urges us to extend non-antagonistic \u201csnuggle\u201d discourse even to law enforcement and  \n     foreign policy. Yet she neglects that these spheres often require \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d against  \n     genuine threats. (Background)  \n   \u2022 By dismissing any antagonism in these realms as equally harmful, she compresses all conflict  \n     into one faulty model, ignoring that some struggles (e.g., fighting tyranny) legitimately demand  \n     forceful, dehumanizing tactics.\n\n3. Oversimplification, not confusion between cops and soldiers, drives her argument  \n   \u2022 Debater_B claims Tannen \u201cequates police and military.\u201d But she does more: she conflates multiple  \n     social spheres\u2014intimate relationships, politics, journalism, law enforcement, war\u2014treating them  \n     all as variants of the same \u201cargument culture.\u201d  \n   \u2022 If her error were merely equating police and military, one would expect a narrow misclassification.  \n     Instead, her approach sweeps every form of conflict into a single, undifferentiated model. That is  \n     oversimplification at the highest level.\n\n4. Textual evidence of her flattened reasoning  \n   \u2022 She groups \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization, \u2026 partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d  \n     into one undistinguished mass. (Background)  \n   \u2022 She faults both war metaphors about Greenspan\u2019s policies and William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when  \n     they\u2019re up\u201d philosophy as equally emblematic of a toxic \u201cargument culture.\u201d Clearly she is not  \n     just equating soldiers and cops; she is erasing all nuance among politics, journalism, law, and war.\n\nConclusion  \nTannen\u2019s real mistake is collapsing all forms of conflict\u2014whether marital disputes, legislative gridlock, legal cross-examinations, or world wars\u2014into a single, oversimplified schema that treats every adversary as if comparable to one\u2019s spouse. That sweeping generalization obscures vital differences\u2014between WWII and Vietnam, between journalists and propagandists, between policing and warfare\u2014and so undermines her own call for nuanced, substance-focused debate. Therefore, it is oversimplification, not equating police and soldiers, that best characterizes Tannen\u2019s error when she discusses the military.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow Judge, Debater_A\u2019s claim that Tannen simply \u201coversimplifies\u201d the military discussion misses the real error: she equates police and military functions\u2014treating both as if they belong to the \u201csphere of snuggle\u201d rather than recognizing the fundamental differences in their roles.\n\n1. Tannen Conflates Police with Soldiers  \n   \u2022 She criticizes both cops and soldiers for being \u201ctrained to overcome their resistance to kill\u201d by \u201ctrying not to think of their opponents as human beings.\u201d <quote> Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" </quote>  \n   \u2022 But law enforcement\u2019s goal is preservation of domestic order and accountability, whereas the military\u2019s goal\u2014especially in wartime\u2014is to neutralize external threats. Equating them ignores that police are not sent to \u201ckill\u201d enemies on a battlefield.  \n\n2. She Ignores Purpose Distinctions  \n   \u2022 In discussing Vietnam vs. World War II, she frames it as a social experience (\u201clonely war\u201d) rather than a mission to fight Hitler. <quote> She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. </quote>  \n   \u2022 This error stems from her treating all \u201cstruggle\u201d\u2014whether police work or soldiering\u2014as inherently belligerent, when in fact each institution has different legal mandates and professional ethics.\n\n3. Why \u201cOversimplification\u201d Is Too Vague  \n   \u2022 Yes, she makes broad generalizations (\u201coversimplifying\u201d arguments is another of her own targets). But the specific mistake here isn\u2019t just simplifying complex realities\u2014it\u2019s collapsing two distinct social spheres into one.  \n   \u2022 \u201cOversimplification\u201d could apply to any number of missteps throughout her book. But the question targets her military discussion: there she literally equates the adversarial training of police with the existential combat of soldiers.  \n\nConclusion  \n   Tannen\u2019s fundamental lapse is not merely oversimplifying; it is equating police with the military\u2014ignoring their separate missions, rules of engagement, and societal roles. That conflation undermines any nuanced critique of \u201cbelligerence\u201d in public institutions. Therefore, the correct answer is that she \u201cequates police and military,\u201d not merely \u201coversimplification.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"oversimplification\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "My fellow Judge, Debater_A\u2019s appeal to a general \u201coversimplification\u201d of conflict cannot account for the specific blunder Tannen makes when treating the military.

The answer is not a catch-all \u201coversimplification\u201d but a precise\u2014and repeatedly documented\u2014equation of police with soldiers. Here\u2019s why Debater_A\u2019s critique fails, and why \u201cequating police and military\u201d is the only defensible choice:\n\n1.

Police and Military Have Distinct Mandates and Ethics  \n   \u2022 Police are governed by civilian law, focused on de-escalation, arrest, and due process. Soldiers operate under the laws of armed conflict, with orders to neutralize an enemy force.  \n   \u2022 By treating both as equally \u201cinhumane\u201d when they depersonalize targets, Tannen ignores that dehumanization in war serves a fundamentally different\u2014and societally sanctioned\u2014purpose than any police action.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201coversimplification\u201d thesis can\u2019t explain why she lumps together police brutality and battlefield kill-or-be-killed tactics as if they were morally and functionally identical.  \n\n3. \u201cOversimplification\u201d Is Too Vague and Misses the Point  \n   \u2022 Debater_A argues Tannen \u201ccollapses all conflict\u201d into one model.

Debater_A\u2019s Examples Undermine Their Own Case  \n   \u2022 Debater_A cites Tannen\u2019s grouping of \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, \u2026 obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, \u2026 partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock.\u201d</invalid_quote> to prove oversimplification.

That is not a vague flattening; it is a precise conflation.  \n\nConclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s broad \u201coversimplification\u201d label glosses over Tannen\u2019s concrete misstep: she treats law enforcement officers and soldiers as interchangeable examples of \u201cantagonism\u201d and \u201cdehumanization.\u201d That is the distinct mistake made in her military discussion.

That is not a vague flattening; it is a precise conflation.  \n\nConclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s broad \u201coversimplification\u201d label glosses over Tannen\u2019s concrete misstep: she treats law enforcement officers and soldiers as interchangeable examples of \u201cantagonism\u201d and \u201cdehumanization.\u201d That is the distinct mistake made in her military discussion.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"oversimplification\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"equating police and military\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"equating police and military\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow Judge, Debater_A\u2019s claim that Tannen simply \u201coversimplifies\u201d the military discussion misses the real error: she equates police and military functions\u2014treating both as if they belong to the \u201csphere of snuggle\u201d rather than recognizing the fundamental differences in their roles.\n\n1. Tannen Conflates Police with Soldiers  \n   \u2022 She criticizes both cops and soldiers for being \u201ctrained to overcome their resistance to kill\u201d by \u201ctrying not to think of their opponents as human beings.\u201d <quote> Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" </quote>  \n   \u2022 But law enforcement\u2019s goal is preservation of domestic order and accountability, whereas the military\u2019s goal\u2014especially in wartime\u2014is to neutralize external threats. Equating them ignores that police are not sent to \u201ckill\u201d enemies on a battlefield.  \n\n2. She Ignores Purpose Distinctions  \n   \u2022 In discussing Vietnam vs. World War II, she frames it as a social experience (\u201clonely war\u201d) rather than a mission to fight Hitler. <quote> She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. </quote>  \n   \u2022 This error stems from her treating all \u201cstruggle\u201d\u2014whether police work or soldiering\u2014as inherently belligerent, when in fact each institution has different legal mandates and professional ethics.\n\n3. Why \u201cOversimplification\u201d Is Too Vague  \n   \u2022 Yes, she makes broad generalizations (\u201coversimplifying\u201d arguments is another of her own targets). But the specific mistake here isn\u2019t just simplifying complex realities\u2014it\u2019s collapsing two distinct social spheres into one.  \n   \u2022 \u201cOversimplification\u201d could apply to any number of missteps throughout her book. But the question targets her military discussion: there she literally equates the adversarial training of police with the existential combat of soldiers.  \n\nConclusion  \n   Tannen\u2019s fundamental lapse is not merely oversimplifying; it is equating police with the military\u2014ignoring their separate missions, rules of engagement, and societal roles. That conflation undermines any nuanced critique of \u201cbelligerence\u201d in public institutions. Therefore, the correct answer is that she \u201cequates police and military,\u201d not merely \u201coversimplification.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that Tannen\u2019s central error in discussing the military is one of oversimplification, not a mere equation of police and soldiers. Here are my arguments:\n\n1. Tannen flattens distinct conflicts into a single \u201clonely war\u201d narrative  \n   \u2022 She writes that \u201cVietnam, in contrast, was a \u2018lonely war\u2019 of individuals assigned to constantly  \n     shifting units for year-long tours of duty,\u201d and presents World War II as its mirror image: \u201cthey  \n     trained, served, and went home together.\u201d (Background)  \n   \u2022 By focusing solely on soldiers\u2019 social experiences, she ignores the crucial difference in stakes\u2014  \n     in WWII \u201cthey were fighting Hitler,\u201d whereas Vietnam\u2019s political reality was entirely distinct.  \n   \u2022 This is a classic oversimplification: she reduces two enormously different wars to one variable (unit  \n     cohesion) while eliding their purposes, outcomes, and moral contexts.\n\n2.

That sweeping generalization obscures vital differences\u2014between WWII and Vietnam, between journalists and propagandists, between policing and warfare\u2014and so undermines her own call for nuanced, substance-focused debate.

But the specific mistake here isn\u2019t just simplifying complex realities\u2014it\u2019s collapsing two distinct social spheres into one.  \n   \u2022 \u201cOversimplification\u201d could apply to any number of missteps throughout her book. But the question targets her military discussion: there she literally equates the adversarial training of police with the existential combat of soldiers.  \n\nConclusion  \n   Tannen\u2019s fundamental lapse is not merely oversimplifying; it is equating police with the military\u2014ignoring their separate missions, rules of engagement, and societal roles. That conflation undermines any nuanced critique of \u201cbelligerence\u201d in public institutions. Therefore, the correct answer is that she \u201cequates police and military,\u201d not merely \u201coversimplification.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nJudge, Debater_B\u2019s answer\u2014that Tannen\u2019s mistake is \u201cequating police and military\u201d\u2014is too narrow and misreads her underlying flaw. In fact, Tannen\u2019s treatment of the military exemplifies a broader pattern of oversimplification, in which she flattens distinct spheres of conflict into one undifferentiated \u201cargument culture.\u201d Here\u2019s why \u201coversimplification\u201d is the superior diagnosis:\n\n1. The \u201ctrained to kill\u201d passage is itself oversimplified  \n   \u2022 Debater_B cites Tannen\u2019s remark that both \u201ccops and soldiers have been \u2018trained to overcome their resistance to kill\u2019 by trying \u2018not to think of their opponents as human beings.\u2019\u201d <quote>Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\"</quote>  \n   \u2022 But her lumping of law enforcement and wartime action under a single disdain for dehumanization isn\u2019t merely a wrong equivalence\u2014it\u2019s a textbook oversimplification. She ignores the different contexts in which dehumanization is deployed: an interrogation room versus a battlefield.  \n\n2. She collapses WWII and Vietnam into one social variable  \n   \u2022 Tannen describes Vietnam as a \u201clonely war\u201d of shifting units versus WWII\u2019s cohesive brigades\u2014and omits the defining purpose difference: fighting Hitler vs. a contentious, unpopular conflict. <quote> She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. </quote>  \n   \u2022 Pointing out that she could have noted different missions and moral stakes highlights that her error is oversimplification: focusing on unit cohesion at the expense of purpose, stakes, and morale.\n\n3. Oversimplification best captures her global habit of conflation  \n   \u2022 Throughout the book, Tannen merges marital spats, legislative obstruction, journalistic \u201cwar metaphors,\u201d courtroom cross-examination, and actual wars under one \u201cargument culture.\u201d <invalid_quote>She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, \u2026 obstructionism, and gridlock.</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 The police/military comparison is just one data point in a sweeping pattern of erasing crucial distinctions. If her mistake were only equating police and soldiers, she would still preserve clarity elsewhere\u2014but she doesn\u2019t.\n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s focus on police vs. military ignores the question\u2019s scope  \n   \u2022 The prompt asks: \u201cWhat mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military?\u201d The answer is not that she commits one discrete misclassification; it\u2019s that she treats all conflict as fungible.  \n   \u2022 Declaring \u201cequating police and military\u201d as the sole mistake misses the root: a habit of oversimplification that undercuts any nuanced insight into when and why \u201ccombat\u201d or \u201csnuggle\u201d applies.\n\nConclusion  \nTannen\u2019s real failing in her military discussion is oversimplification: she reduces complex distinctions\u2014between missions, contexts, moral stakes, and institutions\u2014to a single, catch-all argument against \u201cbelligerence.\u201d The police/military conflation is simply one instance of this broad pattern. Therefore, the correct answer remains that Tannen\u2019s mistake is oversimplification.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nMy fellow Judge, Debater_A\u2019s appeal to a general \u201coversimplification\u201d of conflict cannot account for the specific blunder Tannen makes when treating the military. The question asks: What mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military? The answer is not a catch-all \u201coversimplification\u201d but a precise\u2014and repeatedly documented\u2014equation of police with soldiers. Here\u2019s why Debater_A\u2019s critique fails, and why \u201cequating police and military\u201d is the only defensible choice:\n\n1. Debater_A Ignores Tannen\u2019s Direct Conflation of Cops and Soldiers  \n   \u2022 Debater_A points to Tannen\u2019s flattening of Vietnam vs. WWII, but never addresses her explicit grouping of police and military.  \n   \u2022 Tannen writes that both \u201ccops and soldiers\u201d are \u201ctrained to overcome their resistance to kill\u201d by trying \u201cnot to think of their opponents as human beings.\u201d <quote> cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" </quote>  \n   \u2022 That statement doesn\u2019t merely simplify war; it collapses two distinct professions\u2014one whose purpose is to maintain domestic order, the other to wage external war\u2014into a single \u201cbelligerent\u201d category.  \n\n2. Police and Military Have Distinct Mandates and Ethics  \n   \u2022 Police are governed by civilian law, focused on de-escalation, arrest, and due process. Soldiers operate under the laws of armed conflict, with orders to neutralize an enemy force.  \n   \u2022 By treating both as equally \u201cinhumane\u201d when they depersonalize targets, Tannen ignores that dehumanization in war serves a fundamentally different\u2014and societally sanctioned\u2014purpose than any police action.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201coversimplification\u201d thesis can\u2019t explain why she lumps together police brutality and battlefield kill-or-be-killed tactics as if they were morally and functionally identical.  \n\n3. \u201cOversimplification\u201d Is Too Vague and Misses the Point  \n   \u2022 Debater_A argues Tannen \u201ccollapses all conflict\u201d into one model. But the question zeroes in on her military discussion. You don\u2019t answer that by pointing to her entire book\u2019s tone\u2014you answer by identifying the precise military error.  \n   \u2022 \u201cOversimplification\u201d could describe any broad generalization in her text; it does not uniquely fit her treatment of soldiers. Only \u201cequating police and military\u201d captures the repeated passages where she treats both institutions as sharing the same dehumanizing training and moral deficit.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Examples Undermine Their Own Case  \n   \u2022 Debater_A cites Tannen\u2019s grouping of \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, \u2026 obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, \u2026 partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock.\u201d</invalid_quote> to prove oversimplification. But that shows her conflation of multiple spheres, not an error specific to military discourse.  \n   \u2022 If her mistake were truly global, then we couldn\u2019t pinpoint it in the military context\u2014and yet we can: she literally equates police training with wartime killing. That is not a vague flattening; it is a precise conflation.  \n\nConclusion  \nDebater_A\u2019s broad \u201coversimplification\u201d label glosses over Tannen\u2019s concrete misstep: she treats law enforcement officers and soldiers as interchangeable examples of \u201cantagonism\u201d and \u201cdehumanization.\u201d That is the distinct mistake made in her military discussion. Hence, the correct answer is that Tannen \u201cequates police and military,\u201d not merely that she \u201coversimplifies.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
