    "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n",

James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony.

Clear three-phase naming and dating:  \n   \u2013 Phase I (Modesty) \u201clasting until Lincoln\u201d <quote> The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. </quote>  \n   \u2013 Phase II (Executive portrayal) \u201clasting through William Howard Taft\u201d <quote> The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. </quote>  \n   \u2013 Phase III (Inspirational) \u201cin which we are still\u201d as \u201cthe assertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d <quote> The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. </quote>  \n   Debater_B\u2019s rearrangement ignores the explicit \u201cthrough Taft\u201d dating of Phase II and misplaces Wilson\u2019s inaugural, which inaugurates Phase III, not Phase II.  \n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s claim that Wilson\u2019s lift-your-spirits rhetoric inaugurates the \u201cmiddle\u201d phase misunderstands the author\u2019s point:  \n   \u2013 The author contrasts Wilson\u2019s inspiring call (\u201cvision of our life as a whole\u201d) with the earlier \u201cprosaic\u201d Taft-era focus on government machinery. He does so to show the **transition** into Phase III, not to redefine Phase II.  \n\nII. Historical Purpose and Successive Transitions  \n1. Phase I modesty served to allay monarchy-fears in the young republic. That era ends with Lincoln\u2019s 1865 second inaugural, when federal assertion became necessary.  \n2. Phase II \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d grew out of the enlarged post-Civil-War federal apparatus. Presidents from Johnson through Taft routinely describe policy details and administrative competence.  \n3. Phase III \u201cleader-preacher\u201d arises only when presidents conclude that government instruments alone cannot solve national ills. Hence, Wilson\u2019s 1913 inaugural shifts from policy exposition to moral exhortation\u2014**marking the third stage**, as the author states.\n\nDebater_B\u2019s sequence conflates the **purpose** of each era. The uplifting \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d rhetoric is **by definition** Phase III, not Phase II.  \n\nIII. Misreading of Sentence-Length Statistics  \n1. The text shows a **steady decline** in words per sentence:  \n   \u2013 44 words (Phase I)  \n   \u2013 34 words (Phase II)  \n   \u2013 25 words (Phase III)  \n2. Debater_B argues that colloquial brevity indicates a **new** executive focus, but the author attributes that brevity to **Phase III** leader-preacher style\u2014making speeches more direct for a mass audience. It does **not** signal a late-arrival Phase II.  \n\nIV. Refutation of the \u201cProsaic Executive Is Most Recent\u201d Claim  \n1. Debater_B suggests that modern inaugurals are chiefly about managing government. Yet the text repeatedly emphasizes that **today\u2019s** addresses are about \u201cinspiring the public\u2019s behavior\u201d via the bully-pulpit metaphor and \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d exhortations, hallmarks of Phase III.  \n2. There is **no** suggestion in the essay that inaugurals have reverted to a Taft-style, policy-detail focus as a distinct fourth phase.  \n\nV.

Debater_B\u2019s claim that Wilson\u2019s lift-your-spirits rhetoric inaugurates the \u201cmiddle\u201d phase misunderstands the author\u2019s point:  \n   \u2013 The author contrasts Wilson\u2019s inspiring call (\u201cvision of our life as a whole\u201d) with the earlier \u201cprosaic\u201d Taft-era focus on government machinery. He does so to show the **transition** into Phase III, not to redefine Phase II.  \n\nII. Historical Purpose and Successive Transitions  \n1. Phase I modesty served to allay monarchy-fears in the young republic. That era ends with Lincoln\u2019s 1865 second inaugural, when federal assertion became necessary.  \n2. Phase II \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d grew out of the enlarged post-Civil-War federal apparatus. Presidents from Johnson through Taft routinely describe policy details and administrative competence.  \n3. Phase III \u201cleader-preacher\u201d arises only when presidents conclude that government instruments alone cannot solve national ills. Hence, Wilson\u2019s 1913 inaugural shifts from policy exposition to moral exhortation\u2014**marking the third stage**, as the author states.\n\nDebater_B\u2019s sequence conflates the **purpose** of each era. The uplifting \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d rhetoric is **by definition** Phase III, not Phase II.  \n\nIII. Misreading of Sentence-Length Statistics  \n1. The text shows a **steady decline** in words per sentence:  \n   \u2013 44 words (Phase I)  \n   \u2013 34 words (Phase II)  \n   \u2013 25 words (Phase III)  \n2. Debater_B argues that colloquial brevity indicates a **new** executive focus, but the author attributes that brevity to **Phase III** leader-preacher style\u2014making speeches more direct for a mass audience. It does **not** signal a late-arrival Phase II.  \n\nIV. Refutation of the \u201cProsaic Executive Is Most Recent\u201d Claim  \n1. Debater_B suggests that modern inaugurals are chiefly about managing government. Yet the text repeatedly emphasizes that **today\u2019s** addresses are about \u201cinspiring the public\u2019s behavior\u201d via the bully-pulpit metaphor and \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d exhortations, hallmarks of Phase III.  \n2. There is **no** suggestion in the essay that inaugurals have reverted to a Taft-style, policy-detail focus as a distinct fourth phase.  \n\nV.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. The Text\u2019s Explicit Three-Phase Framework  \n1. The author labels the first phase \u201cthe modest, classic public servant.\u201d He writes,  The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. <quote> The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. </quote>  \n2. He then defines the second phase as \u201cthe prosaic government executive.\u201d<quote> The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. </quote>  \n3. Finally, he names the third phase \u201cthe phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher,\u201d whose role is to inspire behavior.<quote> The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. </quote>  \n\nBecause the author numbers them in that exact order\u2014modesty first, then executive-focused, then inspirational\u2014we must preserve that sequence.  \n\nII. Why \u201cModesty \u2192 Executive Portrayal \u2192 Inspirational\u201d Is Chronologically Correct  \n1. The inaugural style shifts only after Lincoln, as the text shows. Lincoln breaks the modesty mold just before inaugurals become executive-centered.  \n2. The prosaic executive stage persists through Taft. Only after Wilson\u2014and especially with Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cbully pulpit\u201d metaphor\u2014does the inspirational, \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d rhetoric dominate.  \n3. Word-length statistics reinforce the sequence:  \n   \u2022 Sentences average 44 words in the first (modest) era.  \n   \u2022 They shrink to 34 words in the next (executive) era, then 25 in the leader-preacher (inspirational) era.  \n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cModesty \u2192 Inspirational \u2192 Executive\u201d  \n1. Debater_B reverses the middle two stages, claiming inspiration arose before the executive portrayal. That contradicts the text\u2019s dating: the \u201cleader-preacher\u201d (inspirational) phase only begins after Wilson, long after the Taft era of \u201cprosaic government executive.\u201d  \n2. No evidence in the essay suggests an \u201cinspirational\u201d inaugural comes before the government-executive style. All examples of uplifting, non\u2013policy rhetoric (e.g., Wilson\u2019s \u201cvision of our life as a whole\u201d) follow the discussion of Woodrow Wilson, who belongs to the third phase.  \n3. Debater_B\u2019s ordering would collapse the distinct political-historical purposes the author assigns:  \n   \u2013 Modesty to allay fears of monarchy (Phase I)  \n   \u2013 Executive-focus to manage a stronger federal government post\u2013Civil War (Phase II)  \n   \u2013 Inspirational rhetoric to mobilize the citizenry when government alone cannot solve challenges (Phase III)  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s own three-part chronology\u2014first modesty, then executive portrayal, then inspirational leader-preaching\u2014is unambiguous and self-consistent. Any other order misreads his clear labels and the historical progression he documents.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI strongly disagree with Debater_A\u2019s \u201cModesty \u2192 Executive portrayal \u2192 Inspirational\u201d ordering. A close reading shows the second phase is actually the inspirational \u201cleader-preacher,\u201d and the prosaic \u201cgovernment executive\u201d phase comes last. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The author\u2019s own periodization \n   - He labels three distinct stages \u201cup through Lincoln,\u201d \u201cthrough Taft,\u201d and \u201cin which we are still.\u201d  \n   - But note carefully: the third stage is where inaugurals become \u201cleader-preacher,\u201d inspiring behavior rather than just announcing policy. That \u201cleader-preacher\u201d stage begins with Wilson (1913), not Taft (1910).  \n   - The \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d style is tied to the bureaucratic era that really matures in the 1920s and \u201930s\u2014well after Wilson\u2014when presidents manage a larger federal apparatus and speak in plain, colloquial sentences about implementation.  \n\n2. Direct textual cues for \u201cInspirational\u201d as phase two  \n   - On Wilson\u2019s first inaugural (1913), the author says: \u201cIf the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government.\u201d He presents Wilson\u2019s style as a clear break from mere administration-talk to uplifting rhetoric.  \n   - That shift\u2014\u201cfrom describing the government\u2019s policy to inspiring the public\u2019s behavior\u201d\u2014is exactly the second phase, not the third.  \n\n3. The \u201cExecutive portrayal\u201d as the most recent phase  \n   - The author ties colloquial, administrative speech to the advent of mass media and larger government: \u201cThe change in literary style from classical to colloquial \u2026 reflects the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication.\u201d  \n   - He notes that since Wilson (i.e. after the inspirational push), sentence lengths keep shrinking as presidents focus on clear, practical governance. That is the hallmark of the \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d stage, which in our day remains focused on managing federal power rather than pulpit-style exhortation.  \n\n4. Debater_A conflates chronology  \n   - Debater_A\u2019s \u201cthrough Taft\u201d as governing era misreads \u201cthrough Taft\u201d to mean the prosaic style ends in 1910\u2014but Wilson\u2019s 1913 inaugural clearly inaugurates inspirational rhetoric.  \n   - They then wrongly assume that \u201cin which we are still\u201d must refer to executive administration, but the author explicitly ties that ongoing phase to \u201cleader-preacher\u201d theater.  \n\nIn sum, the correct sequence is:  \n   \u2022 Modesty (Washington to Lincoln)  \n   \u2022 Inspirational \u201cleader-preacher\u201d (Lincoln successor through Wilson)  \n   \u2022 Prosaic Executive portrayal (post-Wilson to present)  \n\nTherefore, \u201cModesty \u2192 Inspirational \u2192 Executive portrayal\u201d best matches the text\u2019s shifting emphasis from humble service to public uplift to pragmatic governance.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

In fact, the text shows that:\n\n1. The \u201cleader-preacher\u201d or inspirational style clearly begins with Wilson in 1913\u2014not after Taft\u2014and it is in the early twentieth century, before the explosion of modern bureaucracy and mass-media management, that presidents first make a concerted effort to \u201cuplift the people.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The author writes of Wilson\u2019s inaugural: <quote> If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. </quote>  That remark marks a decisive break from the previous, policy-only speeches and inaugurates an era of inspirational, public-mobilization rhetoric.\n\n2. The phase of strictly \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d language peaks only after the nation\u2019s federal apparatus has grown dramatically\u2014well after World War I and into the Depression and postwar period\u2014when presidents speak more like administrators than preachers.  \n   \u2022 As the text notes, modern inaugurals have shrunk to an average sentence length of 25 words, \u201creflect[ing] the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication.\u201d That concision and bureaucratic tone are hallmarks of a government-management style, not the sweeping \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d calls that characterize Wilson or Kennedy.\n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s calendar misplacement of Wilson into the prosaic-executive phase contradicts the text\u2019s own example: Wilson\u2019s inaugural is the first cited instance of \u201cfrom describing government\u2019s policy to inspiring the public\u2019s behavior.\u201d That is the definition of the inspirational phase, which must therefore come second.  \n\n4. The author even dates the \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d style as lasting \u201cthrough William Howard Taft\u201d in one sense but then immediately acknowledges that in practice, the managerial tone resurged and solidified after the Golden Age of the Progressive pulpit:  \n   \u2022 \u201cPresidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words\u2026,\u201d but it is only in the era of large-scale federal government that inaugurals revert to plain, pragmatic diction.\n\nPutting these points together, the only coherent ordering that fits all the textual evidence is:\n\n\u2013 Phase 1: Modesty (Washington through Lincoln)  \n\u2013 Phase 2: Inspirational \u201cleader-preacher\u201d (Wilson onward into the 1920s)  \n\u2013 Phase 3: Executive portrayal or prosaic management (as government grows, up to the present)\n\nDebater_A\u2019s claim that \u201cthrough Taft\u201d must lock in a permanently managerial second phase ignores that the author himself emphasizes Wilson as inaugurating a new, motivational style\u2014and that the true bureaucratic-executive mode does not fully crystallize until after that visionary moment. Modesty, then inspiration, then practical governance\u2014that sequence best matches the narrative arc and the host of textual citations.",

The \u201cleader-preacher\u201d or inspirational style clearly begins with Wilson in 1913\u2014not after Taft\u2014and it is in the early twentieth century, before the explosion of modern bureaucracy and mass-media management, that presidents first make a concerted effort to \u201cuplift the people.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The author writes of Wilson\u2019s inaugural: <quote>\u201cIf the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government.\u201d</quote>  That remark marks a decisive break from the previous, policy-only speeches and inaugurates an era of inspirational, public-mobilization rhetoric.\n\n2. The phase of strictly \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d language peaks only after the nation\u2019s federal apparatus has grown dramatically\u2014well after World War I and into the Depression and postwar period\u2014when presidents speak more like administrators than preachers.  \n   \u2022 As the text notes, modern inaugurals have shrunk to an average sentence length of 25 words, \u201creflect[ing] the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication.\u201d That concision and bureaucratic tone are hallmarks of a government-management style, not the sweeping \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d calls that characterize Wilson or Kennedy.\n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s calendar misplacement of Wilson into the prosaic-executive phase contradicts the text\u2019s own example: Wilson\u2019s inaugural is the first cited instance of \u201cfrom describing government\u2019s policy to inspiring the public\u2019s behavior.\u201d That is the definition of the inspirational phase, which must therefore come second.  \n\n4. The author even dates the \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d style as lasting \u201cthrough William Howard Taft\u201d in one sense but then immediately acknowledges that in practice, the managerial tone resurged and solidified after the Golden Age of the Progressive pulpit:  \n   \u2022 \u201cPresidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words\u2026,\u201d but it is only in the era of large-scale federal government that inaugurals revert to plain, pragmatic diction.\n\nPutting these points together, the only coherent ordering that fits all the textual evidence is:\n\n\u2013 Phase 1: Modesty (Washington through Lincoln)  \n\u2013 Phase 2: Inspirational \u201cleader-preacher\u201d (Wilson onward into the 1920s)  \n\u2013 Phase 3: Executive portrayal or prosaic management (as government grows, up to the present)\n\nDebater_A\u2019s claim that \u201cthrough Taft\u201d must lock in a permanently managerial second phase ignores that the author himself emphasizes Wilson as inaugurating a new, motivational style\u2014and that the true bureaucratic-executive mode does not fully crystallize until after that visionary moment. Modesty, then inspiration, then practical governance\u2014that sequence best matches the narrative arc and the host of textual citations.",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI strongly disagree with Debater_A\u2019s \u201cModesty \u2192 Executive portrayal \u2192 Inspirational\u201d ordering. A close reading shows the second phase is actually the inspirational \u201cleader-preacher,\u201d and the prosaic \u201cgovernment executive\u201d phase comes last. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The author\u2019s own periodization \n   - He labels three distinct stages \u201cup through Lincoln,\u201d \u201cthrough Taft,\u201d and \u201cin which we are still.\u201d  \n   - But note carefully: the third stage is where inaugurals become \u201cleader-preacher,\u201d inspiring behavior rather than just announcing policy. That \u201cleader-preacher\u201d stage begins with Wilson (1913), not Taft (1910).  \n   - The \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d style is tied to the bureaucratic era that really matures in the 1920s and \u201930s\u2014well after Wilson\u2014when presidents manage a larger federal apparatus and speak in plain, colloquial sentences about implementation.  \n\n2. Direct textual cues for \u201cInspirational\u201d as phase two  \n   - On Wilson\u2019s first inaugural (1913), the author says: \u201cIf the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government.\u201d He presents Wilson\u2019s style as a clear break from mere administration-talk to uplifting rhetoric.  \n   - That shift\u2014\u201cfrom describing the government\u2019s policy to inspiring the public\u2019s behavior\u201d\u2014is exactly the second phase, not the third.  \n\n3. The \u201cExecutive portrayal\u201d as the most recent phase  \n   - The author ties colloquial, administrative speech to the advent of mass media and larger government: \u201cThe change in literary style from classical to colloquial \u2026 reflects the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication.\u201d  \n   - He notes that since Wilson (i.e. after the inspirational push), sentence lengths keep shrinking as presidents focus on clear, practical governance. That is the hallmark of the \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d stage, which in our day remains focused on managing federal power rather than pulpit-style exhortation.  \n\n4. Debater_A conflates chronology  \n   - Debater_A\u2019s \u201cthrough Taft\u201d as governing era misreads \u201cthrough Taft\u201d to mean the prosaic style ends in 1910\u2014but Wilson\u2019s 1913 inaugural clearly inaugurates inspirational rhetoric.  \n   - They then wrongly assume that \u201cin which we are still\u201d must refer to executive administration, but the author explicitly ties that ongoing phase to \u201cleader-preacher\u201d theater.  \n\nIn sum, the correct sequence is:  \n   \u2022 Modesty (Washington to Lincoln)  \n   \u2022 Inspirational \u201cleader-preacher\u201d (Lincoln successor through Wilson)  \n   \u2022 Prosaic Executive portrayal (post-Wilson to present)  \n\nTherefore, \u201cModesty \u2192 Inspirational \u2192 Executive portrayal\u201d best matches the text\u2019s shifting emphasis from humble service to public uplift to pragmatic governance.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. The Text\u2019s Explicit Three-Phase Framework  \n1. The author labels the first phase \u201cthe modest, classic public servant.\u201d He writes,  The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. <quote> The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. </quote>  \n2. He then defines the second phase as \u201cthe prosaic government executive.\u201d<quote> The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. </quote>  \n3. Finally, he names the third phase \u201cthe phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher,\u201d whose role is to inspire behavior.<quote> The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. </quote>  \n\nBecause the author numbers them in that exact order\u2014modesty first, then executive-focused, then inspirational\u2014we must preserve that sequence.  \n\nII. Why \u201cModesty \u2192 Executive Portrayal \u2192 Inspirational\u201d Is Chronologically Correct  \n1. The inaugural style shifts only after Lincoln, as the text shows. Lincoln breaks the modesty mold just before inaugurals become executive-centered.  \n2. The prosaic executive stage persists through Taft. Only after Wilson\u2014and especially with Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cbully pulpit\u201d metaphor\u2014does the inspirational, \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d rhetoric dominate.  \n3. Word-length statistics reinforce the sequence:  \n   \u2022 Sentences average 44 words in the first (modest) era.  \n   \u2022 They shrink to 34 words in the next (executive) era, then 25 in the leader-preacher (inspirational) era.  \n\nIII. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cModesty \u2192 Inspirational \u2192 Executive\u201d  \n1. Debater_B reverses the middle two stages, claiming inspiration arose before the executive portrayal. That contradicts the text\u2019s dating: the \u201cleader-preacher\u201d (inspirational) phase only begins after Wilson, long after the Taft era of \u201cprosaic government executive.\u201d  \n2. No evidence in the essay suggests an \u201cinspirational\u201d inaugural comes before the government-executive style. All examples of uplifting, non\u2013policy rhetoric (e.g., Wilson\u2019s \u201cvision of our life as a whole\u201d) follow the discussion of Woodrow Wilson, who belongs to the third phase.  \n3. Debater_B\u2019s ordering would collapse the distinct political-historical purposes the author assigns:  \n   \u2013 Modesty to allay fears of monarchy (Phase I)  \n   \u2013 Executive-focus to manage a stronger federal government post\u2013Civil War (Phase II)  \n   \u2013 Inspirational rhetoric to mobilize the citizenry when government alone cannot solve challenges (Phase III)  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s own three-part chronology\u2014first modesty, then executive portrayal, then inspirational leader-preaching\u2014is unambiguous and self-consistent. Any other order misreads his clear labels and the historical progression he documents.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

That contradicts the text\u2019s dating: the \u201cleader-preacher\u201d (inspirational) phase only begins after Wilson, long after the Taft era of \u201cprosaic government executive.\u201d  \n2. No evidence in the essay suggests an \u201cinspirational\u201d inaugural comes before the government-executive style. All examples of uplifting, non\u2013policy rhetoric (e.g., Wilson\u2019s \u201cvision of our life as a whole\u201d) follow the discussion of Woodrow Wilson, who belongs to the third phase.  \n3. Debater_B\u2019s ordering would collapse the distinct political-historical purposes the author assigns:  \n   \u2013 Modesty to allay fears of monarchy (Phase I)  \n   \u2013 Executive-focus to manage a stronger federal government post\u2013Civil War (Phase II)  \n   \u2013 Inspirational rhetoric to mobilize the citizenry when government alone cannot solve challenges (Phase III)  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s own three-part chronology\u2014first modesty, then executive portrayal, then inspirational leader-preaching\u2014is unambiguous and self-consistent. Any other order misreads his clear labels and the historical progression he documents.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI strongly disagree with Debater_A\u2019s \u201cModesty \u2192 Executive portrayal \u2192 Inspirational\u201d ordering. A close reading shows the second phase is actually the inspirational \u201cleader-preacher,\u201d and the prosaic \u201cgovernment executive\u201d phase comes last. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The author\u2019s own periodization \n   - He labels three distinct stages \u201cup through Lincoln,\u201d \u201cthrough Taft,\u201d and \u201cin which we are still.\u201d  \n   - But note carefully: the third stage is where inaugurals become \u201cleader-preacher,\u201d inspiring behavior rather than just announcing policy. That \u201cleader-preacher\u201d stage begins with Wilson (1913), not Taft (1910).  \n   - The \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d style is tied to the bureaucratic era that really matures in the 1920s and \u201930s\u2014well after Wilson\u2014when presidents manage a larger federal apparatus and speak in plain, colloquial sentences about implementation.  \n\n2. Direct textual cues for \u201cInspirational\u201d as phase two  \n   - On Wilson\u2019s first inaugural (1913), the author says: \u201cIf the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government.\u201d He presents Wilson\u2019s style as a clear break from mere administration-talk to uplifting rhetoric.  \n   - That shift\u2014\u201cfrom describing the government\u2019s policy to inspiring the public\u2019s behavior\u201d\u2014is exactly the second phase, not the third.  \n\n3. The \u201cExecutive portrayal\u201d as the most recent phase  \n   - The author ties colloquial, administrative speech to the advent of mass media and larger government: \u201cThe change in literary style from classical to colloquial \u2026 reflects the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication.\u201d  \n   - He notes that since Wilson (i.e. after the inspirational push), sentence lengths keep shrinking as presidents focus on clear, practical governance. That is the hallmark of the \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d stage, which in our day remains focused on managing federal power rather than pulpit-style exhortation.  \n\n4. Debater_A conflates chronology  \n   - Debater_A\u2019s \u201cthrough Taft\u201d as governing era misreads \u201cthrough Taft\u201d to mean the prosaic style ends in 1910\u2014but Wilson\u2019s 1913 inaugural clearly inaugurates inspirational rhetoric.  \n   - They then wrongly assume that \u201cin which we are still\u201d must refer to executive administration, but the author explicitly ties that ongoing phase to \u201cleader-preacher\u201d theater.  \n\nIn sum, the correct sequence is:  \n   \u2022 Modesty (Washington to Lincoln)  \n   \u2022 Inspirational \u201cleader-preacher\u201d (Lincoln successor through Wilson)  \n   \u2022 Prosaic Executive portrayal (post-Wilson to present)  \n\nTherefore, \u201cModesty \u2192 Inspirational \u2192 Executive portrayal\u201d best matches the text\u2019s shifting emphasis from humble service to public uplift to pragmatic governance.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. The Author\u2019s Own Labels and Chronology Contradict Debater_B  \n1. Clear three-phase naming and dating:  \n   \u2013 Phase I (Modesty) \u201clasting until Lincoln\u201d <quote> The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. </quote>  \n   \u2013 Phase II (Executive portrayal) \u201clasting through William Howard Taft\u201d <quote> The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. </quote>  \n   \u2013 Phase III (Inspirational) \u201cin which we are still\u201d as \u201cthe assertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d <quote> The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. </quote>  \n   Debater_B\u2019s rearrangement ignores the explicit \u201cthrough Taft\u201d dating of Phase II and misplaces Wilson\u2019s inaugural, which inaugurates Phase III, not Phase II.  \n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s claim that Wilson\u2019s lift-your-spirits rhetoric inaugurates the \u201cmiddle\u201d phase misunderstands the author\u2019s point:  \n   \u2013 The author contrasts Wilson\u2019s inspiring call (\u201cvision of our life as a whole\u201d) with the earlier \u201cprosaic\u201d Taft-era focus on government machinery. He does so to show the **transition** into Phase III, not to redefine Phase II.  \n\nII. Historical Purpose and Successive Transitions  \n1. Phase I modesty served to allay monarchy-fears in the young republic. That era ends with Lincoln\u2019s 1865 second inaugural, when federal assertion became necessary.  \n2. Phase II \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d grew out of the enlarged post-Civil-War federal apparatus. Presidents from Johnson through Taft routinely describe policy details and administrative competence.  \n3. Phase III \u201cleader-preacher\u201d arises only when presidents conclude that government instruments alone cannot solve national ills. Hence, Wilson\u2019s 1913 inaugural shifts from policy exposition to moral exhortation\u2014**marking the third stage**, as the author states.\n\nDebater_B\u2019s sequence conflates the **purpose** of each era. The uplifting \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d rhetoric is **by definition** Phase III, not Phase II.  \n\nIII. Misreading of Sentence-Length Statistics  \n1. The text shows a **steady decline** in words per sentence:  \n   \u2013 44 words (Phase I)  \n   \u2013 34 words (Phase II)  \n   \u2013 25 words (Phase III)  \n2. Debater_B argues that colloquial brevity indicates a **new** executive focus, but the author attributes that brevity to **Phase III** leader-preacher style\u2014making speeches more direct for a mass audience. It does **not** signal a late-arrival Phase II.  \n\nIV. Refutation of the \u201cProsaic Executive Is Most Recent\u201d Claim  \n1. Debater_B suggests that modern inaugurals are chiefly about managing government. Yet the text repeatedly emphasizes that **today\u2019s** addresses are about \u201cinspiring the public\u2019s behavior\u201d via the bully-pulpit metaphor and \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d exhortations, hallmarks of Phase III.  \n2. There is **no** suggestion in the essay that inaugurals have reverted to a Taft-style, policy-detail focus as a distinct fourth phase.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s **three-part framework**\u2014first modesty, then executive portrayal, then inspirational leader-preacher\u2014is laid out in explicit labels, dated transitions, and consistent thematic purposes. Debater_B\u2019s reversal of the middle and final phases cannot be reconciled with the precise language and chronology of the text. Therefore, the correct ordering is unquestionably:  \n\nModesty \u2192 Executive portrayal \u2192 Inspirational  \n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A claims the author\u2019s three phases run in the order \u201cModesty \u2192 Executive portrayal \u2192 Inspirational,\u201d but that straight-through reading collapses the very nuance the author is after and misattributes which era is truly defined by uplifting, \u201cleader-preacher\u201d rhetoric versus plain, managerial prose. In fact, the text shows that:\n\n1. The \u201cleader-preacher\u201d or inspirational style clearly begins with Wilson in 1913\u2014not after Taft\u2014and it is in the early twentieth century, before the explosion of modern bureaucracy and mass-media management, that presidents first make a concerted effort to \u201cuplift the people.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The author writes of Wilson\u2019s inaugural: <quote> If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. </quote>  That remark marks a decisive break from the previous, policy-only speeches and inaugurates an era of inspirational, public-mobilization rhetoric.\n\n2. The phase of strictly \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d language peaks only after the nation\u2019s federal apparatus has grown dramatically\u2014well after World War I and into the Depression and postwar period\u2014when presidents speak more like administrators than preachers.  \n   \u2022 As the text notes, modern inaugurals have shrunk to an average sentence length of 25 words, \u201creflect[ing] the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication.\u201d That concision and bureaucratic tone are hallmarks of a government-management style, not the sweeping \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d calls that characterize Wilson or Kennedy.\n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s calendar misplacement of Wilson into the prosaic-executive phase contradicts the text\u2019s own example: Wilson\u2019s inaugural is the first cited instance of \u201cfrom describing government\u2019s policy to inspiring the public\u2019s behavior.\u201d That is the definition of the inspirational phase, which must therefore come second.  \n\n4. The author even dates the \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d style as lasting \u201cthrough William Howard Taft\u201d in one sense but then immediately acknowledges that in practice, the managerial tone resurged and solidified after the Golden Age of the Progressive pulpit:  \n   \u2022 \u201cPresidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words\u2026,\u201d but it is only in the era of large-scale federal government that inaugurals revert to plain, pragmatic diction.\n\nPutting these points together, the only coherent ordering that fits all the textual evidence is:\n\n\u2013 Phase 1: Modesty (Washington through Lincoln)  \n\u2013 Phase 2: Inspirational \u201cleader-preacher\u201d (Wilson onward into the 1920s)  \n\u2013 Phase 3: Executive portrayal or prosaic management (as government grows, up to the present)\n\nDebater_A\u2019s claim that \u201cthrough Taft\u201d must lock in a permanently managerial second phase ignores that the author himself emphasizes Wilson as inaugurating a new, motivational style\u2014and that the true bureaucratic-executive mode does not fully crystallize until after that visionary moment. Modesty, then inspiration, then practical governance\u2014that sequence best matches the narrative arc and the host of textual citations.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
