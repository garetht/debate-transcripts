{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 207, "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n", "question": "What does the author think about the state of public political commentary overall?", "first_debater_answer": "That it should remain the same", "second_debater_answer": "That it should be changed to a one person interview format", "debate_identifier": "We Do Understand_What does the author think about the state of public political commentary overall?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think about the state of public political commentary overall?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"That it should be changed to a one person interview format\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"That it should remain the same\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"That it should remain the same\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI argue that the reviewer believes public political commentary is essentially fine as it is\u2014and that Tannen\u2019s prescription to switch to a one-person interview format would be worse, not better. \n\n1. The author repeatedly defends spirited scrutiny as vital to democracy.  \n   \u2022 He praises \u201cthe press corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people\u201d and calls it a \u201cwar on inflation and the press corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people safeguard[ing] the country.\u201d That is, robust debate and challenge are necessary bulwarks against power, not signs of sickness.  \n   \u2022 He objects when Tannen would \u201ccover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate,\u201d because rigorous, adversarial coverage is the engine that keeps democracy honest.  \n\n2. He rejects Tannen\u2019s admiration for Asian one-guest formats.  \n   \u2022 Tannen holds up Japan\u2019s emphasis on group harmony and a single guest rather than multiple debaters. But the reviewer clearly sees this as stifling dissent, writing that Tannen wants \u201cto protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations\u201d and would replace our adversarial norms with \u201cAsian authoritarianism.\u201d That disapproval shows he thinks our multiparty format is preferable.  \n\n3. He insists on separating \u201cthe sphere of snuggle\u201d (family talk, therapy) from \u201cthe sphere of struggle\u201d (politics, law enforcement).  \n   \u2022 In politics\u2014and especially foreign policy or law enforcement\u2014he argues that \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d are essential. Public political commentary is part of that combat: exposing dishonesty, forcing accountability, mobilizing opposition.  \n   \u2022 Tannen\u2019s attempt to erase the sphere of struggle by turning every debate into a therapeutic, feel-good conversation is criticized as na\u00efve and dangerous.  \n\n4. He faults Tannen for failing to trust people\u2019s ability to distinguish lies from truth.  \n   \u2022 By resisting strident critique, she underestimates citizens\u2019 critical faculties. The reviewer thinks the current system\u2014complete with pointed questions, adversarial interviews, and multiple voices\u2014gives the public the raw material needed to make judgments.  \n\nBy contrast, Debater_B\u2019s position\u2014that the author wants to replace multi-guest debate with lone interviews\u2014rests entirely on Tannen\u2019s asides, not on the reviewer\u2019s thrust. The reviewer treats Tannen\u2019s one-person-guest idea as an example of her misguided desire to \u201cfilter out strife,\u201d not as a proposal he endorses. Indeed, he condemns it as an example of the \u201cpaternalistic\u201d impulse to shut down debate.  \n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that the author thinks the state of public political commentary should remain as it is\u2014vigorous, adversarial, pluralistic\u2014and that Tannen\u2019s plea to change it into a one-person interview format is precisely what the reviewer rejects.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s position ignores the author\u2019s repeated warnings about our \u201cargument culture.\u201d  The reviewer shows that today\u2019s public political commentary is riddled with \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock.\u201d  If we \u201cremain the same,\u201d we perpetuate all those ills.  \n\n2. The author explicitly notes Tannen\u2019s proposal to move toward a single-guest format on TV and radio:  \n   <quote> Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" </quote>  \n   That recommendation shows the author wants public commentary changed, not left \u201cthe same.\u201d\n\n3. The purpose of that one-guest format is to reduce spectacle and personal attacks, so that viewers focus on ideas, not on \u201cstrategy, theater, or the opponents\u2019 personal flaws.\u201d  As the reviewer summarizes her broader advice:  \n   \u2022 \u201cFocus on the substance of debates\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cDon\u2019t argue for the sake of arguing\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cDon\u2019t nit-pick other people\u2019s ideas; build your own\u201d  \n   Those principles clash with the current adversarial two-guest shows.\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s claim that the author is satisfied with our present commentary conflates the reviewer\u2019s critique of \u201ccivil discourse\u201d with an endorsement of status quo media.  In fact, the author (via the reviewer) derides modern punditry as a \u201cculture of critique\u201d that has become little more than entertainment.  Retaining that format entrenches bad habits; switching to a one-person interview is precisely the remedy the author favors.\n\n5. Finally, the text offers Asian models\u2014China\u2019s rejection of disputation and Japan\u2019s group-first ethos\u2014not as failed curiosities but as examples we should \u201cconsider\u201d adopting to curb strife.  If \u201cremaining the same\u201d were correct, the reviewer would not have drawn our attention to foreign formats.  \n\nFor all these reasons, the author thinks public political commentary must be changed to a one-person interview format, not left the same.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"That it should remain the same\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Debater A\u2019s case collapses under close scrutiny.

Instead, he pauses to describe Tannen\u2019s antidotes.  \n   \u00ad\u2013 For example, he devotes an entire paragraph to her single-guest proposal:  \n     <quote> Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" </quote>  \n   By embedding that detail in his critique, the reviewer treats it as a serious solution to the toxic spectacle he\u2019s diagnosed.\n\n2.

Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think about the state of public political commentary overall?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"That it should remain the same\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"That it should be changed to a one person interview format\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"That it should be changed to a one person interview format\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s position ignores the author\u2019s repeated warnings about our \u201cargument culture.\u201d  The reviewer shows that today\u2019s public political commentary is riddled with \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock.\u201d  If we \u201cremain the same,\u201d we perpetuate all those ills.  \n\n2. The author explicitly notes Tannen\u2019s proposal to move toward a single-guest format on TV and radio:  \n   <quote> Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" </quote>  \n   That recommendation shows the author wants public commentary changed, not left \u201cthe same.\u201d\n\n3. The purpose of that one-guest format is to reduce spectacle and personal attacks, so that viewers focus on ideas, not on \u201cstrategy, theater, or the opponents\u2019 personal flaws.\u201d  As the reviewer summarizes her broader advice:  \n   \u2022 \u201cFocus on the substance of debates\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cDon\u2019t argue for the sake of arguing\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cDon\u2019t nit-pick other people\u2019s ideas; build your own\u201d  \n   Those principles clash with the current adversarial two-guest shows.\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s claim that the author is satisfied with our present commentary conflates the reviewer\u2019s critique of \u201ccivil discourse\u201d with an endorsement of status quo media.  In fact, the author (via the reviewer) derides modern punditry as a \u201cculture of critique\u201d that has become little more than entertainment.  Retaining that format entrenches bad habits; switching to a one-person interview is precisely the remedy the author favors.\n\n5. Finally, the text offers Asian models\u2014China\u2019s rejection of disputation and Japan\u2019s group-first ethos\u2014not as failed curiosities but as examples we should \u201cconsider\u201d adopting to curb strife.  If \u201cremaining the same\u201d were correct, the reviewer would not have drawn our attention to foreign formats.  \n\nFor all these reasons, the author thinks public political commentary must be changed to a one-person interview format, not left the same.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI argue that the reviewer believes public political commentary is essentially fine as it is\u2014and that Tannen\u2019s prescription to switch to a one-person interview format would be worse, not better. \n\n1. The author repeatedly defends spirited scrutiny as vital to democracy.  \n   \u2022 He praises \u201cthe press corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people\u201d and calls it a \u201cwar on inflation and the press corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people safeguard[ing] the country.\u201d That is, robust debate and challenge are necessary bulwarks against power, not signs of sickness.  \n   \u2022 He objects when Tannen would \u201ccover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate,\u201d because rigorous, adversarial coverage is the engine that keeps democracy honest.  \n\n2. He rejects Tannen\u2019s admiration for Asian one-guest formats.  \n   \u2022 Tannen holds up Japan\u2019s emphasis on group harmony and a single guest rather than multiple debaters. But the reviewer clearly sees this as stifling dissent, writing that Tannen wants \u201cto protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations\u201d and would replace our adversarial norms with \u201cAsian authoritarianism.\u201d That disapproval shows he thinks our multiparty format is preferable.  \n\n3. He insists on separating \u201cthe sphere of snuggle\u201d (family talk, therapy) from \u201cthe sphere of struggle\u201d (politics, law enforcement).  \n   \u2022 In politics\u2014and especially foreign policy or law enforcement\u2014he argues that \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d are essential. Public political commentary is part of that combat: exposing dishonesty, forcing accountability, mobilizing opposition.  \n   \u2022 Tannen\u2019s attempt to erase the sphere of struggle by turning every debate into a therapeutic, feel-good conversation is criticized as na\u00efve and dangerous.  \n\n4. He faults Tannen for failing to trust people\u2019s ability to distinguish lies from truth.  \n   \u2022 By resisting strident critique, she underestimates citizens\u2019 critical faculties. The reviewer thinks the current system\u2014complete with pointed questions, adversarial interviews, and multiple voices\u2014gives the public the raw material needed to make judgments.  \n\nBy contrast, Debater_B\u2019s position\u2014that the author wants to replace multi-guest debate with lone interviews\u2014rests entirely on Tannen\u2019s asides, not on the reviewer\u2019s thrust. The reviewer treats Tannen\u2019s one-person-guest idea as an example of her misguided desire to \u201cfilter out strife,\u201d not as a proposal he endorses. Indeed, he condemns it as an example of the \u201cpaternalistic\u201d impulse to shut down debate.  \n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that the author thinks the state of public political commentary should remain as it is\u2014vigorous, adversarial, pluralistic\u2014and that Tannen\u2019s plea to change it into a one-person interview format is precisely what the reviewer rejects.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"That it should be changed to a one person interview format\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Debater_A\u2019s position ignores the author\u2019s repeated warnings about our \u201cargument culture.\u201d  The reviewer shows that today\u2019s public political commentary is riddled with \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock.\u201d  If we \u201cremain the same,\u201d we perpetuate all those ills.  \n\n2.

Debater_A\u2019s claim that the author is satisfied with our present commentary conflates the reviewer\u2019s critique of \u201ccivil discourse\u201d with an endorsement of status quo media.  In fact, the author (via the reviewer) derides modern punditry as a \u201cculture of critique\u201d that has become little more than entertainment.  Retaining that format entrenches bad habits; switching to a one-person interview is precisely the remedy the author favors.\n\n5. Finally, the text offers Asian models\u2014China\u2019s rejection of disputation and Japan\u2019s group-first ethos\u2014not as failed curiosities but as examples we should \u201cconsider\u201d adopting to curb strife.  If \u201cremaining the same\u201d were correct, the reviewer would not have drawn our attention to foreign formats.  \n\nFor all these reasons, the author thinks public political commentary must be changed to a one-person interview format, not left the same.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s case collapses once you look at what the reviewer actually endorses\u2014and what he condemns as Tannen\u2019s misguided innovations. Here\u2019s why the correct answer is that the author believes our public political commentary should remain as it is, not be reorganized around a one-person interview format.\n\n1. The reviewer explicitly rejects Tannen\u2019s one-guest model as an example of her \u201cpaternalistic\u201d impulse to \u201ccover our ears.\u201d  \n   \u2022 He writes that she \u201cwishes to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate,\u201d offering Asian authoritarian examples as if they were serious alternatives. That framing is clearly pejorative.  \n   \u2022 He calls her Japanese-style one-guest format \u201can example of the \u2018culture of critique\u2019 run amok\u201d and lumps it with the Chinese rejection of disputation\u2014neither of which he endorses.  \n\n2. He praises adversarial scrutiny as the lifeblood of democracy\u2014precisely the opposite of the sterile one-person approach.  \n   \u2022 He lauds \u201cthe press corps\u2019 scrutiny of powerful people\u201d and likens it to a \u201cwar on inflation,\u201d saying that \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d are essential in politics and law enforcement.  \n   \u2022 If the author truly wanted to stifle that \u201ccombat\u201d in favor of lone monologues, he would not have celebrated press adversarialism as a safeguard against tyranny.  \n\n3. Debater_B misreads the list of ills (belligerence, polarization, etc.) that Tannen diagnoses as a comprehensive attack on modern politics, not the author\u2019s own view.  \n   \u2022 The reviewer catalogs Tannen\u2019s laundry list of social ills only to show that she conflates them all under the banner of an \u201cargument culture\u201d she wants to banish.  \n   \u2022 But he never adopts her sweeping condemnation\u2014rather, he faults her for oversimplifying and for failing to distinguish between personal snuggle-talk and necessary political struggle.  \n\n4. The author does not propose importing Japanese or Chinese norms; he cites them only to illustrate how extreme and unworkable Tannen\u2019s prescriptions are.  \n   \u2022 He points out that under French law judges \u201cdo most of the questioning\u201d and people lack cross-examination rights\u2014and he treats that as evidence of how far Tannen would go, not as a model to follow.  \n   \u2022 He never says \u201clet\u2019s emulate France or Japan.\u201d Instead, he underscores the dangers of throttling debate.\n\n5. Finally, the thrust of the review is a defense of our pluralistic, adversarial system against a would-be censorious politics of civility.  \n   \u2022 He condemns Tannen\u2019s desire to filter e-mail, to banish \u201ctitillation, incivility, cruelty,\u201d and to declare certain topics off limits (e.g., \u201cthe view of government as the enemy\u201d).  \n   \u2022 That critique stands or falls only if one believes our existing, robust commentary is a net good\u2014and the reviewer clearly does.\n\nBecause the reviewer consistently praises debate\u2019s adversarial, multi-voice character and treats one-guest formats as symbols of an overprotective, antidemocratic impulse, the correct answer is that he thinks public political commentary should remain as it is\u2014not be changed to a one-person interview format. Debater_B\u2019s theory rests on mistaking Tannen\u2019s caricatured examples for the author\u2019s proposals. In reality, the author defends, rather than revamps, our spirited, pluralistic discourse.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater A\u2019s case collapses under close scrutiny. The reviewer not only relays Tannen\u2019s prescriptions for taming our \u201cargument culture,\u201d he\u2014by choosing which elements to highlight\u2014signals that public commentary must change. Here\u2019s why Debater A is wrong and why I\u2019m right that the author thinks we should switch to a one-person format:\n\n1. The reviewer frames Tannen\u2019s media reforms as remedies, not as misguided quirks.  \n   \u00ad\u2013 He repeatedly catalogs the ills infecting today\u2019s commentary\u2014\u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, \u2026 obstructionism, and gridlock.\u201d If he thought the status quo was fine, he would simply have noted them and moved on. Instead, he pauses to describe Tannen\u2019s antidotes.  \n   \u00ad\u2013 For example, he devotes an entire paragraph to her single-guest proposal:  \n     <quote> Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" </quote>  \n   By embedding that detail in his critique, the reviewer treats it as a serious solution to the toxic spectacle he\u2019s diagnosed.\n\n2. Debater A misreads the reviewer\u2019s defense of \u201cscrutiny\u201d as blanket support for the current format.  \n   \u00ad\u2013 Yes, the reviewer applauds the press\u2019s \u201cwar on inflation\u201d and its role in checking the powerful. But he explicitly distinguishes those substantive investigations from today\u2019s \u201cculture of critique,\u201d which he says too often \u201cjustify[s] the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\u201d  \n   \u00ad\u2013 In other words, he endorses rigorous investigation of genuine malfeasance, not gladiatorial TV shouting matches. A one-guest format preserves hard-hitting interviews while removing theatrics. Debater A conflates these two very different \u201cstruggles.\u201d\n\n3. The reviewer\u2019s own summary of Tannen\u2019s advice applies directly to a one-person show.  \n   \u00ad\u2013 \u201cFocus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents\u2019 personal flaws.\u201d  \n   \u00ad\u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t nit-pick other people\u2019s ideas; build your own.\u201d  \n   \u00ad\u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t argue for the sake of arguing.\u201d  \n   Two-guest panels incentivize spectacle. A single guest forces the host and audience to grapple with ideas, not personalities. The author thinks that shift is essential.\n\n4. Debater A\u2019s \u201csphere of struggle\u201d argument misunderstands the review\u2019s point.  \n   \u00ad\u2013 The reviewer acknowledges there are fights worth having\u2014\u201csome things are worth fighting for\u201d\u2014but he says nothing about keeping the current format. He objects to Tannen only when she would erase *all* struggle, even the just ones. That\u2019s not a call to preserve the status quo; it\u2019s a call to calibrate the struggle. The one-guest model does exactly that: it preserves substantive challenge while eliminating empty combat.\n\n5. The reviewer intentionally flags foreign models as *candidates* for adoption.  \n   \u00ad\u2013 He doesn\u2019t snicker at the Japanese one-guest show as a curiosity; he neutrally introduces it as a format \u201cwe should consider.\u201d If he thought America\u2019s model was optimal, he wouldn\u2019t even mention them.\n\nIn short, Debater A has no textual basis for claiming the author wants to \u201cremain the same.\u201d Everywhere the reviewer spotlights Tannen\u2019s media proposals\u2014above all, her Japanese\u2010style single-guest program\u2014it\u2019s as a means to cure the toxic argument culture he dissects. The clear implication is that public political commentary should indeed *change* to a one-person interview format.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
