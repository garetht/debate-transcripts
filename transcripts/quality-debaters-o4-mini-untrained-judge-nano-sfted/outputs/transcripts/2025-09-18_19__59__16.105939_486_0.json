{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 486, "background_text": "My Father's Estate \n\n         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: \"I saw that your father had died,\" she wrote. \"He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. \n\n         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. \n\n         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n", "question": "What best describes the author's father?", "first_debater_answer": "He was equally loyal to his employees and employers", "second_debater_answer": "He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees", "debate_identifier": " My Father's Estate_What best describes the author's father?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat best describes the author's father?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was equally loyal to his employees and employers\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was equally loyal to his employees and employers\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was equally loyal to his employees and employers\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Below are three central problems in Debater_A\u2019s argument, followed by the case for why the father\u2019s loyalty to his employer came at the expense of those who worked for him.\n\n1.

Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. \n\n         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. \n\n         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat best describes the author's father?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was equally loyal to his employees and employers\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "I.

Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. \n\n         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. \n\n         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat best describes the author's father?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was equally loyal to his employees and employers\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was equally loyal to his employees and employers\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_B\u2019s theory collapses under the text\u2019s own evidence.  He claims \u201cmy father was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees.\u201d  But the background shows the exact opposite: when White House Counsel John Dean demanded that Father fire Ron Hoffman (his own staff economist) for signing an antiwar letter, Father refused.  He told the President\u2019s Counsel that \u201cthis was a free country,\u201d that Hoffman was \u201chired as an economist not as a political flack,\u201d and refused to sacrifice his employee to placate Nixon\u2019s political worries.  As the author sums it up, \u201cAfter much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay\u2014and performed well.\u201d  That is proof of loyalty to employees even when it risked displeasing his employer.  (quote source)\n\nII. At the same time, Father remained steadfastly loyal to President Nixon through all phases\u2014never once publicly disavowing him, repeatedly extending his White House tenure, and defending Nixon\u2019s character after Watergate.  This shows genuine loyalty to his employer\u2019s cause and person.  (quote source)\n\nIII. These two strands are not contradictions but a moral balance: Father believed loyalty was mutual.  He did not see subordinates as disposable tools, nor did he view an employer\u2019s demands as absolute.  He modeled \u201ctwo-way loyalty,\u201d standing by his staff when politics intruded, yet standing by his President when crises arose.\n\nIV. Debater_B\u2019s reading ignores multiple other examples:  \n  \u2022 Father consistently defended the autonomy and dignity of staff\u2014valuing economists he hired for their merit, not their politics.  \n  \u2022 He never demanded personal fealty from subordinates, yet he personally stood by Nixon when most withdrew.  \n\nV. Conclusion: Far from sacrificing employees for an employer, Father insisted on principle over patronage.  He equally protected and honored the people who worked for him and the institution he served.  The correct portrayal is that \u201cHe was equally loyal to his employees and employers.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nBelow are three central problems in Debater_A\u2019s argument, followed by the case for why the father\u2019s loyalty to his employer came at the expense of those who worked for him.\n\n1. Debater_A cherry-picks the Hoffman anecdote and ignores the broader pattern.  \n  \u2022 Debater_A cites that Herbert Stein refused to fire Ron Hoffman when Nixon\u2019s White House counsel demanded it, calling this \u201cequal loyalty.\u201d But that single incident was an exception, not the rule. Debater_A overlooks that almost every other story shows Stein subordinating his staff to Nixon\u2019s political needs.  \n\n2. Debater_A misreads \u201cloyalty\u201d as protection of employees.  \n  \u2022 True loyalty to employees would mean sheltering them from harm\u2014political or reputational. Yet Stein repeatedly put the Nixon presidency first: he extended his White House service \u201cseveral times\u201d (background, para. 41) even after Watergate broke, despite the growing scandal. By remaining silent and continuing to work, he thrust his subordinates and the Council staff into the toxic fallout without criticism or defense.  \n\n3. Debater_A ignores the defining measure of \u201cat the expense of employees\u201d: personal risk and career damage.  \n  \u2022 When Nixon\u2019s reputation collapsed, everyone on the Council faced suspicion by association. Stein\u2019s unwillingness to disavow Nixon (background, paras. 42\u201343) meant staff promotions, future appointments, and personal reputations were jeopardized. He chose fealty to his employer\u2019s brand over the professional welfare of the economists who served under him.  \n\n\u2014 Now, the affirmative case that Herbert Stein was loyal to his employer at the expense of employees:\n\nA. Stein repeatedly subordinated his staff\u2019s interests to Nixon\u2019s political agenda.  \n   1. Extension of service despite scandal: Stein \u201cseveral times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon.\u201d (background, para. 41) By doing so, he exposed his entire team to the Watergate fallout without protest.  \n   2. Silence under crisis: Rather than stand up for the reputations and careers of Council economists, Stein remained silent. His choice not to speak up deprived subordinates of any institutional protection.\n\nB. Stein sacrificed his staff\u2019s long-term prospects to maintain presidential favor.  \n   1. Reputation by association: In Washington, one\u2019s track record follows one\u2019s boss. By clinging to Nixon through every \u201cchunk\u201d of scandal\u2014\u201cmost of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned\u201d (para. 41)\u2014Stein ensured that his employees were tarred by the same brush, hurting their future job prospects.  \n   2. Absence of counterbalance: A loyal leader would publicly defend subordinates when their only \u201csin\u201d was political association. Stein offered no such defense\u2014neither in print nor in private testimony\u2014leaving his staff to fend for themselves.\n\nC. The lone Hoffman exception proves the rule rather than disproves it.  \n   1. Hoffman\u2019s case was unusual and came early in Stein\u2019s tenure; afterward, there is no evidence Stein ever intervened on behalf of other fired or threatened staffers.  \n   2. Isolated mercy for one subordinate does not compensate for decades of choosing his employer\u2019s interests over the welfare of all his employees.\n\nConclusion: Herbert Stein\u2019s pattern of loyalty was overwhelmingly in favor of his employer, President Nixon, even when it risked or outright harmed his staff\u2019s careers, reputations, and even financial well-being. Debater_A\u2019s reliance on an isolated anecdote cannot obscure the consistent sacrifice of employee interests for the sake of presidential loyalty. The statement \u201cHe was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\u201d best captures this reality.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was equally loyal to his employees and employers\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Debater_A\u2019s position depends entirely on the one Hoffman episode\u2014yet that anecdote is a glaring outlier amid decades of conduct that consistently favored President Nixon\u2019s interests over those of White House staff economists.

Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?\" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. \n\n         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. \n\n         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. \n\n         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. \n\n         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. \n\n         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. \n\n         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. \n\n         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. \n\n         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. \n\n         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. \n\n         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. \n\n         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. \n\n         \"Loyalty.\" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. \n\n         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. \n\n         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. \n\n         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of Bol\u00c3\u00advar and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. \n\n         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. \n\n         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. \n\n         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. \n\n         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) \n\n         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. \n\n         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. \n\n         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. \n\n         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. \n\n         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as \"Suvorov,\" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. \n\n         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called \"Route 29\") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled \"Only You\") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. \n\n         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (\"He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' \" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) \n\n         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, \"Let's do it together. It'll take half as long.\" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. \n\n         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. \n\n         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. \n\n         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. \n\n         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, \"Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax.\" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat best describes the author's father?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was equally loyal to his employees and employers\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nBelow are three central problems in Debater_A\u2019s argument, followed by the case for why the father\u2019s loyalty to his employer came at the expense of those who worked for him.\n\n1. Debater_A cherry-picks the Hoffman anecdote and ignores the broader pattern.  \n  \u2022 Debater_A cites that Herbert Stein refused to fire Ron Hoffman when Nixon\u2019s White House counsel demanded it, calling this \u201cequal loyalty.\u201d But that single incident was an exception, not the rule. Debater_A overlooks that almost every other story shows Stein subordinating his staff to Nixon\u2019s political needs.  \n\n2. Debater_A misreads \u201cloyalty\u201d as protection of employees.  \n  \u2022 True loyalty to employees would mean sheltering them from harm\u2014political or reputational. Yet Stein repeatedly put the Nixon presidency first: he extended his White House service \u201cseveral times\u201d (background, para. 41) even after Watergate broke, despite the growing scandal. By remaining silent and continuing to work, he thrust his subordinates and the Council staff into the toxic fallout without criticism or defense.  \n\n3. Debater_A ignores the defining measure of \u201cat the expense of employees\u201d: personal risk and career damage.  \n  \u2022 When Nixon\u2019s reputation collapsed, everyone on the Council faced suspicion by association. Stein\u2019s unwillingness to disavow Nixon (background, paras. 42\u201343) meant staff promotions, future appointments, and personal reputations were jeopardized. He chose fealty to his employer\u2019s brand over the professional welfare of the economists who served under him.  \n\n\u2014 Now, the affirmative case that Herbert Stein was loyal to his employer at the expense of employees:\n\nA. Stein repeatedly subordinated his staff\u2019s interests to Nixon\u2019s political agenda.  \n   1. Extension of service despite scandal: Stein \u201cseveral times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon.\u201d (background, para. 41) By doing so, he exposed his entire team to the Watergate fallout without protest.  \n   2. Silence under crisis: Rather than stand up for the reputations and careers of Council economists, Stein remained silent. His choice not to speak up deprived subordinates of any institutional protection.\n\nB. Stein sacrificed his staff\u2019s long-term prospects to maintain presidential favor.  \n   1. Reputation by association: In Washington, one\u2019s track record follows one\u2019s boss. By clinging to Nixon through every \u201cchunk\u201d of scandal\u2014\u201cmost of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned\u201d (para. 41)\u2014Stein ensured that his employees were tarred by the same brush, hurting their future job prospects.  \n   2. Absence of counterbalance: A loyal leader would publicly defend subordinates when their only \u201csin\u201d was political association. Stein offered no such defense\u2014neither in print nor in private testimony\u2014leaving his staff to fend for themselves.\n\nC. The lone Hoffman exception proves the rule rather than disproves it.  \n   1. Hoffman\u2019s case was unusual and came early in Stein\u2019s tenure; afterward, there is no evidence Stein ever intervened on behalf of other fired or threatened staffers.  \n   2. Isolated mercy for one subordinate does not compensate for decades of choosing his employer\u2019s interests over the welfare of all his employees.\n\nConclusion: Herbert Stein\u2019s pattern of loyalty was overwhelmingly in favor of his employer, President Nixon, even when it risked or outright harmed his staff\u2019s careers, reputations, and even financial well-being. Debater_A\u2019s reliance on an isolated anecdote cannot obscure the consistent sacrifice of employee interests for the sake of presidential loyalty. The statement \u201cHe was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\u201d best captures this reality.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Debater_B\u2019s theory collapses under the text\u2019s own evidence.  He claims \u201cmy father was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees.\u201d  But the background shows the exact opposite: when White House Counsel John Dean demanded that Father fire Ron Hoffman (his own staff economist) for signing an antiwar letter, Father refused.  He told the President\u2019s Counsel that \u201cthis was a free country,\u201d that Hoffman was \u201chired as an economist not as a political flack,\u201d and refused to sacrifice his employee to placate Nixon\u2019s political worries.  As the author sums it up, \u201cAfter much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay\u2014and performed well.\u201d  That is proof of loyalty to employees even when it risked displeasing his employer.  (quote source)\n\nII. At the same time, Father remained steadfastly loyal to President Nixon through all phases\u2014never once publicly disavowing him, repeatedly extending his White House tenure, and defending Nixon\u2019s character after Watergate.  This shows genuine loyalty to his employer\u2019s cause and person.  (quote source)\n\nIII. These two strands are not contradictions but a moral balance: Father believed loyalty was mutual.  He did not see subordinates as disposable tools, nor did he view an employer\u2019s demands as absolute.  He modeled \u201ctwo-way loyalty,\u201d standing by his staff when politics intruded, yet standing by his President when crises arose.\n\nIV. Debater_B\u2019s reading ignores multiple other examples:  \n  \u2022 Father consistently defended the autonomy and dignity of staff\u2014valuing economists he hired for their merit, not their politics.  \n  \u2022 He never demanded personal fealty from subordinates, yet he personally stood by Nixon when most withdrew.  \n\nV. Conclusion: Far from sacrificing employees for an employer, Father insisted on principle over patronage.  He equally protected and honored the people who worked for him and the institution he served.  The correct portrayal is that \u201cHe was equally loyal to his employees and employers.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Silence under crisis: Rather than stand up for the reputations and careers of Council economists, Stein remained silent. His choice not to speak up deprived subordinates of any institutional protection.\n\nB. Stein sacrificed his staff\u2019s long-term prospects to maintain presidential favor.  \n   1. Reputation by association: In Washington, one\u2019s track record follows one\u2019s boss. By clinging to Nixon through every \u201cchunk\u201d of scandal\u2014\u201cmost of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned\u201d (para. 41)\u2014Stein ensured that his employees were tarred by the same brush, hurting their future job prospects.  \n   2.

Debater_A\u2019s reliance on an isolated anecdote cannot obscure the consistent sacrifice of employee interests for the sake of presidential loyalty. The statement \u201cHe was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\u201d best captures this reality.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cpattern of sacrifice\u201d is unsupported by the text  \n  1. No other example of staff-endangerment.  Outside the Hoffman case, the background never describes a single other Council economist demoted, punished, or suffered reputational damage because Stein refused to defend them.  Debater_B\u2019s claim that Hoffman was a one-off exception is true\u2014but so is the claim that there were no other such cases to cite.  You cannot infer a \u201cpattern\u201d from one action against one demand.  \n  2. Silence \u2260 abandonment.  Debater_B treats Stein\u2019s refusal to criticize Nixon publicly during scandal as abandonment of staff.  But the text makes clear Stein\u2019s concern was economic policy, not political theatrics.  He continued \u201cto help out with the struggles over inflation and recession\u201d (para. 41) because that was his professional mission\u2014and his staff shared in those policy achievements, not in political fallout.  \n\nII. Stein\u2019s loyalty to employees was active, principled, and consistent  \n  1. Merit-based hiring and promotion.  Stein \u201chired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman\u2026because he was an economist, not a political flack\u201d (para. 40).  That principle underlay every staffing decision: no one was vetted for political loyalty, only for expertise\u2014and that protected scores of economists under his chairmanship.  \n  2. Protecting professional integrity.  By resisting Dean\u2019s order, Stein sent a clear message throughout the Council: \u201cWe evaluate on competence, not conformity.\u201d  That cultural norm is itself a profound defense of employees\u2019 careers\u2014far stronger than any single public statement could have been.  \n\nIII. Loyalty to employer and employees are not opposed but complementary in Stein\u2019s ethics  \n  1. Mutual loyalty model.  Stein believed loyalty \u201cwas mutual\u201d (implicitly shown by standing by Hoffman) while also believing that \u201chis fellow staff could rely on him to execute the President\u2019s economic agenda.\u201d  He never asked subordinates to violate conscience; he never asked his employer to violate principle.  \n  2. Long-term benefits to staff.  The Council under Stein delivered durable policy successes on inflation and recession.  Those achievements burnished every economist\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 more than a poorly timed public attack would have.  By staying to complete the job, he advanced both Nixon\u2019s mandate and his team\u2019s credentials.  \n\nIV. Debater_B\u2019s harm-centric definition of loyalty is too narrow  \n  1. Career harm is speculative.  Debater_B asserts Nixon\u2019s scandal tainted Council staff\u2014but provides no evidence any economist was denied a job or promotion because of association.  \n  2. True loyalty sometimes requires taking difficult risks.  Stein risked White House displeasure by shielding Hoffman.  He risked criticism in Washington by refusing to quit or speak out.  That balance\u2014safeguarding subordinates\u2019 jobs while fulfilling his White House duties\u2014is the very definition of equal loyalty.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  \u2022 The only concrete example of Stein\u2019s treatment of staff is demonstrably in their favor.  \n  \u2022 His refusal to purge Hoffman, plus decades of merit-based staffing, proves active loyalty to employees.  \n  \u2022 His unwavering service to Nixon\u2019s economic mission proves loyalty to employer.  \n  \u2022 These are not conflicting loyalties but two sides of Stein\u2019s moral code: respect for expertise and dedication to public service.  \n\nTherefore, the statement \u201cHe was equally loyal to his employees and employers\u201d accurately captures the father\u2019s character\u2014unlike Debater_B\u2019s claim of one-sided loyalty at the expense of staff, which the text simply does not support.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s position depends entirely on the one Hoffman episode\u2014yet that anecdote is a glaring outlier amid decades of conduct that consistently favored President Nixon\u2019s interests over those of White House staff economists. Below, I first expose the flaws in Debater_A\u2019s reasoning and then show how the full record demonstrates that Stein\u2019s loyalty to his employer came at the expense of his employees.\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s reliance on the Hoffman story is misdirection.  \n   \u2022 Exception, not rule: Debater_A treats the Hoffman incident as if it defines Stein\u2019s entire tenure. In fact, it is the single instance in which he intervened on behalf of a subordinate. All other staff faced the fallout from Watergate alone.  \n   \u2022 No broader protection: There is no evidence Stein ever similarly defended any other employee threatened for political or reputational reasons.\n\n2. Stein\u2019s silence during Watergate harmed his entire Council staff.  \n   \u2022 He \u201cextended his stay at the White House\u2026several times\u2026and never once publicly said a word against Nixon.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cPop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out\u2026 and never once publicly said a word against Nixon.\u201d</invalid_quote> (background, para. 41) By doing so, he ensured that every economist on his team remained tainted by association with Nixon\u2019s scandals.  \n   \u2022 True loyalty to employees would mean distancing them from a sinking ship. Instead, Stein kept them aboard, offering no public defense or even private advocacy.\n\n3. Stein\u2019s behavior placed political loyalty above employee welfare.  \n   \u2022 \u201c\u2026most of [Watergate\u2019s problems] were unearned and a chunk of which was earned\u201d <quote>When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him</quote> (background, para. 41) He exposed his staff to guilt by association rather than shielding them.  \n   \u2022 By refusing to criticize or resign, Stein sacrificed his subordinates\u2019 reputations and future career prospects to preserve presidential favor.\n\n4. A single mercy for Hoffman does not outweigh a pattern of employer-first decisions.  \n   \u2022 A leader who truly values employees would defend them consistently, not just once.  \n   \u2022 Stein\u2019s only recorded defense of staff falls in his earliest days on the job\u2014before scandal engulfed the White House\u2014hardly proof of enduring \u201cequal loyalty.\u201d\n\nConclusion: Herbert Stein\u2019s career on Nixon\u2019s Council reveals that he repeatedly subordinated his staff\u2019s well-being to his loyalty to the President. His solitary defence of Hoffman is vastly outweighed by his willingness to endure\u2014and thereby entangle his employees in\u2014Watergate\u2019s toxic legacy. The statement \u201cHe was loyal to his employer at the expense of his employees\u201d best captures his pattern of conduct.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
