    "background_text": "Folie \u080e \n\n         People with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n",

He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

      "content": "I. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s Key Claims  \n1. \u201cWent crazy at age 30\u201d is a milestone, not true onset  \n   \u2022 The phrase <quote> went crazy at the age of 30 </quote> marks the first full-blown psychotic breakdown, but it does not imply that Nash\u2019s mental instability began only then. Clinical schizophrenia often follows years of sub-threshold symptoms\u2014precisely what we see in Nash\u2019s youth.  \n2. Childhood cruelty and risk-taking are not mere delinquency  \n   \u2022 Debater_B insists that animal torture and bomb-making aren\u2019t psychiatric. Yet the text says Nash \u201cenjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed.\u201d Such sadistic behavior in childhood is a well-documented prodrome of severe personality disturbance and psychosis, not simply youthful mischief.  \n3. Later \u201cimprovement\u201d is remission, not evidence of adult onset  \n   \u2022 Schizophrenia may wax and wane over decades. The fact that \u201cthe voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d in the \u201990s (<quote>Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down.</quote>) shows remission, not a newfound sanity after a purely adult-onset illness.  \n\nII. Positive Case for Lifelong Madness Coexisting with Genius  \n1. Early-life pleiotropy of \u201cmadness\u201d and mathematical talent  \n   \u2022 The book opens by comparing nearsightedness and high IQ\u2014an accidental genetic link called pleiotropy. By analogy, \u201cthe same genes that tend to elevate IQ\u201d likely predisposed Nash to mental instability <quote> Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? </quote>. This suggests an inborn vulnerability to psychosis that accompanied his genius from the start.  \n2. Subclinical symptoms throughout youth and early adulthood  \n   \u2022 Obsessive, delusional-tinged interests: long before age 30, Nash \u201cshowed an intense interest in the state of Israel\u2014often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Public bizarre behavior predating the breakdown: he \u201cshowed up for an MIT New Year\u2019s Eve party clad only in a diaper,\u201d a classic hallucination-powered exhibitionism rather than mere prank.  \n3. Monumental achievements amid ongoing instability  \n   \u2022 Princeton breakthrough: Within two years of arriving at Princeton Nash \u201cframed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games,\u201d even as his peculiarities mounted.  \n   \u2022 Riemannian manifold result: He \u201cdisposed of a deep problem \u2026 by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities,\u201d befuddling colleagues\u2014proof that his mental quirks and mathematical creativity were inseparable.  \n\nIII. Why Debater_B\u2019s \u201cAdult-Onset\u201d Framing Fails  \n1. Conflating a psychotic episode with disease origin  \n   \u2022 Pointing to the first hospitalization at 30 ignores a decade of \u201ceccentric\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d conduct that the text repeatedly flags as pathological.  \n2. Misreading remission as recovery from adult-only illness  \n   \u2022 Late-life quieting of voices is typical of schizophrenia\u2019s chronic-relapsing course; it does not imply he was \u201cnormal\u201d until age 30.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nAll evidence points to John Nash\u2019s mental instability as an ingrained trait\u2014evident in childhood cruelty, adolescent bomb-making, early delusional fixations, and bizarre public acts\u2014running in parallel with his mathematical genius. His landmark achievements did not await adulthood-only sanity, nor did his supposed \u201conset\u201d at 30 mark the birth of his madness. The correct interpretation is: \u201cHe was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway.\u201d",

Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s Key Claims  \n1. \u201cWent crazy at age 30\u201d is a milestone, not true onset  \n   \u2022 The phrase <quote>\u201cwent crazy at the age of 30\u201d</quote> marks the first full-blown psychotic breakdown, but it does not imply that Nash\u2019s mental instability began only then. Clinical schizophrenia often follows years of sub-threshold symptoms\u2014precisely what we see in Nash\u2019s youth.  \n2. Childhood cruelty and risk-taking are not mere delinquency  \n   \u2022 Debater_B insists that animal torture and bomb-making aren\u2019t psychiatric. Yet the text says Nash \u201cenjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed.\u201d Such sadistic behavior in childhood is a well-documented prodrome of severe personality disturbance and psychosis, not simply youthful mischief.  \n3. Later \u201cimprovement\u201d is remission, not evidence of adult onset  \n   \u2022 Schizophrenia may wax and wane over decades. The fact that \u201cthe voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d in the \u201990s (<quote>Then, in the \u201990s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down.</quote>) shows remission, not a newfound sanity after a purely adult-onset illness.  \n\nII. Positive Case for Lifelong Madness Coexisting with Genius  \n1. Early-life pleiotropy of \u201cmadness\u201d and mathematical talent  \n   \u2022 The book opens by comparing nearsightedness and high IQ\u2014an accidental genetic link called pleiotropy. By analogy, \u201cthe same genes that tend to elevate IQ\u201d likely predisposed Nash to mental instability <quote>\u201cCould there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?\u201d</quote>. This suggests an inborn vulnerability to psychosis that accompanied his genius from the start.  \n2. Subclinical symptoms throughout youth and early adulthood  \n   \u2022 Obsessive, delusional-tinged interests: long before age 30, Nash \u201cshowed an intense interest in the state of Israel\u2014often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Public bizarre behavior predating the breakdown: he \u201cshowed up for an MIT New Year\u2019s Eve party clad only in a diaper,\u201d a classic hallucination-powered exhibitionism rather than mere prank.  \n3. Monumental achievements amid ongoing instability  \n   \u2022 Princeton breakthrough: Within two years of arriving at Princeton Nash \u201cframed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games,\u201d even as his peculiarities mounted.  \n   \u2022 Riemannian manifold result: He \u201cdisposed of a deep problem \u2026 by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities,\u201d befuddling colleagues\u2014proof that his mental quirks and mathematical creativity were inseparable.  \n\nIII. Why Debater_B\u2019s \u201cAdult-Onset\u201d Framing Fails  \n1. Conflating a psychotic episode with disease origin  \n   \u2022 Pointing to the first hospitalization at 30 ignores a decade of \u201ceccentric\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d conduct that the text repeatedly flags as pathological.  \n2. Misreading remission as recovery from adult-only illness  \n   \u2022 Late-life quieting of voices is typical of schizophrenia\u2019s chronic-relapsing course; it does not imply he was \u201cnormal\u201d until age 30.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nAll evidence points to John Nash\u2019s mental instability as an ingrained trait\u2014evident in childhood cruelty, adolescent bomb-making, early delusional fixations, and bizarre public acts\u2014running in parallel with his mathematical genius. His landmark achievements did not await adulthood-only sanity, nor did his supposed \u201conset\u201d at 30 mark the birth of his madness. The correct interpretation is: \u201cHe was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway.\u201d",

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about the subject of the book the author read?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI will show that the text portrays Nash not as a man who only \u201cdeveloped\u201d madness in adulthood, but as someone whose odd, even cruel, behavior\u2014and underlying mental instability\u2014was evident from childhood, long before his 30s breakdown. At the same time, it chronicles his extraordinary mathematical achievements.  \n\n1. Early signs of pathology long before age thirty  \n   \u2022 Childhood cruelty: \u201cAs a boy \u2026 Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 That is not normal adolescent mischief\u2014it signals deep-seated pathology.  \n   \u2022 Teenage risk taking: Experimenting with explosives that killed a friend shows reckless, antisocial impulses rooted in his youth.  \n\n2. Pervasive eccentricity predating his \u201cbreakdown\u201d  \n   \u2022 Strange obsessions: Long before his formal diagnosis, Nash \u201cshowed an intense interest in the state of Israel\u2014often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew.\u201d (background)  \n   \u2022 Public disrobing: \u201cGeniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public \u2026 Nash showed up for an MIT New Year\u2019s Eve party clad only in a diaper.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 These bizarre acts did not suddenly begin at age 30\u2014they were part of his pattern in early adulthood.  \n\n3. Mathematical genius coexisting with lifelong mental instability  \n   \u2022 Early Princeton triumph: \u201cWithin two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games.\u201d (background)  \n   \u2022 Profound contributions amid personal chaos: While displaying odd and cruel behavior even as a teacher\u2014humiliating students, marital violence\u2014he still \u201cdisposed of a deep problem \u2026 any Riemannian manifold \u2026 can be embedded in Euclidean space.\u201d (background)  \n\n4. Flaw in Debater_B\u2019s thesis  \n   Debater_B claims Nash \u201cdeveloped mental illness as an adult but later improved,\u201d implying a clean slate until 30. That directly contradicts the text\u2019s numerous pre-30 incidents:  \n   \u2022 Animal torture and bomb-making are not adult-onset psychosis but early antisocial and possibly schizoid traits.  \n   \u2022 Public indecency and delusional obsessions about Israel occurred in his twenties, before his famous \u201cbreakdown.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nThe background clearly depicts Nash as someone with deep-rooted, lifelong mental disturbance\u2014present from boyhood\u2014who nonetheless accomplished landmark work in mathematics and economics. Therefore, the correct interpretation is \u201cHe was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBorn Crazy\u201d Thesis  \n1. No childhood psychosis described  \n   \u2013 The background text paints Nash\u2019s childhood as troubled\u2014animal torture, homemade bombs\u2014but never mentions hallucinations, delusions, or other clinical signs of schizophrenia before age thirty. Debater_A\u2019s claim of innate craziness relies on conflating antisocial or violent behavior with psychosis, but these are distinct.  \n2. Onset at thirty is explicit  \n   \u2013 The text states that John Nash \u201cwent crazy at the age of 30\u201d (<quote> Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 a</quote>). That pinpoints adult onset, not congenital madness.  \n3. Improvement after decades of illness  \n   \u2013 Nash\u2019s case is notable for a late-life remission: \u201cin the \u201990s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d (<quote>Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down.</quote>). A person born crazy could not so clearly \u201cimprove\u201d decades later; improvement after adult-onset schizophrenia underscores that the illness arose in adulthood.  \n\nII. Positive Case for \u201cDeveloped Mental Illness as an Adult but Later Improved\u201d  \n1. Adult-onset schizophrenia is well documented  \n   \u2013 The text chronicles Nash\u2019s dramatic breakdown in 1959, at roughly age thirty, culminating in \u201cthree decades of raging schizophrenia\u201d in hospitals and asylums. That timeline confirms adult development.  \n2. Distinct phases\u2014genius, madness, remission  \n   \u2013 Nash\u2019s life divides cleanly into a pre-illness phase of prodigious mathematical work at Princeton and RAND, a middle phase of florid psychosis (stints in asylums, public disrobing, delusions of alien messages), and a late phase of recovery culminating in Nobel recognition. Such a triphasic progression is characteristic of adult-onset schizophrenia followed by remission.  \n3. Evidence of genuine improvement  \n   \u2013 The \u201cvery fine person\u201d he became after the Nobel, living humbly with his son and managing daily life, illustrates true recovery (<quote> Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--</quote>)\u2014not merely masking congenital craziness.  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Main Points  \n1. Childhood cruelty \u2260 psychosis  \n   \u2013 Debater_A misreads violent or antisocial conduct as evidence of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is defined by hallucinations, delusions, disordered thought\u2014not by cruelty or risk-taking.  \n2. No proof of lifelong madness  \n   \u2013 If Nash had been \u201cborn crazy,\u201d the text would have noted early psychiatric symptoms; instead it emphasizes academic brilliance through his twenties without hint of mental illness.  \n3. Improvement invalidates congenital theory  \n   \u2013 Congenital mental illness, especially schizophrenia, rarely yields spontaneous remission after decades. Nash\u2019s unusual improvement in the 1990s, confirmed by multiple sources in the text, argues strongly for an illness that arose later and then partially resolved\u2014not a lifelong condition.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe text unambiguously locates Nash\u2019s psychosis onset in adulthood\u2014around age thirty\u2014and details a significant remission decades later. There is no textual support for the notion that he was \u201cborn crazy.\u201d Thus, the correct interpretation is that John Nash developed mental illness as an adult but later improved.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Childhood cruelty \u2260 psychosis  \n   \u2013 Nash\u2019s \u201ctorturing animals and building homemade bombs\u201d describes antisocial or violent behavior, not the core symptoms of schizophrenia (hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thought). The text never ascribes any clinical psychotic symptoms to his youth.  \n2. Eccentric interests aren\u2019t delusions  \n   \u2013 An \u201cintense interest in the state of Israel\u201d (<quote>as showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew.</quote>) may be odd, but it isn\u2019t a fixed, false belief held despite clear evidence to the contrary. The text explicitly ties his first \u201ccrazy\u201d episode\u2014and its onset of full-blown schizophrenia\u2014to age thirty.  \n\nII. Onset of Full-Blown Psychosis at Age Thirty  \n1. Textual timestamp  \n   \u2013 \u201cwent crazy at the age of 30\u201d (<quote>Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30</quote>). That is the narrator\u2019s clear marker of when clinical insanity set in.  \n2. Pre-30 achievements without psychosis  \n   \u2013 Up through his Princeton breakthrough and his work at RAND, Nash exhibits brilliance and only socially atypical behavior\u2014not psychotic episodes. If he\u2019d been \u201ccrazy\u201d from birth, the text would have signaled early hallucinations or delusions, but it does not.  \n\nIII. Evidence of Significant Remission  \n1. Late-life improvement defies congenital theory  \n   \u2013 \u201cThen, in the \u201990s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d (<quote>Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down.</quote>)\u2014a genuine remission after decades of schizophrenia, which is extraordinarily rare.  \n2. Transformation into a \u201cvery fine person\u201d  \n   \u2013 Post-Nobel, Nash \u201cevolved into a \u2018very fine person,\u2019\u201d resuming stable family life and modest living (<quote>Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife</quote>). Such recovery from an adult-onset psychosis is incompatible with lifelong congenital madness.  \n\nIV. Why Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBorn Crazy\u201d Thesis Fails  \n1. No textual support for childhood psychosis  \n   \u2013 All early anecdotes\u2014animal cruelty, bomb-making\u2014are behavioral or moral deviations, not psychiatric symptoms.  \n2. Premature labeling of eccentricity as insanity  \n   \u2013 Public disrobing at an MIT party is presented as part of his breakdown phase, but even Debater_A cites it without proof it preceded age thirty. The text groups these acts with his later \u201craging schizophrenia.\u201d  \n3. Lifespan tripartition confirms adult-onset model  \n   \u2013 The narrative clearly divides into three phases: early genius (no clinical madness), middle madness (age 30\u201360), late remission (1990s onward). There is no fourth phase \u201ccongenital madness.\u201d  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe background explicitly dates Nash\u2019s psychotic break to age thirty, records three decades of schizophrenia, then describes a remarkable remission. There is no indication of clinical psychosis in childhood\u2014only destructive or eccentric behavior, which is not schizophrenia. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that he developed mental illness as an adult but later improved.",

Eccentric interests aren\u2019t delusions  \n   \u2013 An \u201cintense interest in the state of Israel\u201d (<quote>He showed an intense interest in the state of Israel\u2014often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew.</quote>) may be odd, but it isn\u2019t a fixed, false belief held despite clear evidence to the contrary. The text explicitly ties his first \u201ccrazy\u201d episode\u2014and its onset of full-blown schizophrenia\u2014to age thirty.  \n\nII. Onset of Full-Blown Psychosis at Age Thirty  \n1. Textual timestamp  \n   \u2013 \u201cwent crazy at the age of 30\u201d (<quote>Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30</quote>). That is the narrator\u2019s clear marker of when clinical insanity set in.  \n2. Pre-30 achievements without psychosis  \n   \u2013 Up through his Princeton breakthrough and his work at RAND, Nash exhibits brilliance and only socially atypical behavior\u2014not psychotic episodes. If he\u2019d been \u201ccrazy\u201d from birth, the text would have signaled early hallucinations or delusions, but it does not.  \n\nIII. Evidence of Significant Remission  \n1. Late-life improvement defies congenital theory  \n   \u2013 \u201cThen, in the \u201990s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d (<quote>Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down.</quote>)\u2014a genuine remission after decades of schizophrenia, which is extraordinarily rare.  \n2. Transformation into a \u201cvery fine person\u201d  \n   \u2013 Post-Nobel, Nash \u201cevolved into a \u2018very fine person,\u2019\u201d resuming stable family life and modest living (<quote>Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife</quote>). Such recovery from an adult-onset psychosis is incompatible with lifelong congenital madness.  \n\nIV. Why Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBorn Crazy\u201d Thesis Fails  \n1. No textual support for childhood psychosis  \n   \u2013 All early anecdotes\u2014animal cruelty, bomb-making\u2014are behavioral or moral deviations, not psychiatric symptoms.  \n2. Premature labeling of eccentricity as insanity  \n   \u2013 Public disrobing at an MIT party is presented as part of his breakdown phase, but even Debater_A cites it without proof it preceded age thirty. The text groups these acts with his later \u201craging schizophrenia.\u201d  \n3. Lifespan tripartition confirms adult-onset model  \n   \u2013 The narrative clearly divides into three phases: early genius (no clinical madness), middle madness (age 30\u201360), late remission (1990s onward). There is no fourth phase \u201ccongenital madness.\u201d  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe background explicitly dates Nash\u2019s psychotic break to age thirty, records three decades of schizophrenia, then describes a remarkable remission. There is no indication of clinical psychosis in childhood\u2014only destructive or eccentric behavior, which is not schizophrenia. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that he developed mental illness as an adult but later improved.",

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about the subject of the book the author read?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBorn Crazy\u201d Thesis  \n1. No childhood psychosis described  \n   \u2013 The background text paints Nash\u2019s childhood as troubled\u2014animal torture, homemade bombs\u2014but never mentions hallucinations, delusions, or other clinical signs of schizophrenia before age thirty. Debater_A\u2019s claim of innate craziness relies on conflating antisocial or violent behavior with psychosis, but these are distinct.  \n2. Onset at thirty is explicit  \n   \u2013 The text states that John Nash \u201cwent crazy at the age of 30\u201d (<quote> Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 a</quote>). That pinpoints adult onset, not congenital madness.  \n3. Improvement after decades of illness  \n   \u2013 Nash\u2019s case is notable for a late-life remission: \u201cin the \u201990s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d (<quote>Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down.</quote>). A person born crazy could not so clearly \u201cimprove\u201d decades later; improvement after adult-onset schizophrenia underscores that the illness arose in adulthood.  \n\nII. Positive Case for \u201cDeveloped Mental Illness as an Adult but Later Improved\u201d  \n1. Adult-onset schizophrenia is well documented  \n   \u2013 The text chronicles Nash\u2019s dramatic breakdown in 1959, at roughly age thirty, culminating in \u201cthree decades of raging schizophrenia\u201d in hospitals and asylums. That timeline confirms adult development.  \n2. Distinct phases\u2014genius, madness, remission  \n   \u2013 Nash\u2019s life divides cleanly into a pre-illness phase of prodigious mathematical work at Princeton and RAND, a middle phase of florid psychosis (stints in asylums, public disrobing, delusions of alien messages), and a late phase of recovery culminating in Nobel recognition. Such a triphasic progression is characteristic of adult-onset schizophrenia followed by remission.  \n3. Evidence of genuine improvement  \n   \u2013 The \u201cvery fine person\u201d he became after the Nobel, living humbly with his son and managing daily life, illustrates true recovery (<quote> Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--</quote>)\u2014not merely masking congenital craziness.  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Main Points  \n1. Childhood cruelty \u2260 psychosis  \n   \u2013 Debater_A misreads violent or antisocial conduct as evidence of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is defined by hallucinations, delusions, disordered thought\u2014not by cruelty or risk-taking.  \n2. No proof of lifelong madness  \n   \u2013 If Nash had been \u201cborn crazy,\u201d the text would have noted early psychiatric symptoms; instead it emphasizes academic brilliance through his twenties without hint of mental illness.  \n3. Improvement invalidates congenital theory  \n   \u2013 Congenital mental illness, especially schizophrenia, rarely yields spontaneous remission after decades. Nash\u2019s unusual improvement in the 1990s, confirmed by multiple sources in the text, argues strongly for an illness that arose later and then partially resolved\u2014not a lifelong condition.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe text unambiguously locates Nash\u2019s psychosis onset in adulthood\u2014around age thirty\u2014and details a significant remission decades later. There is no textual support for the notion that he was \u201cborn crazy.\u201d Thus, the correct interpretation is that John Nash developed mental illness as an adult but later improved.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI will show that the text portrays Nash not as a man who only \u201cdeveloped\u201d madness in adulthood, but as someone whose odd, even cruel, behavior\u2014and underlying mental instability\u2014was evident from childhood, long before his 30s breakdown. At the same time, it chronicles his extraordinary mathematical achievements.  \n\n1. Early signs of pathology long before age thirty  \n   \u2022 Childhood cruelty: \u201cAs a boy \u2026 Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 That is not normal adolescent mischief\u2014it signals deep-seated pathology.  \n   \u2022 Teenage risk taking: Experimenting with explosives that killed a friend shows reckless, antisocial impulses rooted in his youth.  \n\n2. Pervasive eccentricity predating his \u201cbreakdown\u201d  \n   \u2022 Strange obsessions: Long before his formal diagnosis, Nash \u201cshowed an intense interest in the state of Israel\u2014often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew.\u201d (background)  \n   \u2022 Public disrobing: \u201cGeniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public \u2026 Nash showed up for an MIT New Year\u2019s Eve party clad only in a diaper.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 These bizarre acts did not suddenly begin at age 30\u2014they were part of his pattern in early adulthood.  \n\n3. Mathematical genius coexisting with lifelong mental instability  \n   \u2022 Early Princeton triumph: \u201cWithin two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games.\u201d (background)  \n   \u2022 Profound contributions amid personal chaos: While displaying odd and cruel behavior even as a teacher\u2014humiliating students, marital violence\u2014he still \u201cdisposed of a deep problem \u2026 any Riemannian manifold \u2026 can be embedded in Euclidean space.\u201d (background)  \n\n4. Flaw in Debater_B\u2019s thesis  \n   Debater_B claims Nash \u201cdeveloped mental illness as an adult but later improved,\u201d implying a clean slate until 30. That directly contradicts the text\u2019s numerous pre-30 incidents:  \n   \u2022 Animal torture and bomb-making are not adult-onset psychosis but early antisocial and possibly schizoid traits.  \n   \u2022 Public indecency and delusional obsessions about Israel occurred in his twenties, before his famous \u201cbreakdown.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nThe background clearly depicts Nash as someone with deep-rooted, lifelong mental disturbance\u2014present from boyhood\u2014who nonetheless accomplished landmark work in mathematics and economics. Therefore, the correct interpretation is \u201cHe was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He developed mental illness as an adult but later improved\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Mathematical genius coexisting with lifelong mental instability  \n   \u2022 Early Princeton triumph: \u201cWithin two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games.\u201d (background)  \n   \u2022 Profound contributions amid personal chaos: While displaying odd and cruel behavior even as a teacher\u2014humiliating students, marital violence\u2014he still \u201cdisposed of a deep problem \u2026 any Riemannian manifold \u2026 can be embedded in Euclidean space.\u201d (background)  \n\n4. Flaw in Debater_B\u2019s thesis  \n   Debater_B claims Nash \u201cdeveloped mental illness as an adult but later improved,\u201d implying a clean slate until 30. That directly contradicts the text\u2019s numerous pre-30 incidents:  \n   \u2022 Animal torture and bomb-making are not adult-onset psychosis but early antisocial and possibly schizoid traits.  \n   \u2022 Public indecency and delusional obsessions about Israel occurred in his twenties, before his famous \u201cbreakdown.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nThe background clearly depicts Nash as someone with deep-rooted, lifelong mental disturbance\u2014present from boyhood\u2014who nonetheless accomplished landmark work in mathematics and economics. Therefore, the correct interpretation is \u201cHe was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBorn Crazy\u201d Thesis  \n1. No childhood psychosis described  \n   \u2013 The background text paints Nash\u2019s childhood as troubled\u2014animal torture, homemade bombs\u2014but never mentions hallucinations, delusions, or other clinical signs of schizophrenia before age thirty. Debater_A\u2019s claim of innate craziness relies on conflating antisocial or violent behavior with psychosis, but these are distinct.  \n2. Onset at thirty is explicit  \n   \u2013 The text states that John Nash \u201cwent crazy at the age of 30\u201d (<quote> Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 a</quote>). That pinpoints adult onset, not congenital madness.  \n3. Improvement after decades of illness  \n   \u2013 Nash\u2019s case is notable for a late-life remission: \u201cin the \u201990s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d (<quote>Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down.</quote>). A person born crazy could not so clearly \u201cimprove\u201d decades later; improvement after adult-onset schizophrenia underscores that the illness arose in adulthood.  \n\nII. Positive Case for \u201cDeveloped Mental Illness as an Adult but Later Improved\u201d  \n1. Adult-onset schizophrenia is well documented  \n   \u2013 The text chronicles Nash\u2019s dramatic breakdown in 1959, at roughly age thirty, culminating in \u201cthree decades of raging schizophrenia\u201d in hospitals and asylums. That timeline confirms adult development.  \n2. Distinct phases\u2014genius, madness, remission  \n   \u2013 Nash\u2019s life divides cleanly into a pre-illness phase of prodigious mathematical work at Princeton and RAND, a middle phase of florid psychosis (stints in asylums, public disrobing, delusions of alien messages), and a late phase of recovery culminating in Nobel recognition. Such a triphasic progression is characteristic of adult-onset schizophrenia followed by remission.  \n3. Evidence of genuine improvement  \n   \u2013 The \u201cvery fine person\u201d he became after the Nobel, living humbly with his son and managing daily life, illustrates true recovery (<quote> Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--</quote>)\u2014not merely masking congenital craziness.  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Main Points  \n1. Childhood cruelty \u2260 psychosis  \n   \u2013 Debater_A misreads violent or antisocial conduct as evidence of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is defined by hallucinations, delusions, disordered thought\u2014not by cruelty or risk-taking.  \n2. No proof of lifelong madness  \n   \u2013 If Nash had been \u201cborn crazy,\u201d the text would have noted early psychiatric symptoms; instead it emphasizes academic brilliance through his twenties without hint of mental illness.  \n3. Improvement invalidates congenital theory  \n   \u2013 Congenital mental illness, especially schizophrenia, rarely yields spontaneous remission after decades. Nash\u2019s unusual improvement in the 1990s, confirmed by multiple sources in the text, argues strongly for an illness that arose later and then partially resolved\u2014not a lifelong condition.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe text unambiguously locates Nash\u2019s psychosis onset in adulthood\u2014around age thirty\u2014and details a significant remission decades later. There is no textual support for the notion that he was \u201cborn crazy.\u201d Thus, the correct interpretation is that John Nash developed mental illness as an adult but later improved.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s Key Claims  \n1. \u201cWent crazy at age 30\u201d is a milestone, not true onset  \n   \u2022 The phrase <quote> went crazy at the age of 30 </quote> marks the first full-blown psychotic breakdown, but it does not imply that Nash\u2019s mental instability began only then. Clinical schizophrenia often follows years of sub-threshold symptoms\u2014precisely what we see in Nash\u2019s youth.  \n2. Childhood cruelty and risk-taking are not mere delinquency  \n   \u2022 Debater_B insists that animal torture and bomb-making aren\u2019t psychiatric. Yet the text says Nash \u201cenjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed.\u201d Such sadistic behavior in childhood is a well-documented prodrome of severe personality disturbance and psychosis, not simply youthful mischief.  \n3. Later \u201cimprovement\u201d is remission, not evidence of adult onset  \n   \u2022 Schizophrenia may wax and wane over decades. The fact that \u201cthe voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d in the \u201990s (<quote>Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down.</quote>) shows remission, not a newfound sanity after a purely adult-onset illness.  \n\nII. Positive Case for Lifelong Madness Coexisting with Genius  \n1. Early-life pleiotropy of \u201cmadness\u201d and mathematical talent  \n   \u2022 The book opens by comparing nearsightedness and high IQ\u2014an accidental genetic link called pleiotropy. By analogy, \u201cthe same genes that tend to elevate IQ\u201d likely predisposed Nash to mental instability <quote> Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? </quote>. This suggests an inborn vulnerability to psychosis that accompanied his genius from the start.  \n2. Subclinical symptoms throughout youth and early adulthood  \n   \u2022 Obsessive, delusional-tinged interests: long before age 30, Nash \u201cshowed an intense interest in the state of Israel\u2014often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Public bizarre behavior predating the breakdown: he \u201cshowed up for an MIT New Year\u2019s Eve party clad only in a diaper,\u201d a classic hallucination-powered exhibitionism rather than mere prank.  \n3. Monumental achievements amid ongoing instability  \n   \u2022 Princeton breakthrough: Within two years of arriving at Princeton Nash \u201cframed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games,\u201d even as his peculiarities mounted.  \n   \u2022 Riemannian manifold result: He \u201cdisposed of a deep problem \u2026 by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities,\u201d befuddling colleagues\u2014proof that his mental quirks and mathematical creativity were inseparable.  \n\nIII. Why Debater_B\u2019s \u201cAdult-Onset\u201d Framing Fails  \n1. Conflating a psychotic episode with disease origin  \n   \u2022 Pointing to the first hospitalization at 30 ignores a decade of \u201ceccentric\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d conduct that the text repeatedly flags as pathological.  \n2. Misreading remission as recovery from adult-only illness  \n   \u2022 Late-life quieting of voices is typical of schizophrenia\u2019s chronic-relapsing course; it does not imply he was \u201cnormal\u201d until age 30.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nAll evidence points to John Nash\u2019s mental instability as an ingrained trait\u2014evident in childhood cruelty, adolescent bomb-making, early delusional fixations, and bizarre public acts\u2014running in parallel with his mathematical genius. His landmark achievements did not await adulthood-only sanity, nor did his supposed \u201conset\u201d at 30 mark the birth of his madness. The correct interpretation is: \u201cHe was born crazy but accomplished a lot in life anyway.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A Conflates Antisocial Behavior with Schizophrenia  \n1. Childhood cruelty \u2260 psychosis  \n   \u2013 Nash\u2019s \u201ctorturing animals and building homemade bombs\u201d describes antisocial or violent behavior, not the core symptoms of schizophrenia (hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thought). The text never ascribes any clinical psychotic symptoms to his youth.  \n2. Eccentric interests aren\u2019t delusions  \n   \u2013 An \u201cintense interest in the state of Israel\u201d (<quote>as showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew.</quote>) may be odd, but it isn\u2019t a fixed, false belief held despite clear evidence to the contrary. The text explicitly ties his first \u201ccrazy\u201d episode\u2014and its onset of full-blown schizophrenia\u2014to age thirty.  \n\nII. Onset of Full-Blown Psychosis at Age Thirty  \n1. Textual timestamp  \n   \u2013 \u201cwent crazy at the age of 30\u201d (<quote>Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30</quote>). That is the narrator\u2019s clear marker of when clinical insanity set in.  \n2. Pre-30 achievements without psychosis  \n   \u2013 Up through his Princeton breakthrough and his work at RAND, Nash exhibits brilliance and only socially atypical behavior\u2014not psychotic episodes. If he\u2019d been \u201ccrazy\u201d from birth, the text would have signaled early hallucinations or delusions, but it does not.  \n\nIII. Evidence of Significant Remission  \n1. Late-life improvement defies congenital theory  \n   \u2013 \u201cThen, in the \u201990s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down\u201d (<quote>Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down.</quote>)\u2014a genuine remission after decades of schizophrenia, which is extraordinarily rare.  \n2. Transformation into a \u201cvery fine person\u201d  \n   \u2013 Post-Nobel, Nash \u201cevolved into a \u2018very fine person,\u2019\u201d resuming stable family life and modest living (<quote>Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife</quote>). Such recovery from an adult-onset psychosis is incompatible with lifelong congenital madness.  \n\nIV. Why Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBorn Crazy\u201d Thesis Fails  \n1. No textual support for childhood psychosis  \n   \u2013 All early anecdotes\u2014animal cruelty, bomb-making\u2014are behavioral or moral deviations, not psychiatric symptoms.  \n2. Premature labeling of eccentricity as insanity  \n   \u2013 Public disrobing at an MIT party is presented as part of his breakdown phase, but even Debater_A cites it without proof it preceded age thirty. The text groups these acts with his later \u201craging schizophrenia.\u201d  \n3. Lifespan tripartition confirms adult-onset model  \n   \u2013 The narrative clearly divides into three phases: early genius (no clinical madness), middle madness (age 30\u201360), late remission (1990s onward). There is no fourth phase \u201ccongenital madness.\u201d  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe background explicitly dates Nash\u2019s psychotic break to age thirty, records three decades of schizophrenia, then describes a remarkable remission. There is no indication of clinical psychosis in childhood\u2014only destructive or eccentric behavior, which is not schizophrenia. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that he developed mental illness as an adult but later improved.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
