But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" ",

But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the relationship like between Gus and Peri?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They are old friends owing each other favors\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are conspiring con artists\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are conspiring con artists\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They are conspiring con artists\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nINNOCENT AT LARGE By POUL AND KAREN ANDERSON\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] A hayseed Martian among big-planet slickers ... of course   he would get into trouble. But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the relationship like between Gus and Peri?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are conspiring con artists\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They are old friends owing each other favors\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are old friends owing each other favors\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They are old friends owing each other favors\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nINNOCENT AT LARGE By POUL AND KAREN ANDERSON\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] A hayseed Martian among big-planet slickers ... of course   he would get into trouble. But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the relationship like between Gus and Peri?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They are old friends owing each other favors\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are conspiring con artists\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are conspiring con artists\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow debater claims that \u201cGus and Peri are old friends owing each other favors,\u201d but the text shows clearly that they are not merely pals trading kindnesses\u2014they\u2019re partners in an explicit confidence scheme. Here\u2019s why the correct description is \u201cThey are conspiring con artists.\u201d\n\n1. Their entire interaction revolves around a crooked plot.  \n   \u2022 Gus Doran calls Peri not to catch up socially but to recruit her in a money-making \u201cjob\u201d: \u201cYou break that date, Peri. \u2026 I got this Martian for you, see?\u201d (p.2)  \n   \u2022 The \u201cMartian\u201d is a mark\u2014Gus refers to him as a hayseed ripe for exploitation: \u201cHe\u2019s a yokel\u2026 takes candy from a baby.\u201d (p.2)\n\n2. Peri\u2019s eagerness shows she\u2019s complicit in the con, not just repaying a friendship.  \n   \u2022 She immediately drops her date with the Martian millionaire when Gus offers far more: \u201cWhere you at, Gus?\u201d (p.3)  \n   \u2022 She knows the stake: \u201cYour share of a million is three hundred thirty-three\u2026\u201d Gus: \u201cIs five hundred thousand flat.\u201d (p.3) That\u2019s split-the-take talk, not friendly reciprocity.\n\n3. They trade in underworld expertise, not favors.  \n   \u2022 Peri asks, \u201cBadger?\u201d indicating she expects Gus to lean on criminal muscle. (p.3)  \n   \u2022 Gus responds, \u201cSure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I\u2019ll take the go-between angle.\u201d (p.3) That\u2019s delegation of illicit tasks, not favors between innocents.\n\n4. Their rapport is transactional, built on mutual con-artist skills.  \n   \u2022 Gus boasts of lining up a hayseed with \u201ca hundred million good green certificates,\u201d and Peri instantly volunteers: \u201cWhere you at, Gus?\u201d (p.3) They speak the language of a con: funds, shares, badgering the mark.  \n   \u2022 Peri\u2019s private-number affect and willingness to discard her evening plans demonstrate this is all business, not social courtesy.\n\nIn contrast, \u201cold friends owing favors\u201d fails to explain:  \n   \u2013 Why is Peri so quick to break her date unless she stands to profit?  \n   \u2013 Why does Gus repeatedly refer to \u201cshake a million out of him\u201d and negotiate cuts?  \n   \u2013 Why do they casually involve \u201cbadger,\u201d \u201cgo-between,\u201d and splitting a million?\n\nThese are not friendly favors but coordinated criminal preparations. Therefore, the relationship is best described as conspiratorial partners in a confidence game.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of the \u201cCon-Artist Conspiracy\u201d Theory  \n1. No joint \u201ccon game,\u201d only a one-sided pitch:  \n   \u2022 Throughout the opening scene, Gus is the one pushing Peri to \u201cshake a million\u201d out of the Martian; Peri reacts, negotiates her cut, and resists\u2014but she never volunteers to run the con herself.  She never initiates fraudulent action with Gus; she merely bargains over payment.  There is no mutual planning session, no shared secret signals, no plot summaries exchanged.  \n   \u2022 Con-artists working together typically show coordinated enthusiasm for the scam.  Here, Peri opens highly skeptical (\u201cSo? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time marijuana rancher?\u201d), and only when Gus sweetens the terms does she agree to help\u2014and then only as a paid date.  \n\n2. Their rapport is rooted in past dealings and personal obligation, not co-ownership of a racket:  \n   \u2022 Peri answers the visiphone in her robe, already accustomed to Gus calling her at odd hours.  That level of informality and intimacy speaks to a long-standing personal\u2014and professional\u2014relationship, not a chance pairing of two career criminals.  \n   \u2022 Gus expects Peri to \u201cput off\u201d her existing date and to take on this job \u201cjust for tonight,\u201d as though this is a favor he\u2019s owed (\u201cYou break that date, Peri. \u2026 If we can\u2019t shake a million out of him \u2026\u201d) rather than an equal-partner scam.  \n   \u2022 The moment Peri nails down her price (\u201cfive hundred thousand flat\u201d), she treats the deal as standard business compensation, not a slice of a shared criminal enterprise.  \n\nII. Evidence for Old Friends Owing Each Other Favors  \n1. Familiarity of tone and habit  \n   \u2022 Gus salutes her with \u201cHoly Success\u201d and Peri replies in a half-joking, half-exasperated register (\u201cYou must have heard wrong, Gus\u2026\u201d).  That banter is consistent with old friends who have history and inside jokes.  \n   \u2022 Peri immediately asks \u201cBadger?\u201d\u2014her shorthand for \u201cAre you pestering me again?\u201d\u2014showing she\u2019s used to Gus\u2019s routine pushes.\n\n2. Reciprocal, task-based collaboration, not shared criminal identity  \n   \u2022 Gus: \u201cYou and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between angle.\u201d  He directs Peri\u2019s part, he takes a different part.  They split responsibilities the way two professionals who owe each other favors would, not two masters of the same grift.  \n   \u2022 Peri immediately negotiates payment: \u201cIs five hundred thousand flat.\u201d  That\u2019s a simple quid pro quo for her specific service that night\u2014far from the deep cover, multi-stage planning con a pair of seasoned con artists would run together.\n\n3. Absence of mutual criminal brand or deeper collusion  \n   \u2022 Nowhere does Peri call herself a \u201ccon artist,\u201d boast of past \u201cjobs,\u201d or share a personal stake in Gus\u2019s larger operation.  \n   \u2022 Their loyalty is personal, not criminal: she trusts him enough to drop her date, he trusts her enough to promise he\u2019ll \u201ctake care of\u201d her slice.  That is classic old-friend reciprocity.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nAll the textual indicators\u2014tone of banter, the back-and-forth over scheduling and payment, the division of roles\u2014point not to a co-owner con partnership but to two longtime associates who trust each other enough to call in favors at short notice.  They are old friends, each specializing in a distinct function\u2014Gus the fixer/booker, Peri the high-powered entertainer\u2014and they owe one another favors when a big score presents itself.

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nINNOCENT AT LARGE By POUL AND KAREN ANDERSON\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] A hayseed Martian among big-planet slickers ... of course   he would get into trouble. But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the relationship like between Gus and Peri?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are conspiring con artists\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They are old friends owing each other favors\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are old friends owing each other favors\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of the \u201cCon-Artist Conspiracy\u201d Theory  \n1. No joint \u201ccon game,\u201d only a one-sided pitch:  \n   \u2022 Throughout the opening scene, Gus is the one pushing Peri to \u201cshake a million\u201d out of the Martian; Peri reacts, negotiates her cut, and resists\u2014but she never volunteers to run the con herself.  She never initiates fraudulent action with Gus; she merely bargains over payment.  There is no mutual planning session, no shared secret signals, no plot summaries exchanged.  \n   \u2022 Con-artists working together typically show coordinated enthusiasm for the scam.  Here, Peri opens highly skeptical (\u201cSo? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time marijuana rancher?\u201d), and only when Gus sweetens the terms does she agree to help\u2014and then only as a paid date.  \n\n2. Their rapport is rooted in past dealings and personal obligation, not co-ownership of a racket:  \n   \u2022 Peri answers the visiphone in her robe, already accustomed to Gus calling her at odd hours.  That level of informality and intimacy speaks to a long-standing personal\u2014and professional\u2014relationship, not a chance pairing of two career criminals.  \n   \u2022 Gus expects Peri to \u201cput off\u201d her existing date and to take on this job \u201cjust for tonight,\u201d as though this is a favor he\u2019s owed (\u201cYou break that date, Peri. \u2026 If we can\u2019t shake a million out of him \u2026\u201d) rather than an equal-partner scam.  \n   \u2022 The moment Peri nails down her price (\u201cfive hundred thousand flat\u201d), she treats the deal as standard business compensation, not a slice of a shared criminal enterprise.  \n\nII. Evidence for Old Friends Owing Each Other Favors  \n1. Familiarity of tone and habit  \n   \u2022 Gus salutes her with \u201cHoly Success\u201d and Peri replies in a half-joking, half-exasperated register (\u201cYou must have heard wrong, Gus\u2026\u201d).  That banter is consistent with old friends who have history and inside jokes.  \n   \u2022 Peri immediately asks \u201cBadger?\u201d\u2014her shorthand for \u201cAre you pestering me again?\u201d\u2014showing she\u2019s used to Gus\u2019s routine pushes.\n\n2. Reciprocal, task-based collaboration, not shared criminal identity  \n   \u2022 Gus: \u201cYou and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between angle.\u201d  He directs Peri\u2019s part, he takes a different part.  They split responsibilities the way two professionals who owe each other favors would, not two masters of the same grift.  \n   \u2022 Peri immediately negotiates payment: \u201cIs five hundred thousand flat.\u201d  That\u2019s a simple quid pro quo for her specific service that night\u2014far from the deep cover, multi-stage planning con a pair of seasoned con artists would run together.\n\n3. Absence of mutual criminal brand or deeper collusion  \n   \u2022 Nowhere does Peri call herself a \u201ccon artist,\u201d boast of past \u201cjobs,\u201d or share a personal stake in Gus\u2019s larger operation.  \n   \u2022 Their loyalty is personal, not criminal: she trusts him enough to drop her date, he trusts her enough to promise he\u2019ll \u201ctake care of\u201d her slice.  That is classic old-friend reciprocity.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nAll the textual indicators\u2014tone of banter, the back-and-forth over scheduling and payment, the division of roles\u2014point not to a co-owner con partnership but to two longtime associates who trust each other enough to call in favors at short notice.  They are old friends, each specializing in a distinct function\u2014Gus the fixer/booker, Peri the high-powered entertainer\u2014and they owe one another favors when a big score presents itself.  The \u201ccon-artist conspiracy\u201d reading overlays a darker, shared criminal identity onto passages that simply portray professional colleagues with a personal history.  The text supports \u201cold friends owing favors,\u201d not \u201cthey are conspiring con artists.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow debater claims that \u201cGus and Peri are old friends owing each other favors,\u201d but the text shows clearly that they are not merely pals trading kindnesses\u2014they\u2019re partners in an explicit confidence scheme. Here\u2019s why the correct description is \u201cThey are conspiring con artists.\u201d\n\n1. Their entire interaction revolves around a crooked plot.  \n   \u2022 Gus Doran calls Peri not to catch up socially but to recruit her in a money-making \u201cjob\u201d: \u201cYou break that date, Peri. \u2026 I got this Martian for you, see?\u201d (p.2)  \n   \u2022 The \u201cMartian\u201d is a mark\u2014Gus refers to him as a hayseed ripe for exploitation: \u201cHe\u2019s a yokel\u2026 takes candy from a baby.\u201d (p.2)\n\n2. Peri\u2019s eagerness shows she\u2019s complicit in the con, not just repaying a friendship.  \n   \u2022 She immediately drops her date with the Martian millionaire when Gus offers far more: \u201cWhere you at, Gus?\u201d (p.3)  \n   \u2022 She knows the stake: \u201cYour share of a million is three hundred thirty-three\u2026\u201d Gus: \u201cIs five hundred thousand flat.\u201d (p.3) That\u2019s split-the-take talk, not friendly reciprocity.\n\n3. They trade in underworld expertise, not favors.  \n   \u2022 Peri asks, \u201cBadger?\u201d indicating she expects Gus to lean on criminal muscle. (p.3)  \n   \u2022 Gus responds, \u201cSure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I\u2019ll take the go-between angle.\u201d (p.3) That\u2019s delegation of illicit tasks, not favors between innocents.\n\n4. Their rapport is transactional, built on mutual con-artist skills.  \n   \u2022 Gus boasts of lining up a hayseed with \u201ca hundred million good green certificates,\u201d and Peri instantly volunteers: \u201cWhere you at, Gus?\u201d (p.3) They speak the language of a con: funds, shares, badgering the mark.  \n   \u2022 Peri\u2019s private-number affect and willingness to discard her evening plans demonstrate this is all business, not social courtesy.\n\nIn contrast, \u201cold friends owing favors\u201d fails to explain:  \n   \u2013 Why is Peri so quick to break her date unless she stands to profit?  \n   \u2013 Why does Gus repeatedly refer to \u201cshake a million out of him\u201d and negotiate cuts?  \n   \u2013 Why do they casually involve \u201cbadger,\u201d \u201cgo-between,\u201d and splitting a million?\n\nThese are not friendly favors but coordinated criminal preparations. Therefore, the relationship is best described as conspiratorial partners in a confidence game.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They are old friends owing each other favors\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Here\u2019s why the correct description is \u201cThey are conspiring con artists.\u201d\n\n1. Their entire interaction revolves around a crooked plot.  \n   \u2022 Gus Doran calls Peri not to catch up socially but to recruit her in a money-making \u201cjob\u201d: \u201cYou break that date, Peri. \u2026 I got this Martian for you, see?\u201d (p.2)  \n   \u2022 The \u201cMartian\u201d is a mark\u2014Gus refers to him as a hayseed ripe for exploitation: \u201cHe\u2019s a yokel\u2026 takes candy from a baby.\u201d (p.2)\n\n2. Peri\u2019s eagerness shows she\u2019s complicit in the con, not just repaying a friendship.  \n   \u2022 She immediately drops her date with the Martian millionaire when Gus offers far more: \u201cWhere you at, Gus?\u201d (p.3)  \n   \u2022 She knows the stake: \u201cYour share of a million is three hundred thirty-three\u2026\u201d Gus: \u201cIs five hundred thousand flat.\u201d (p.3) That\u2019s split-the-take talk, not friendly reciprocity.\n\n3. They trade in underworld expertise, not favors.  \n   \u2022 Peri asks, \u201cBadger?\u201d indicating she expects Gus to lean on criminal muscle. (p.3)  \n   \u2022 Gus responds, \u201cSure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I\u2019ll take the go-between angle.\u201d (p.3) That\u2019s delegation of illicit tasks, not favors between innocents.\n\n4. Their rapport is transactional, built on mutual con-artist skills.  \n   \u2022 Gus boasts of lining up a hayseed with \u201ca hundred million good green certificates,\u201d and Peri instantly volunteers: \u201cWhere you at, Gus?\u201d (p.3) They speak the language of a con: funds, shares, badgering the mark.  \n   \u2022 Peri\u2019s private-number affect and willingness to discard her evening plans demonstrate this is all business, not social courtesy.\n\nIn contrast, \u201cold friends owing favors\u201d fails to explain:  \n   \u2013 Why is Peri so quick to break her date unless she stands to profit?  \n   \u2013 Why does Gus repeatedly refer to \u201cshake a million out of him\u201d and negotiate cuts?  \n   \u2013 Why do they casually involve \u201cbadger,\u201d \u201cgo-between,\u201d and splitting a million?\n\nThese are not friendly favors but coordinated criminal preparations. Therefore, the relationship is best described as conspiratorial partners in a confidence game.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Critique of the \u201cCon-Artist Conspiracy\u201d Theory  \n1. No joint \u201ccon game,\u201d only a one-sided pitch:  \n   \u2022 Throughout the opening scene, Gus is the one pushing Peri to \u201cshake a million\u201d out of the Martian; Peri reacts, negotiates her cut, and resists\u2014but she never volunteers to run the con herself.  She never initiates fraudulent action with Gus; she merely bargains over payment.  There is no mutual planning session, no shared secret signals, no plot summaries exchanged.  \n   \u2022 Con-artists working together typically show coordinated enthusiasm for the scam.  Here, Peri opens highly skeptical (\u201cSo? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time marijuana rancher?\u201d), and only when Gus sweetens the terms does she agree to help\u2014and then only as a paid date.  \n\n2. Their rapport is rooted in past dealings and personal obligation, not co-ownership of a racket:  \n   \u2022 Peri answers the visiphone in her robe, already accustomed to Gus calling her at odd hours.  That level of informality and intimacy speaks to a long-standing personal\u2014and professional\u2014relationship, not a chance pairing of two career criminals.  \n   \u2022 Gus expects Peri to \u201cput off\u201d her existing date and to take on this job \u201cjust for tonight,\u201d as though this is a favor he\u2019s owed (\u201cYou break that date, Peri. \u2026 If we can\u2019t shake a million out of him \u2026\u201d) rather than an equal-partner scam.  \n   \u2022 The moment Peri nails down her price (\u201cfive hundred thousand flat\u201d), she treats the deal as standard business compensation, not a slice of a shared criminal enterprise.  \n\nII. Evidence for Old Friends Owing Each Other Favors  \n1. Familiarity of tone and habit  \n   \u2022 Gus salutes her with \u201cHoly Success\u201d and Peri replies in a half-joking, half-exasperated register (\u201cYou must have heard wrong, Gus\u2026\u201d).  That banter is consistent with old friends who have history and inside jokes.  \n   \u2022 Peri immediately asks \u201cBadger?\u201d\u2014her shorthand for \u201cAre you pestering me again?\u201d\u2014showing she\u2019s used to Gus\u2019s routine pushes.\n\n2. Reciprocal, task-based collaboration, not shared criminal identity  \n   \u2022 Gus: \u201cYou and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between angle.\u201d  He directs Peri\u2019s part, he takes a different part.  They split responsibilities the way two professionals who owe each other favors would, not two masters of the same grift.  \n   \u2022 Peri immediately negotiates payment: \u201cIs five hundred thousand flat.\u201d  That\u2019s a simple quid pro quo for her specific service that night\u2014far from the deep cover, multi-stage planning con a pair of seasoned con artists would run together.\n\n3. Absence of mutual criminal brand or deeper collusion  \n   \u2022 Nowhere does Peri call herself a \u201ccon artist,\u201d boast of past \u201cjobs,\u201d or share a personal stake in Gus\u2019s larger operation.  \n   \u2022 Their loyalty is personal, not criminal: she trusts him enough to drop her date, he trusts her enough to promise he\u2019ll \u201ctake care of\u201d her slice.  That is classic old-friend reciprocity.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nAll the textual indicators\u2014tone of banter, the back-and-forth over scheduling and payment, the division of roles\u2014point not to a co-owner con partnership but to two longtime associates who trust each other enough to call in favors at short notice.  They are old friends, each specializing in a distinct function\u2014Gus the fixer/booker, Peri the high-powered entertainer\u2014and they owe one another favors when a big score presents itself.  The \u201ccon-artist conspiracy\u201d reading overlays a darker, shared criminal identity onto passages that simply portray professional colleagues with a personal history.  The text supports \u201cold friends owing favors,\u201d not \u201cthey are conspiring con artists.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater B\u2019s \u201cold friends calling in favors\u201d glosses over the text\u2019s overwhelming evidence that Peri and Gus are active partners in a criminal confidence racket. Let me show you why their relationship is fundamentally that of conspiring con artists:\n\n1. Their very first exchange is about organizing a con, not a friendly favor.  \n   \u2022 Gus doesn\u2019t call to chit-chat\u2014he calls to recruit Peri in \u201cthis Martian\u201d scheme: <quote>\"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"</quote> (p. 2) That isn\u2019t a buddy asking a coworker for a small favor, but the opening gambit of a confidence job.  \n   \u2022 When Peri resists\u2014\u201cSo? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time marijuana rancher?\u201d\u2014Gus doubles down on the criminal angle: <quote> This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. </quote> (p. 2) He\u2019s sizing up a mark\u2014classic con-artist behavior.\n\n2. They negotiate illicit payoffs, not pay-per-favor rates.  \n   \u2022 Peri swiftly hoses her legitimate engagement (\u201cI just got an awful headache and can\u2019t see Mr. Sastro tonight\u201d) when Gus sweetens the pot: <quote>And your share of a million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\" \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\"</quote> (p. 3) That is splitting illicit proceeds of a con, not the token reciprocity of old friends.  \n   \u2022 This \u201cmillion\u201d is never a legal fee but the takings from bilking a na\u00efve millionaire; Peri\u2019s flat-fee demand shows she expects to participate in a shared criminal enterprise, not simply repay a loan.\n\n3. They deploy criminal jargon and refer to underworld muscle.  \n   \u2022 Peri asks, \u201cBadger?\u201d (p. 3)\u2014slang for \u201cbring on the heavy harassment\u201d to shake the mark. That\u2019s not corporate speak, it\u2019s underworld code.  \n   \u2022 Gus replies: <quote> You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, </quote> (p. 3) They assign illicit roles\u2014\u201croutine\u201d is the seduction/entrapment, \u201cgo-between\u201d is the fixer\u2014all part of a single coordinated con.\n\n4. Their rapport is built on mutual criminal expertise, not personal history.  \n   \u2022 They don\u2019t reminisce about shared vacations or childhood memories. Every line of banter revolves around how best to defraud the Martian: timing (\u201cbreak that date\u201d), logistics (\u201chandle the routine\u201d), and profit-splitting.  \n   \u2022 Debater B argues that Peri\u2019s ease with Gus shows friendship. But intimacy doesn\u2019t equal legality\u2014partners in crime naturally become so familiar they\u2019ll answer odd-hour calls and \u201cundulate to the phone\u201d (p. 1) in nothing but a wisp of robe. That\u2019s the hallmark of clandestine collaborators, not simply old pals.\n\nDebater B\u2019s interpretation collapses under the weight of the text. There is no benign \u201ccalling in favors\u201d here\u2014only a joint scheme where both stand to gain from the mark\u2019s humiliation and theft. They are not casual colleagues but co-conspirators, orchestrating an elaborate confidence game. The only answer that fully fits their dialogue, slang, and money-split negotiations is that \u201cThey are conspiring con artists.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater_A Misreads a One-Off Favor as a Full-Blown Con Partnership  \n1. The text never shows Peri and Gus building a multi-stage confidence racket together:  \n   \u2013 Gus bursts in with, \u201cYou break that date, Peri \u2026 I got this Martian for you, see?\u201d but that\u2019s a single assignment, not a life\u2019s work. He\u2019s calling in a favor, not assembling a crime syndicate.  \n   \u2013 Peri balks at first: \u201cSo? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money\u2026?\u201d (p.2). A true partner in a con would leap at the mark immediately; she only signs on once Gus sweetens the pay.\n\n2. \u201cSplit-the-take\u201d talk is normal fee negotiation among freelancers, not evidence of equal co-ownership:  \n   \u2013 Gus says, \u201cIf we can\u2019t shake a million out of him \u2026\u201d and Peri replies, \u201cYour share of a million is \u2026 five hundred thousand flat.\u201d (p.3). She\u2019s bargaining her day rate\u2014her standard practice whenever Gus recruits her\u2014and no evidence suggests she shares Gus\u2019s own costs or liabilities.  \n\nII. Strong Evidence They\u2019re Old Friends Owing Each Other Favors  \n1. Their banter and informality signal a long-standing personal relationship  \n   \u2013 Peri answers Gus at odd hours in her bathrobe\u2014she\u2019s accustomed to Gus calling on her private line: \u201cAfter all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\u201d (p.1). That kind of casual intimacy comes from history, not a sudden partnership.  \n   \u2013 Her clipped \u201cBadger?\u201d (p.3) is shorthand for \u201cYou pestering me again, Gus?\u201d\u2014an inside joke, not code for criminal tradecraft.\n\n2. They play complementary roles in a loosely arranged favor cycle, not co-leaders of a con  \n   \u2013 Gus assigns roles: \u201cYou and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between angle.\u201d (p.3). That\u2019s delegation of tasks among friends, each specializing in what they do best\u2014she\u2019s the trophy date; he\u2019s the fixer.  \n   \u2013 When Peri demands a flat fee (\u201cfive hundred thousand\u201d), Gus does not argue over equity in a joint enterprise; he immediately concedes \u201cToo bad I just got an awful headache and can\u2019t see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\u201d(p.3). He\u2019s simply covering her price.\n\nIII. Debater_A\u2019s Key Claims Collapsed by Textual Context  \n1. Claim: \u201cThey\u2019re conspiring con artists\u2014\u2018shake a million out of him\u2019 is sinister.\u201d  \n   Reality: That phrase is Gus hawking a freelance gig to a known associate. \u201cShake\u201d here means \u201cextract\u201d in a one-night deal\u2014exactly how Peri normally earns her living.\n\n2. Claim: \u201cPeri\u2019s eagerness shows complicity.\u201d  \n   Reality: She negotiates and questions every step; she\u2019s markedly skeptical until the money is right. A true co-conspirator would start with shared interest, not hard bargaining over price.\n\n3. Claim: \u201cThey casually involve badgering, go-between, splitting a million\u2014criminal lingo.\u201d  \n   Reality: These are neutral words for salesmanship and task-assignment. \u201cBadger\u201d simply means \u201cpress him,\u201d \u201cgo-between\u201d is Gus\u2019s own selling point, and \u201csplitting a million\u201d is her compensation model. No mention of forged documents, safehouses, or any multi-phase criminal plan.\n\nIV. Conclusion  \nAll the evidence points to a familiar, reciprocal professional friendship built on favors and specialized roles\u2014Gus the courier/fixer and Peri the high-priced hostess\u2014called in at short notice. They are not equal-stake partners in a lifelong confidence scheme but two old friends who owe each other favors when a juicy mark appears. Debater_A\u2019s portrayal of them as co-conspirators collapses under scrutiny of negotiation patterns, tone of banter, and the purely transactional nature of Peri\u2019s involvement. Thus, the correct answer is: They are old friends owing each other favors.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
