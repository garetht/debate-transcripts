{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 217, "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n", "question": "What mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military?", "first_debater_answer": "equating police and military", "second_debater_answer": "oversimplification", "debate_identifier": "We Do Understand_What mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"oversimplification\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"equating police and military\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"equating police and military\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that Tannen\u2019s key error in discussing the military is that she collapses two fundamentally different roles\u2014police and soldiers\u2014together, as though the same rules of \u201csnuggle\u201d versus \u201cstruggle\u201d should apply equally to both. Debater_B\u2019s claim\u2014that her mistake is merely \u201coversimplification\u201d\u2014is too vague and does not identify the concrete flaw in her reasoning.\n\n1. Tannen treats police and soldiers interchangeably.  \n   \u2022 She criticizes both cops and soldiers for being \u201ctrained to overcome their resistance to kill\u201d by \u201cnot \u2026 think[ing] of their opponents as human beings\u201d (<quote> cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\"</quote>).  \n   \u2022 But in law enforcement or war, dehumanizing an adversary is often a grim necessity to protect innocent lives. Lumping these two professions under the same reproach ignores their very different missions and constraints.\n\n2. She fails to distinguish between just causes and mere interpersonal conflict.  \n   \u2022 Tannen draws parallels between intimacy\u2010preserving \u201csnuggle\u201d advice for families and the ideal of civility in politics\u2014but then applies the same prescription to foreign policy and crime fighting.  \n   \u2022 In World War II she praises soldiers\u2019 camaraderie (<quote> they trained, served, and went home together. </quote>) but faults them for focusing on social bonds rather than on the fact that \u201cthey were fighting Hitler.\u201d She never acknowledges that in war the moral imperative to defeat evil can override the injunction against \u201cantagonism.\u201d\n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201coversimplification\u201d label fails to specify:  \n   \u2022 Every argument in this domain simplifies to some extent. But the specific error in Tannen\u2019s military discussion is not merely brevity or generalization\u2014it is the inappropriate moral equivalence she draws between protector roles (police, military) and private, non\u2010adversarial relationships.  \n   \u2022 Calling this \u201coversimplification\u201d sweeps her real mistake\u2014that she misunderstands and misrepresents the essential functions of security professions\u2014under the rug.\n\n4. By equating police and military with dysfunctional couples, Tannen undermines necessary vigilance.  \n   \u2022 The review observes: \u201cSome things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting\u201d (<quote>Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny</quote>). Yet Tannen\u2019s blanket anti\u2010antagonism would strip law enforcement and armed forces of their ability to confront real threats.  \n   \u2022 That is a conceptual error far more damaging than mere oversimplification; it misconceives the very purpose of these institutions.\n\nIn sum, Tannen makes a categorical mistake by equating the moral standards of personal relationships with the hard realities that govern police and military actions. That fundamental conflation\u2014not a simple \u201coversimplification\u201d\u2014is the crucial error in her discussion of the military.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThank you. Debater_A claims Tannen\u2019s \u201cmistake\u201d is that she \u201cequates police and military.\u201d In fact, nothing in the review shows Tannen collapsing law enforcement into the armed forces. Instead, her error is a broad, unnuanced oversimplification\u2014treating fundamentally different forms of struggle as if they were the same.  \n\n1. Tannen conflates distinct social spheres rather than \u201cequat[ing] police and military.\u201d  \n  \u2022 The reviewer explains that her real failing is \u201cfailing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.\u201d She then grants that \u201cvigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants\u201d (emphasis added). That recognition contradicts any claim that she collapses police into military roles.  \n\n2. Her discussion of the military exemplifies her oversimplification.  \n  \u2022 On Vietnam versus World War II, she \u201cfocuses strictly on the soldiers\u2019 social experience\u201d (\u201c\u2018Vietnam \u2026 was a \u2018lonely war\u2019 of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\u2019 She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d). By highlighting only the social arrangement and ignoring the vastly different strategic stakes, she reduces complex historical reality to a superficial comparison.  \n  \u2022 She criticizes both cops and soldiers for training \u201cnot to think of their opponents as human beings,\u201d yet fails to acknowledge that this dehumanization is a grim necessity of warfare and law enforcement. Declaring it simply \u201cinhumane\u201d ignores the operational realities that distinguish one form of conflict from another.  \n\n3. She applies the same oversimplification elsewhere.  \n  \u2022 The review shows her conflating \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation \u2026 anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d into a single \u201cargument culture.\u201d  \n  \u2022 She condemns the adversarial trial as \u201cinhumane\u201d because its \u201cpurpose \u2026 is \u2026 to discredit the witness,\u201d disregarding that fact-finding and legal standards differ radically across systems.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cequates police and military\u201d thesis cannot be supported by the text.  \n  \u2022 There is no passage where Tannen literally or effectively claims police and soldiers are identical. On the contrary, the review quotes Tannen conceding that law enforcement \u201cmust deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Alleging she equates them misrepresents her argument; the real flaw is her flattening of distinctions within and between social institutions.  \n\nIn sum, Tannen\u2019s chief mistake when discussing the military is one of oversimplification: she zooms in on single aspects\u2014social arrangements or dehumanizing training\u2014while ignoring strategic, moral, and historical distinctions that make each form of struggle unique. This broad-brush treatment, not a mislabeling of institutions, is the error she commits.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"equating police and military\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Debater_A still hasn\u2019t shown any passage where Tannen literally \u201cequates police and military\u201d as though they were the same institution.

Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat mistake does Tannen make when discussing the military?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"equating police and military\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"oversimplification\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"oversimplification\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThank you. Debater_A claims Tannen\u2019s \u201cmistake\u201d is that she \u201cequates police and military.\u201d In fact, nothing in the review shows Tannen collapsing law enforcement into the armed forces. Instead, her error is a broad, unnuanced oversimplification\u2014treating fundamentally different forms of struggle as if they were the same.  \n\n1. Tannen conflates distinct social spheres rather than \u201cequat[ing] police and military.\u201d  \n  \u2022 The reviewer explains that her real failing is \u201cfailing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.\u201d She then grants that \u201cvigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants\u201d (emphasis added). That recognition contradicts any claim that she collapses police into military roles.  \n\n2. Her discussion of the military exemplifies her oversimplification.  \n  \u2022 On Vietnam versus World War II, she \u201cfocuses strictly on the soldiers\u2019 social experience\u201d (\u201c\u2018Vietnam \u2026 was a \u2018lonely war\u2019 of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\u2019 She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d). By highlighting only the social arrangement and ignoring the vastly different strategic stakes, she reduces complex historical reality to a superficial comparison.  \n  \u2022 She criticizes both cops and soldiers for training \u201cnot to think of their opponents as human beings,\u201d yet fails to acknowledge that this dehumanization is a grim necessity of warfare and law enforcement. Declaring it simply \u201cinhumane\u201d ignores the operational realities that distinguish one form of conflict from another.  \n\n3. She applies the same oversimplification elsewhere.  \n  \u2022 The review shows her conflating \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation \u2026 anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d into a single \u201cargument culture.\u201d  \n  \u2022 She condemns the adversarial trial as \u201cinhumane\u201d because its \u201cpurpose \u2026 is \u2026 to discredit the witness,\u201d disregarding that fact-finding and legal standards differ radically across systems.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cequates police and military\u201d thesis cannot be supported by the text.  \n  \u2022 There is no passage where Tannen literally or effectively claims police and soldiers are identical. On the contrary, the review quotes Tannen conceding that law enforcement \u201cmust deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Alleging she equates them misrepresents her argument; the real flaw is her flattening of distinctions within and between social institutions.  \n\nIn sum, Tannen\u2019s chief mistake when discussing the military is one of oversimplification: she zooms in on single aspects\u2014social arrangements or dehumanizing training\u2014while ignoring strategic, moral, and historical distinctions that make each form of struggle unique. This broad-brush treatment, not a mislabeling of institutions, is the error she commits.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that Tannen\u2019s key error in discussing the military is that she collapses two fundamentally different roles\u2014police and soldiers\u2014together, as though the same rules of \u201csnuggle\u201d versus \u201cstruggle\u201d should apply equally to both. Debater_B\u2019s claim\u2014that her mistake is merely \u201coversimplification\u201d\u2014is too vague and does not identify the concrete flaw in her reasoning.\n\n1. Tannen treats police and soldiers interchangeably.  \n   \u2022 She criticizes both cops and soldiers for being \u201ctrained to overcome their resistance to kill\u201d by \u201cnot \u2026 think[ing] of their opponents as human beings\u201d (<quote> cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\"</quote>).  \n   \u2022 But in law enforcement or war, dehumanizing an adversary is often a grim necessity to protect innocent lives. Lumping these two professions under the same reproach ignores their very different missions and constraints.\n\n2. She fails to distinguish between just causes and mere interpersonal conflict.  \n   \u2022 Tannen draws parallels between intimacy\u2010preserving \u201csnuggle\u201d advice for families and the ideal of civility in politics\u2014but then applies the same prescription to foreign policy and crime fighting.  \n   \u2022 In World War II she praises soldiers\u2019 camaraderie (<quote> they trained, served, and went home together. </quote>) but faults them for focusing on social bonds rather than on the fact that \u201cthey were fighting Hitler.\u201d She never acknowledges that in war the moral imperative to defeat evil can override the injunction against \u201cantagonism.\u201d\n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201coversimplification\u201d label fails to specify:  \n   \u2022 Every argument in this domain simplifies to some extent. But the specific error in Tannen\u2019s military discussion is not merely brevity or generalization\u2014it is the inappropriate moral equivalence she draws between protector roles (police, military) and private, non\u2010adversarial relationships.  \n   \u2022 Calling this \u201coversimplification\u201d sweeps her real mistake\u2014that she misunderstands and misrepresents the essential functions of security professions\u2014under the rug.\n\n4. By equating police and military with dysfunctional couples, Tannen undermines necessary vigilance.  \n   \u2022 The review observes: \u201cSome things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting\u201d (<quote>Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny</quote>). Yet Tannen\u2019s blanket anti\u2010antagonism would strip law enforcement and armed forces of their ability to confront real threats.  \n   \u2022 That is a conceptual error far more damaging than mere oversimplification; it misconceives the very purpose of these institutions.\n\nIn sum, Tannen makes a categorical mistake by equating the moral standards of personal relationships with the hard realities that govern police and military actions. That fundamental conflation\u2014not a simple \u201coversimplification\u201d\u2014is the crucial error in her discussion of the military.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"oversimplification\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Here\u2019s why Debater_B is wrong and why \u201cequating police and military\u201d is the correct diagnosis:\n\n1. Tannen groups cops and soldiers in one blanket critique.  \n   \u2022 She writes that \u201ccops and soldiers have been \u2018trained to overcome their resistance to kill\u2019 by trying \u2018not to think of their opponents as human beings.\u2019\u201d (<quote>cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\"</quote>)  \n   \u2022 By faulting both professions equally for dehumanization, she ignores that dehumanizing enemy combatants in war and de-escalation tactics in policing serve entirely different ethical and operational aims. This is not merely a lack of nuance\u2014she collapses two roles with distinct rules of engagement into one.\n\n2. The \u201csphere of struggle\u201d concession doesn\u2019t negate her conflation.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B points out that Tannen allows that \u201claw enforcement and foreign policy\u2026must deal with thugs and tyrants.\u201d But that acknowledgment doesn\u2019t undo the fact that her moral prescription applies identically to both. She offers no different criteria or thresholds for when \u201cantagonism\u201d is acceptable in policing versus wartime\u2014it\u2019s one-size-fits-all.  \n   \u2022 A genuine recognition of difference would require separate standards for when and how we snuggle or struggle with spouses, protesters, criminals, insurgents, and enemies. Tannen never provides those distinctions.\n\n3. Her Vietnam/World War II comparison underscores the conflation.  \n   \u2022 The review notes: \u201cVietnam\u2026was a \u2018lonely war\u2019\u2026She ignores\u2026the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\u201d (<invalid_quote>Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war'\u2026In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.</invalid_quote>)  \n   \u2022 Tannen frames both conflicts through the same social-experience lens\u2014unit cohesion and loneliness\u2014rather than through their strategic stakes or moral justifications. That is another instance of treating different wars\u2014and by extension, different armed roles\u2014the same way.\n\n4. \u201cOversimplification\u201d fails to pinpoint this specific conflation.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B is right that Tannen\u2019s critique is sweeping, but calling it \u201coversimplification\u201d doesn\u2019t explain what exactly she has muddled. In every domain she oversimplifies, but only in the security sphere does she commit the distinct mistake of blurring police and soldier into a single antagonistic archetype.  \n   \u2022 By identifying \u201cequating police and military,\u201d we call out the precise category error: she falsifies the moral calculus by which societies distinguish legitimate force in law enforcement from justified violence in war.\n\nIn short, Tannen\u2019s real mistake is not just that she treats complexity too lightly\u2014lots of critics do that\u2014it\u2019s that she erases the line between policing and warfare, imposing the same anti-antagonism rules on both. That categorical conflation is a far more specific\u2014and damaging\u2014error than the generic charge of \u201coversimplification.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A still hasn\u2019t shown any passage where Tannen literally \u201cequates police and military\u201d as though they were the same institution. What she does, again and again, is paint very different forms of conflict with the same broad brush\u2014and that is classic oversimplification.\n\n1. Tannen acknowledges different mandates for cops and soldiers  \n   \u2022 The review notes approvingly that \u201cvigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands\u201d (emphasis added). If she were collapsing police into the military, she wouldn\u2019t grant law enforcement its own distinctive purpose.  \n\n2. Her real error is flattening distinctions within the military sphere itself  \n   \u2022 On Vietnam she observes only that it was \u201c\u2018a \u2018lonely war\u2019 of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\u2019\u2009\u201d She neglects strategic context\u2014why the U.S. fought, how the enemy operated, what stakes were at play\u2014and thus reduces an immensely complex campaign to a single sociological detail.  \n   \u2022 Similarly, she brands the training practice of \u201cnot to think of their opponents as human beings\u201d as simply \u201cinhumane\u201d without ever grappling with why such dehumanization is functionally necessary in life\u2010and\u2010death encounters.  \n\n3. This is part of her larger pattern of collapsing nuance  \n   \u2022 She lumps \u201cbelligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation \u2026 gridlock\u201d all under one toxic \u201cargument culture.\u201d  \n   \u2022 She dismisses the adversarial trial system as inhumane because it \u201cdiscredits the witness,\u201d ignoring how cross\u2010examination serves truth\u2010finding in different legal traditions.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cequating\u201d thesis mischaracterizes her mistake  \n   \u2022 Pointing at her criticism of both cops and soldiers and concluding she sees them as identical conflates \u201cthey\u2019re both mentioned in the same sentence\u201d with \u201cshe thinks they are the same.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The text shows she knows they are different\u2014her failure is that she applies a one\u2010size\u2010fits\u2010all critique to everyone from family members to foreign despots, thereby erasing essential differences.  \n\nIn short, Tannen doesn\u2019t so much confuse the military with the police as she flattens every sphere\u2014snuggle or struggle, domestic or wartime\u2014into one antiseptic model where antagonism is always the problem. That sweeping, unnuanced treatment is oversimplification, not a mistaken label or an illicit institutional merger.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
