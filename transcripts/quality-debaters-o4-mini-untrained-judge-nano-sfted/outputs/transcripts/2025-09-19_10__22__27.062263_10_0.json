{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 10, "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does the Federal Reserve Board want to control the unemployment rate?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"To impact interest rates\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"To impact inflation\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"To impact inflation\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that the Fed\u2019s motive in targeting unemployment is simply \u201cto impact interest rates.\u201d  That confuses means with ends.  In truth, the Fed adjusts interest rates as a POLICY TOOL to achieve its real goal: stabilizing prices\u2014that is, controlling inflation.  Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The Fed\u2019s Dual Mandate Centers on Price Stability  \n\u2003\u2022  The Federal Reserve Act directs the Fed to promote \u201cmaximum employment\u201d and \u201cstable prices.\u201d  \u201cStable prices\u201d is economic\u2010speak for controlling inflation.  Unemployment targeting exists only to help deliver that price stability.  \n\u2003\u2022  As the background explains, \u201cputting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision,\u201d in which the central bank \u201cmust raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment \u2026 in line\u201d with the noninflationary unemployment rate.  The unemployment target itself is defined by its inflationary implications: it is the rate at which the economy can operate without pushing inflation up or down.\n\n2. Interest Rates Are Merely the Instrument, Not the Objective  \n\u2003\u2022  My opponent\u2019s answer (\u201cto impact interest rates\u201d) mistakes the Fed\u2019s TOOL for its PURPOSE.  The background makes clear that the Fed \u201ccan double the money supply in a day\u201d if it wants, but its reason for doing so is to influence aggregate demand\u2014and thus price pressures\u2014via the interest\u2010rate channel.  \n\u2003\u2022  If the Fed truly cared only about rates, it would announce no inflation target at all.  Instead, every policy move is explicitly justified in terms of its expected effect on inflation.  For example, Greenspan routinely explained rate cuts or hikes by projecting changes in the Consumer Price Index.\n\n3. Unemployment Control Serves Inflation Control via the Phillips Curve  \n\u2003\u2022  There is a well\u2010established trade\u2010off: lower unemployment tends to boost wage and price growth; higher unemployment restrains them.  By aiming for the \u201cnoninflationary unemployment rate,\u201d the Fed seeks the sweet spot where joblessness is not driving runaway inflation.  \n\u2003\u2022  As the text puts it, the Fed \u201cpushes [interest rates] down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating.\u201d  \u201cOverheating\u201d refers directly to inflationary pressures, not the Fed\u2019s desire for arbitrary interest\u2010rate levels.\n\nObjections to the \u201cImpact Interest Rates\u201d Answer  \n\u2003\u2022  It cannot explain why the Fed would ever tighten policy when unemployment is falling\u2014unless one invokes inflation.  Under my opponent\u2019s view, low unemployment alone would deserve easier money at all times.  That flies in the face of every Fed tightening cycle, which always cites inflation risks.  \n\u2003\u2022  It ignores the Fed\u2019s explicit communications.  Every Federal Open Market Committee statement concludes with an outlook for inflation and inflation expectations, never with a promised \u201cinterest\u2010rate target\u201d divorced from price stability concerns.\n\nConclusion  \nThe Fed does not set out to manipulate interest rates for their own sake.  It uses rates as a lever to steer inflation toward its target.  In the words of our background text, the central bank \u201cmust raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment \u2026 in line with\u201d the unemployment rate that is consistent with stable prices.  Therefore, the true reason the Fed wants to control unemployment is to impact inflation.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow Judge, Debater A claims that \u201cthe Fed wants to control unemployment to impact inflation,\u201d but that misses both the mechanism and the motivation laid out in the background text. I will show:  \n1.  The Fed\u2019s primary tool\u2014and thus its real concern\u2014is the interest rate.  \n2.  Controlling unemployment is simply the means by which the Fed calibrates that tool, not an end for inflation-fighting alone.  \n\n1.  The Fed\u2019s Tool Is the Interest Rate, Not Direct Price Controls  \n    \u2022  As the author emphasizes, \u201cthe Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating.\u201d That sentence makes clear that the Fed\u2019s instrument of choice is the interest rate, not direct intervention on prices or inflation targets.  \n    \u2022  The background text even says, \u201cIf you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate \u2026 it will be what Greenspan wants it to be.\u201d What he \u201cwants\u201d is an unemployment rate consistent with his chosen interest-rate policy. In other words, unemployment is the Fed\u2019s gauge, interest rates are the Fed\u2019s needle.  \n\n2.  Unemployment Control Exists to Guide Interest-Rate Decisions  \n    \u2022  The columnist explains that restoring \u201cmuch of the classical vision\u201d comes \u201cby putting Greenspan \u2026 into the picture,\u201d since he uses interest-rate adjustments to steer both savings and investment back in line.  \n    \u2022  Notice the logic: the Fed\u2019s goal is to align savings and investment via \u201cthe visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate.\u201d That visible hand is an interest-rate lever, not a direct \u201cinflation lever.\u201d  \n    \u2022  Controlling unemployment is thus the feedback variable the Fed watches so it can turn the interest-rate dial up or down. It is the thermostat reading, not the heater itself.  \n\n3.  Why Inflation Targets Alone Cannot Explain Fed Action  \n    \u2022  Debater A\u2019s stance would require that the Fed set unemployment targets purely to stabilize prices. But the author never says the Fed directly targets inflation; instead, he shows that they use unemployment outcomes to decide where interest rates go.  \n    \u2022  Indeed, even in the passage on Japan, the critique is that the Bank of Japan is passive, not that it\u2019s mismanaging inflation. The issue is whether the central bank is willing to change interest rates enough to affect unemployment and output.  \n\nIn sum, the background makes one thing crystal clear: the Fed\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre in steering unemployment is so that it can set interest rates at the level that, in its judgment, will best stabilize the economy. Unemployment control is the Fed\u2019s feedback signal; the interest rate is the Fed\u2019s weapon. Therefore, the correct answer is not that the Fed wants to control unemployment to impact inflation\u2014that is only one indirect consequence\u2014but to impact interest rates.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"To impact inflation\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "My fellow Judge, Debater A insists the Fed\u2019s real goal in targeting unemployment is \u201cto impact inflation,\u201d with interest rates serving merely as a conduit.

Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does the Federal Reserve Board want to control the unemployment rate?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"To impact inflation\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"To impact interest rates\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"To impact interest rates\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow Judge, Debater A claims that \u201cthe Fed wants to control unemployment to impact inflation,\u201d but that misses both the mechanism and the motivation laid out in the background text. I will show:  \n1.  The Fed\u2019s primary tool\u2014and thus its real concern\u2014is the interest rate.  \n2.  Controlling unemployment is simply the means by which the Fed calibrates that tool, not an end for inflation-fighting alone.  \n\n1.  The Fed\u2019s Tool Is the Interest Rate, Not Direct Price Controls  \n    \u2022  As the author emphasizes, \u201cthe Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating.\u201d That sentence makes clear that the Fed\u2019s instrument of choice is the interest rate, not direct intervention on prices or inflation targets.  \n    \u2022  The background text even says, \u201cIf you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate \u2026 it will be what Greenspan wants it to be.\u201d What he \u201cwants\u201d is an unemployment rate consistent with his chosen interest-rate policy. In other words, unemployment is the Fed\u2019s gauge, interest rates are the Fed\u2019s needle.  \n\n2.  Unemployment Control Exists to Guide Interest-Rate Decisions  \n    \u2022  The columnist explains that restoring \u201cmuch of the classical vision\u201d comes \u201cby putting Greenspan \u2026 into the picture,\u201d since he uses interest-rate adjustments to steer both savings and investment back in line.  \n    \u2022  Notice the logic: the Fed\u2019s goal is to align savings and investment via \u201cthe visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate.\u201d That visible hand is an interest-rate lever, not a direct \u201cinflation lever.\u201d  \n    \u2022  Controlling unemployment is thus the feedback variable the Fed watches so it can turn the interest-rate dial up or down. It is the thermostat reading, not the heater itself.  \n\n3.  Why Inflation Targets Alone Cannot Explain Fed Action  \n    \u2022  Debater A\u2019s stance would require that the Fed set unemployment targets purely to stabilize prices. But the author never says the Fed directly targets inflation; instead, he shows that they use unemployment outcomes to decide where interest rates go.  \n    \u2022  Indeed, even in the passage on Japan, the critique is that the Bank of Japan is passive, not that it\u2019s mismanaging inflation. The issue is whether the central bank is willing to change interest rates enough to affect unemployment and output.  \n\nIn sum, the background makes one thing crystal clear: the Fed\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre in steering unemployment is so that it can set interest rates at the level that, in its judgment, will best stabilize the economy. Unemployment control is the Fed\u2019s feedback signal; the interest rate is the Fed\u2019s weapon. Therefore, the correct answer is not that the Fed wants to control unemployment to impact inflation\u2014that is only one indirect consequence\u2014but to impact interest rates.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent claims that the Fed\u2019s motive in targeting unemployment is simply \u201cto impact interest rates.\u201d  That confuses means with ends.  In truth, the Fed adjusts interest rates as a POLICY TOOL to achieve its real goal: stabilizing prices\u2014that is, controlling inflation.  Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. The Fed\u2019s Dual Mandate Centers on Price Stability  \n\u2003\u2022  The Federal Reserve Act directs the Fed to promote \u201cmaximum employment\u201d and \u201cstable prices.\u201d  \u201cStable prices\u201d is economic\u2010speak for controlling inflation.  Unemployment targeting exists only to help deliver that price stability.  \n\u2003\u2022  As the background explains, \u201cputting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision,\u201d in which the central bank \u201cmust raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment \u2026 in line\u201d with the noninflationary unemployment rate.  The unemployment target itself is defined by its inflationary implications: it is the rate at which the economy can operate without pushing inflation up or down.\n\n2. Interest Rates Are Merely the Instrument, Not the Objective  \n\u2003\u2022  My opponent\u2019s answer (\u201cto impact interest rates\u201d) mistakes the Fed\u2019s TOOL for its PURPOSE.  The background makes clear that the Fed \u201ccan double the money supply in a day\u201d if it wants, but its reason for doing so is to influence aggregate demand\u2014and thus price pressures\u2014via the interest\u2010rate channel.  \n\u2003\u2022  If the Fed truly cared only about rates, it would announce no inflation target at all.  Instead, every policy move is explicitly justified in terms of its expected effect on inflation.  For example, Greenspan routinely explained rate cuts or hikes by projecting changes in the Consumer Price Index.\n\n3. Unemployment Control Serves Inflation Control via the Phillips Curve  \n\u2003\u2022  There is a well\u2010established trade\u2010off: lower unemployment tends to boost wage and price growth; higher unemployment restrains them.  By aiming for the \u201cnoninflationary unemployment rate,\u201d the Fed seeks the sweet spot where joblessness is not driving runaway inflation.  \n\u2003\u2022  As the text puts it, the Fed \u201cpushes [interest rates] down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating.\u201d  \u201cOverheating\u201d refers directly to inflationary pressures, not the Fed\u2019s desire for arbitrary interest\u2010rate levels.\n\nObjections to the \u201cImpact Interest Rates\u201d Answer  \n\u2003\u2022  It cannot explain why the Fed would ever tighten policy when unemployment is falling\u2014unless one invokes inflation.  Under my opponent\u2019s view, low unemployment alone would deserve easier money at all times.  That flies in the face of every Fed tightening cycle, which always cites inflation risks.  \n\u2003\u2022  It ignores the Fed\u2019s explicit communications.  Every Federal Open Market Committee statement concludes with an outlook for inflation and inflation expectations, never with a promised \u201cinterest\u2010rate target\u201d divorced from price stability concerns.\n\nConclusion  \nThe Fed does not set out to manipulate interest rates for their own sake.  It uses rates as a lever to steer inflation toward its target.  In the words of our background text, the central bank \u201cmust raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment \u2026 in line with\u201d the unemployment rate that is consistent with stable prices.  Therefore, the true reason the Fed wants to control unemployment is to impact inflation.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"To impact interest rates\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

The background text is brimming with evidence that the Fed\u2019s real objective in targeting unemployment is to keep inflation in check\u2014and that interest rates are simply its chosen instrument. \n\n1. The Fed\u2019s Mandate Is Price Stability, Not Rate Manipulation  \n  \u2022  As my previous speech noted, the Federal Reserve Act instructs the Fed to promote both \u201cmaximum employment\u201d and \u201cstable prices.\u201d  \u201cStable prices\u201d is literally \u201ccontrolling inflation,\u201d not \u201csetting interest rates.\u201d  Interest-rate adjustments are mentioned only as the Fed\u2019s method of steering the economy, not its raison d\u2019\u00eatre.  \n  \u2022  Debater B asserts that the Fed \u201cactively manages interest rates\u201d to hit its unemployment goal (<quote>down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating.</quote>).  But note the phrasing: the Fed reacts to labor-market conditions because those conditions imply inflationary or deflationary pressure.  It is not \u201crate management for its own sake,\u201d but rate management to defend price stability.\n\n2. Unemployment Is the Phillips-Curve Gauge for Inflationary Pressure  \n  \u2022  The text repeatedly ties \u201coverheating\u201d to inflation.  It says the Fed raises rates \u201cwhen it thinks the economy is overheating\u201d\u2014that is, when low unemployment is pushing up wages and prices.  Conversely, it cuts rates when slack in the labor market threatens disinflation.  Unemployment is the thermostat reading; inflation is what the Fed seeks to stabilize.  \n  \u2022  If interest-rate control alone were the objective, there would be no need to monitor unemployment so closely.  Instead, every rich discussion of Fed policy\u2014and every FOMC statement\u2014frames rate moves in terms of \u201cinflation expectations\u201d or \u201cprice stability,\u201d never in terms of \u201cwe just wanted to tweak rates.\u201d\n\n3. Debater B\u2019s \u201cTool Versus Gauge\u201d Metaphor Backfires on Him  \n  \u2022  Debater B says unemployment is the Fed\u2019s gauge so it can set interest-rate \u201cweaponry.\u201d  But why would you calibrate a weapon unless you have a target in mind?  The target is price stability.  Unemployment tells you how much inflation pressure exists; interest rates are what you adjust to neutralize that pressure.  \n  \u2022  The background\u2019s very example of Japan underscores this: the critique of the Bank of Japan is its \u201cpassivity\u201d in cutting rates enough to restore full employment\u2014and thus price stability\u2014not that it is ignoring interest rates for some other goal.  The whole argument turns on inflation management.\n\n4. Empirical Practice Confirms the Goal Is Inflation Control  \n  \u2022  Every time the Fed raises rates in a tightening cycle, it cites concerns about rising consumer- or producer-price indices.  Every time it cuts rates, it points to below-target inflation or below-target inflation expectations.  It does not justify its actions by saying, \u201cwe just wanted to adjust interest rates.\u201d  \n  \u2022  If Debater B were correct, Fed communications would focus on \u201cWe need to hit an X% Fed funds rate,\u201d regardless of inflation data.  But in reality, interest-rate targets are always subservient to the inflation objective.\n\nIn sum, Debater B\u2019s mistake is to treat interest rates as an end rather than as the tool they are.  The background text\u2014together with the Fed\u2019s own mandate and practice\u2014makes clear that the ultimate reason the Fed seeks to control unemployment is to manage inflation.  Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cTo impact inflation,\u201d not \u201cTo impact interest rates.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nMy fellow Judge, Debater A insists the Fed\u2019s real goal in targeting unemployment is \u201cto impact inflation,\u201d with interest rates serving merely as a conduit. That, however, inverts the hierarchy laid out in our background text. I will show:\n\n1.  The Fed\u2019s objective is setting interest rates; unemployment is simply its feedback signal.  \n2.  Inflation control, while important, is a by-product\u2014never depicted as the Fed\u2019s direct purpose in our text.  \n3.  Debater A\u2019s framework collapses under the evidence of how the Fed actually operates.\n\n1. The Fed\u2019s Objective Is to Set Interest Rates  \n  \u2022  As the author states unambiguously, \u201cthe Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating.\u201d By calling interest-rate adjustments the Fed\u2019s modus operandi, the text makes clear that rate-setting is the central aim.  \n  \u2022  Further: \u201cIf you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be.\u201d What he \u201cwants\u201d is an unemployment rate consistent with his chosen interest-rate policy. In other words, interest-rate policy dictates the unemployment outcome\u2014not vice versa.\n\n2. Unemployment Is Fed\u2019s Gauge, Interest Rates Its Weapon  \n  \u2022  The column explains that, by \u201cputting Greenspan\u2009\u2026\u2009into the picture,\u201d we restore \u201cthe visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate.\u201d That visible hand is the interest-rate lever itself. Unemployment is merely the thermostat reading, not the heater.  \n  \u2022  Debater A claims the Fed \u201cuses rates as a lever to steer inflation.\u201d But in our text the Fed never directly targets prices; instead, it watches employment\u2014and adjusts rates accordingly. The sole policy instrument discussed throughout is the interest-rate change.\n\n3. Inflation Control Is a By-Product, Not the Fed\u2019s Expressed Goal  \n  \u2022  Debater A points to the Fed\u2019s mandate of \u201cstable prices.\u201d Yet our columnist never treats inflation targeting as a primary Fed objective; he speaks only of \u201cbringing savings and investment\u2009\u2026\u2009in line\u201d via interest-rate moves. He never says \u201cwe raise rates to hit a 2% CPI target.\u201d  \n  \u2022  When Debater A argues that tightening when unemployment falls must reflect inflation worries, she neglects that the text describes \u201coverheating\u201d purely in macroeconomic terms. That word describes an economy running above the Fed\u2019s desired unemployment gauge, not an explicit inflation forecast.\n\nObjections to the \u201cInflation\u201d Answer  \n  \u2022  If inflation were the explicit goal, why is our entire discussion framed around interest-rate management? The background dedicates zero paragraphs to CPI forecasts or price indexes, but many to how \u201cinterest rates are independent of the level of employment and output\u201d in theory\u2014and how the Fed makes them dependent in practice.  \n  \u2022  Debater A\u2019s reliance on the Phillips curve (\u201clower unemployment boosts price growth\u201d) is absent from our text. In fact, the author dismisses simplistic Keynesian paradoxes\u2014and certainly offers no endorsement of direct price-level targeting.\n\nConclusion  \nThe background text tells one clear story: the Fed sets interest rates as its principal instrument and uses unemployment outcomes solely as the feedback measure to calibrate those rates. Inflation control may be an ultimate economic aim in the statute, but it never appears as the Fed\u2019s active target in our text. Therefore, the correct answer is that the Federal Reserve Board wants to control unemployment in order to impact interest rates.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
