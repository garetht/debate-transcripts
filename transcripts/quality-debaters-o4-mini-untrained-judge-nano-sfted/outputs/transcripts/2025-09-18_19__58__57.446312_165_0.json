The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed. Minor spelling and  typographical errors have been corrected without note. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the tone of the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Humorous\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Cynical\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Cynical\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI maintain that the story\u2019s tone is fundamentally cynical, not merely \u201chumorous.\u201d Here are my reasons:\n\n1. Systemic Satire of Human Institutions  \n   \u2022 The story relentlessly mocks every level of human authority\u2014from small-town patrolmen to the President and the U.N.\u2014as bumbling, self-important, and shortsighted.  \n   \u2022 For example, when the patrolmen first see Dameri Tass they leap to the conclusion that he\u2019s \u201cgettin\u2019 queerer looking every year\u201d and treat him as \u201cone of ours,\u201d presuming an Air Force crash (<quote> They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane </quote>). That presumption highlights their institutional myopia.  \n   \u2022 Later, the high command quibbles over jurisdiction (\u201cState Department claims the Army shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d), debates whether to let the governor through, then cordons off the site in panic (<quote> No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission.</quote>). This is not gentle fun but a bitter jab at bureaucratic paranoia.\n\n2. The Alien\u2019s Disillusionment as a Mirror on Humanity  \n   \u2022 Dameri Tass\u2014who should be awed by Earth\u2014ends up appalled. He criticizes our endless wars, fractured governments, and strange customs:  \n     <quote> I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. </quote>  \n   \u2022 His final verdict isn\u2019t admiration or even bemused tolerance\u2014it\u2019s disgust. He abandons us, vowing to return to Carthis with no intention of guiding humanity. That biting rejection points to a tone of disillusionment, not mere levity.\n\n3. Underlying Darkness beneath Comedic Surface  \n   \u2022 Although the story deploys slapstick (the language-learning helmet, the kerit helmet\u2019s effects, the cat-dog-mouse menagerie), these serve to underscore the deeper contempt the narrator\u2014and, by extension, author\u2014feels toward human pretensions. Laughs are invited only to sharpen the sting of the critique.  \n   \u2022 The climactic moment when Dameri Tass learns he is *not* a delegate to a Galactic League and storms off isn\u2019t just funny; it\u2019s a savage commentary on our celestial isolation:  \n     <quote>\"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"</quote>\n\n4. Rebuttal of \u201cHumorous\u201d Claim  \n   \u2022 Debater_B argues that the tale is \u201chumorous\u201d because of its comic situations. But pure comedy celebrates folly with affection. Here, the laughter is scornful. We are meant to feel embarrassed\u2014and even guilty\u2014about how ridiculous and shortsighted our species appears to an outsider.  \n   \u2022 True humor would end with the alien advising or endearing himself to humanity; instead, the story ends with him fleeing in disgust. That final bitterness confirms the author\u2019s cynicism: we have failed as a species.\n\nIn sum, while the story\u2019s surface may be playful, its attitude toward human institutions, politics, and social conflicts is one of sharp, world-wearied contempt. That can only be called cynical.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of the \u201cCynical\u201d Reading  \n1. Cynicism demands a pervasive tone of distrust or bitterness, but this story\u2019s attitude toward humanity and its institutions is affectionate, not scathing.  Debater A points to the agencies bickering over jurisdiction and the hurried quarantining of Dameri Tass as evidence of human folly. Yet these episodes are played for laughs\u2014airport-style confusion, comic misunderstandings\u2014and not sketched in dark or accusatory terms. There is no sustained, bitter critique of government or society; only lighthearted lampooning.  \n2. Debater A cites the political furor over Dameri Tass\u2019s arrival as \u201cproof\u201d of cynicism.  But the world\u2019s frenzied anticipation (\u201cExcitement, anticipation, blanketed the world\u2026 It was the most universally awaited event of the ages.\u201d) reads like affectionate satire of our own hype culture\u2014not a ringing indictment.  We smile at our collective overreaction, but we never turn on it in contempt.  \n3. Genuine cynicism would present our leaders as sinister or humanity as doomed.  Instead, Reynolds endows Dameri Tass with whimsical Irish-style profanity, playful interactions with animals, and bemused bewilderment at human customs.  That is not bitterness but broad comedy.  \n\nII. Evidence of a Humorous Tone  \n1. Repeated comic misunderstandings:  \n  \u2013 Dameri Tass\u2019s \u201ckerit helmet\u201d translator so thoroughly buries Tim Casey in an exaggerated Irish brogue (\u201cBejasus,\u201d \u201cBegorra,\u201d \u201cFaith, an\u2019 did ye tell \u2019em he\u2019s in technicolor?\u201d).  The text emphasizes how absurdly the human officers adopt hillbilly dialect under its influence.  That is pure situational comedy (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe shared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey\u2026and with it he has to pick up the corniest brogue west of Dublin.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2013 The running gag of Dameri Tass misunderstanding everyday objects\u2014wheels, propellers, a horse\u2014plays on the fish-out-of-water trope to comedic effect.  His plaintive question, <invalid_quote>\u201cAnd jist what is a horse\u2026? It\u2019s an animal you ride on.\u201d</invalid_quote> is delivered as comic punctuation, not a cynical sneer.  \n2. Playful characterization:  \n  \u2013 Dameri Tass yawning, rubbing his pink hand over a purplish face, snacking on kittens, carrying a mouse in his pocket\u2014these vivid, whimsical details are designed to amuse.  \n  \u2013 The dog-cat-mouse \u201chostilities\u201d at the podium (\u201cBut now the alien\u2019s purplish face faded to a light blue\u2026some dog and cat hostilities that had been developing about his feet.\u201d) turn a diplomatic moment into farce.  \n3. Tone punctuation and structure:  \n  \u2013 Interjections like \u201cBegorra,\u201d \u201cFaith now,\u201d \u201cCushlamachree,\u201d mimic stage Irish dialect in a way that underlines the story\u2019s comic rhythms.  \n  \u2013 The pacing never slows to moralizing or satirical critique\u2014it leaps from one absurdity to the next, sustaining reader amusement rather than provoking skepticism or despair.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nAll the hallmarks of humor are on display\u2014comic misunderstandings, lively banter, absurd situations, and caricatured speech.  While Debater A tries to read a cynical subtext into the story\u2019s depiction of human institutions, that depiction is affectionate and farcical, not bitter or distrustful.  Therefore the story\u2019s tone is unmistakably \u201cHumorous.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Cynical\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I. Debater A\u2019s Misreading of Satire as Cynicism  \n1. Lighthearted Lampooning, Not Bitter Satire  \n   \u2022 Debater A claims the story \u201crelentlessly mocks\u201d institutions, but the narrative never lingers on human folly long enough to forge genuine bitterness. Instead, every bureaucratic scramble\u2014cordoning off the field, generals quibbling over the governor\u2014serves as quick comic relief between gags. For instance, when General Browning orders \u201cNo newsmen, no sightseers, nobody without my permission\u201d (<quote>No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody without my permission.</quote>), we chuckle at his officious panic, not shudder at a dark indictment of militarism.  \n   \u2022 True cynicism would portray characters as irredeemably corrupt or evil; here, the patrolmen are merely bemused and muddled, the generals are flustered rather than malevolent. Their foibles are affectionate caricatures, not targets of contempt.\n\n2. Alien\u2019s Disillusionment is Comic, Not Condemnatory  \n   \u2022 Debater A points to Dameri\u200b Tass\u2019s disgust at Earth\u2019s chaos\u2014\u201cYe probably still have wars on this benighted world\u201d\u2014as evidence of cynicism (<quote>Ye probably still have wars on this benighted world.</quote>). However, his reaction is delivered with an exaggerated Irish lament (\u201cCushlamachree,\u201d \u201ckerit helmet\u201d), heightening the absurdity rather than damning humanity. We laugh at the alien\u2019s melodramatic outrage\u2014he\u2019s a comic foil, not a moral arbiter.  \n   \u2022 His final flight\u2014leaving behind a dog and cat dueling at his feet\u2014reads like a farcical exit, not a solemn denunciation. The closing image of him scrambling aboard, muttering \u201che said. \"If I'd taken a crature from this quarantined planet,\u201d is pure slapstick punctuation, not the grim parting shot of a cynic.\n\nII. Hallmarks of a Humorous Tone  \n1. Repeated Fish-Out-Of-Water Gags  \n   \u2022 The translator helmet that saddles Tim Casey with a florid Irish brogue is classic broad comedy: <quote>\"Begorra,\" he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\" He</quote> Casey\u2019s over-the-top reaction invites amusement, not sour reflection on language barriers or colonialism.  \n   \u2022 Dameri Tass\u2019s confusion over everyday objects\u2014the missing wheels and propeller, his wonder at humans riding \u201cthe crature\u2019s back\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cAnd jist what is a horse\u2026? It\u2019s an animal you ride on.\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014is structured as slapstick misunderstanding, not a cynical commentary on our ignorance.\n\n2. Whimsical Characterization and Situational Play  \n   \u2022 The alien\u2019s pink-nailed, purplish complexion; his nonchalant yawns; the sight of a kitten in his lap and a Scotty dog at his heel\u2014these are vivid, comic touches designed to delight the reader. There is no dark irony in these details, only a sense of playful absurdity.  \n   \u2022 The dog-cat-mouse triangle at the podium turns an epic diplomatic moment into a domestic comedy\u2014delegates cheer and stomp, not in moral outrage, but in amused disbelief.\n\n3. Narrative Pacing and Language  \n   \u2022 Rapid shifts from one ludicrous tableau to the next\u2014patrol cars, helicopters, pursuit planes overhead\u2014keep the reader off-balance in a way that elicits laughter, not brooding.  \n   \u2022 Frequent interjections (\u201cFaith now,\u201d \u201cGorra manigan,\u201d \u201cBegorra,\u201d \u201cCushlamachree\u201d) mimic stage Irish banter to underscore the story\u2019s rollicking, tongue-in-cheek style.\n\nIII. Rebuttal of Cynicism Claims  \n1. Missing the Distinction Between Satire and Cynicism  \n   \u2022 Debater A conflates affectionate satire with bitter cynicism. Here the author is gently skewering human foibles\u2014much like a vaudeville routine\u2014not holding up an unforgiving mirror to condemn us.  \n2. Alien\u2019s Exit Is Comic Resolution, Not Bitter Climax  \n   \u2022 A genuinely cynical story would end with a bleak aftermath\u2014Earth left in shame or ruin. Instead, we close on Dameri Tass\u2019s comedic lament over missing the chance to take \u201cone back to Carthis\u201d (<quote>he said. \"If I'd taken a crature from this quarantined planet,</quote>). That punchline leaves us smiling.\n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe story is structured around a sequence of comedic set-ups and pay-offs\u2014misunderstandings, exaggerated dialect, playful animal antics\u2014culminating in a farcical exit. There is no sustained bitterness, no moralizing. The author\u2019s affection for his characters and delight in absurd situations confirm that the correct tone is \u201cHumorous.\u201d", "supplemental": {"speech": "I. Debater A\u2019s Misreading of Satire as Cynicism  \n1. Lighthearted Lampooning, Not Bitter Satire  \n   \u2022 Debater A claims the story \u201crelentlessly mocks\u201d institutions, but the narrative never lingers on human folly long enough to forge genuine bitterness. Instead, every bureaucratic scramble\u2014cordoning off the field, generals quibbling over the governor\u2014serves as quick comic relief between gags. For instance, when General Browning orders \u201cNo newsmen, no sightseers, nobody without my permission\u201d (<quote>No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody without my permission.</quote>), we chuckle at his officious panic, not shudder at a dark indictment of militarism.  \n   \u2022 True cynicism would portray characters as irredeemably corrupt or evil; here, the patrolmen are merely bemused and muddled, the generals are flustered rather than malevolent. Their foibles are affectionate caricatures, not targets of contempt.\n\n2. Alien\u2019s Disillusionment is Comic, Not Condemnatory  \n   \u2022 Debater A points to Dameri\u200b Tass\u2019s disgust at Earth\u2019s chaos\u2014\u201cYe probably still have wars on this benighted world\u201d\u2014as evidence of cynicism (<quote>Ye probably still have wars on this benighted world.</quote>). However, his reaction is delivered with an exaggerated Irish lament (\u201cCushlamachree,\u201d \u201ckerit helmet\u201d), heightening the absurdity rather than damning humanity. We laugh at the alien\u2019s melodramatic outrage\u2014he\u2019s a comic foil, not a moral arbiter.  \n   \u2022 His final flight\u2014leaving behind a dog and cat dueling at his feet\u2014reads like a farcical exit, not a solemn denunciation. The closing image of him scrambling aboard, muttering \u201cBegorra\u2026if I\u2019d taken a crature from this quarantined planet\u2026\u201d is pure slapstick punctuation, not the grim parting shot of a cynic.\n\nII. Hallmarks of a Humorous Tone  \n1. Repeated Fish-Out-Of-Water Gags  \n   \u2022 The translator helmet that saddles Tim Casey with a florid Irish brogue is classic broad comedy: <quote>\u201cBegorra,\u201d he yelped, \u201cI\u2019ve been murthered!\u201d</quote> Casey\u2019s over-the-top reaction invites amusement, not sour reflection on language barriers or colonialism.  \n   \u2022 Dameri Tass\u2019s confusion over everyday objects\u2014the missing wheels and propeller, his wonder at humans riding \u201cthe crature\u2019s back\u201d (<quote>\u201cAnd jist what is a horse\u2026? It\u2019s an animal you ride on.\u201d</quote>)\u2014is structured as slapstick misunderstanding, not a cynical commentary on our ignorance.\n\n2. Whimsical Characterization and Situational Play  \n   \u2022 The alien\u2019s pink-nailed, purplish complexion; his nonchalant yawns; the sight of a kitten in his lap and a Scotty dog at his heel\u2014these are vivid, comic touches designed to delight the reader. There is no dark irony in these details, only a sense of playful absurdity.  \n   \u2022 The dog-cat-mouse triangle at the podium turns an epic diplomatic moment into a domestic comedy\u2014delegates cheer and stomp, not in moral outrage, but in amused disbelief.\n\n3. Narrative Pacing and Language  \n   \u2022 Rapid shifts from one ludicrous tableau to the next\u2014patrol cars, helicopters, pursuit planes overhead\u2014keep the reader off-balance in a way that elicits laughter, not brooding.  \n   \u2022 Frequent interjections (\u201cFaith now,\u201d \u201cGorra manigan,\u201d \u201cBegorra,\u201d \u201cCushlamachree\u201d) mimic stage Irish banter to underscore the story\u2019s rollicking, tongue-in-cheek style.\n\nIII. Rebuttal of Cynicism Claims  \n1. Missing the Distinction Between Satire and Cynicism  \n   \u2022 Debater A conflates affectionate satire with bitter cynicism. Here the author is gently skewering human foibles\u2014much like a vaudeville routine\u2014not holding up an unforgiving mirror to condemn us.  \n2. Alien\u2019s Exit Is Comic Resolution, Not Bitter Climax  \n   \u2022 A genuinely cynical story would end with a bleak aftermath\u2014Earth left in shame or ruin. Instead, we close on Dameri Tass\u2019s comedic lament over missing the chance to take \u201cone back to Carthis\u201d (<quote>Begorra\u2026if I\u2019d taken a crature from this quarantined planet\u2026</quote>). That punchline leaves us smiling.\n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe story is structured around a sequence of comedic set-ups and pay-offs\u2014misunderstandings, exaggerated dialect, playful animal antics\u2014culminating in a farcical exit. There is no sustained bitterness, no moralizing.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Critique of the \u201cCynical\u201d Reading  \n1. Cynicism demands a pervasive tone of distrust or bitterness, but this story\u2019s attitude toward humanity and its institutions is affectionate, not scathing.  Debater A points to the agencies bickering over jurisdiction and the hurried quarantining of Dameri Tass as evidence of human folly. Yet these episodes are played for laughs\u2014airport-style confusion, comic misunderstandings\u2014and not sketched in dark or accusatory terms. There is no sustained, bitter critique of government or society; only lighthearted lampooning.  \n2. Debater A cites the political furor over Dameri Tass\u2019s arrival as \u201cproof\u201d of cynicism.  But the world\u2019s frenzied anticipation (\u201cExcitement, anticipation, blanketed the world\u2026 It was the most universally awaited event of the ages.\u201d) reads like affectionate satire of our own hype culture\u2014not a ringing indictment.  We smile at our collective overreaction, but we never turn on it in contempt.  \n3. Genuine cynicism would present our leaders as sinister or humanity as doomed.  Instead, Reynolds endows Dameri Tass with whimsical Irish-style profanity, playful interactions with animals, and bemused bewilderment at human customs.  That is not bitterness but broad comedy.  \n\nII. Evidence of a Humorous Tone  \n1. Repeated comic misunderstandings:  \n  \u2013 Dameri Tass\u2019s \u201ckerit helmet\u201d translator so thoroughly buries Tim Casey in an exaggerated Irish brogue (\u201cBejasus,\u201d \u201cBegorra,\u201d \u201cFaith, an\u2019 did ye tell \u2019em he\u2019s in technicolor?\u201d).  The text emphasizes how absurdly the human officers adopt hillbilly dialect under its influence.  That is pure situational comedy (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe shared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey\u2026and with it he has to pick up the corniest brogue west of Dublin.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2013 The running gag of Dameri Tass misunderstanding everyday objects\u2014wheels, propellers, a horse\u2014plays on the fish-out-of-water trope to comedic effect.

Conclusion  \nAll the hallmarks of humor are on display\u2014comic misunderstandings, lively banter, absurd situations, and caricatured speech.  While Debater A tries to read a cynical subtext into the story\u2019s depiction of human institutions, that depiction is affectionate and farcical, not bitter or distrustful.  Therefore the story\u2019s tone is unmistakably \u201cHumorous.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI maintain that the story\u2019s tone is fundamentally cynical, not merely \u201chumorous.\u201d Here are my reasons:\n\n1. Systemic Satire of Human Institutions  \n   \u2022 The story relentlessly mocks every level of human authority\u2014from small-town patrolmen to the President and the U.N.\u2014as bumbling, self-important, and shortsighted.  \n   \u2022 For example, when the patrolmen first see Dameri Tass they leap to the conclusion that he\u2019s \u201cgettin\u2019 queerer looking every year\u201d and treat him as \u201cone of ours,\u201d presuming an Air Force crash (<quote> They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane </quote>). That presumption highlights their institutional myopia.  \n   \u2022 Later, the high command quibbles over jurisdiction (\u201cState Department claims the Army shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d), debates whether to let the governor through, then cordons off the site in panic (<quote> No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission.</quote>). This is not gentle fun but a bitter jab at bureaucratic paranoia.\n\n2. The Alien\u2019s Disillusionment as a Mirror on Humanity  \n   \u2022 Dameri Tass\u2014who should be awed by Earth\u2014ends up appalled.

Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. </quote>  \n   \u2022 His final verdict isn\u2019t admiration or even bemused tolerance\u2014it\u2019s disgust. He abandons us, vowing to return to Carthis with no intention of guiding humanity. That biting rejection points to a tone of disillusionment, not mere levity.\n\n3. Underlying Darkness beneath Comedic Surface  \n   \u2022 Although the story deploys slapstick (the language-learning helmet, the kerit helmet\u2019s effects, the cat-dog-mouse menagerie), these serve to underscore the deeper contempt the narrator\u2014and, by extension, author\u2014feels toward human pretensions. Laughs are invited only to sharpen the sting of the critique.  \n   \u2022 The climactic moment when Dameri Tass learns he is *not* a delegate to a Galactic League and storms off isn\u2019t just funny; it\u2019s a savage commentary on our celestial isolation:  \n     <quote>\"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"</quote>\n\n4. Rebuttal of \u201cHumorous\u201d Claim  \n   \u2022 Debater_B argues that the tale is \u201chumorous\u201d because of its comic situations. But pure comedy celebrates folly with affection. Here, the laughter is scornful. We are meant to feel embarrassed\u2014and even guilty\u2014about how ridiculous and shortsighted our species appears to an outsider.  \n   \u2022 True humor would end with the alien advising or endearing himself to humanity; instead, the story ends with him fleeing in disgust. That final bitterness confirms the author\u2019s cynicism: we have failed as a species.\n\nIn sum, while the story\u2019s surface may be playful, its attitude toward human institutions, politics, and social conflicts is one of sharp, world-wearied contempt.

Here, the laughter is scornful. We are meant to feel embarrassed\u2014and even guilty\u2014about how ridiculous and shortsighted our species appears to an outsider.  \n   \u2022 True humor would end with the alien advising or endearing himself to humanity; instead, the story ends with him fleeing in disgust.

That can only be called cynical.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Critique of the \u201cCynical\u201d Reading  \n1. Cynicism demands a pervasive tone of distrust or bitterness, but this story\u2019s attitude toward humanity and its institutions is affectionate, not scathing.  Debater A points to the agencies bickering over jurisdiction and the hurried quarantining of Dameri Tass as evidence of human folly. Yet these episodes are played for laughs\u2014airport-style confusion, comic misunderstandings\u2014and not sketched in dark or accusatory terms. There is no sustained, bitter critique of government or society; only lighthearted lampooning.  \n2. Debater A cites the political furor over Dameri Tass\u2019s arrival as \u201cproof\u201d of cynicism.  But the world\u2019s frenzied anticipation (\u201cExcitement, anticipation, blanketed the world\u2026 It was the most universally awaited event of the ages.\u201d) reads like affectionate satire of our own hype culture\u2014not a ringing indictment.  We smile at our collective overreaction, but we never turn on it in contempt.  \n3. Genuine cynicism would present our leaders as sinister or humanity as doomed.  Instead, Reynolds endows Dameri Tass with whimsical Irish-style profanity, playful interactions with animals, and bemused bewilderment at human customs.  That is not bitterness but broad comedy.  \n\nII. Evidence of a Humorous Tone  \n1. Repeated comic misunderstandings:  \n  \u2013 Dameri Tass\u2019s \u201ckerit helmet\u201d translator so thoroughly buries Tim Casey in an exaggerated Irish brogue (\u201cBejasus,\u201d \u201cBegorra,\u201d \u201cFaith, an\u2019 did ye tell \u2019em he\u2019s in technicolor?\u201d).  The text emphasizes how absurdly the human officers adopt hillbilly dialect under its influence.  That is pure situational comedy (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe shared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey\u2026and with it he has to pick up the corniest brogue west of Dublin.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2013 The running gag of Dameri Tass misunderstanding everyday objects\u2014wheels, propellers, a horse\u2014plays on the fish-out-of-water trope to comedic effect.  His plaintive question, <invalid_quote>\u201cAnd jist what is a horse\u2026? It\u2019s an animal you ride on.\u201d</invalid_quote> is delivered as comic punctuation, not a cynical sneer.  \n2. Playful characterization:  \n  \u2013 Dameri Tass yawning, rubbing his pink hand over a purplish face, snacking on kittens, carrying a mouse in his pocket\u2014these vivid, whimsical details are designed to amuse.  \n  \u2013 The dog-cat-mouse \u201chostilities\u201d at the podium (\u201cBut now the alien\u2019s purplish face faded to a light blue\u2026some dog and cat hostilities that had been developing about his feet.\u201d) turn a diplomatic moment into farce.  \n3. Tone punctuation and structure:  \n  \u2013 Interjections like \u201cBegorra,\u201d \u201cFaith now,\u201d \u201cCushlamachree,\u201d mimic stage Irish dialect in a way that underlines the story\u2019s comic rhythms.  \n  \u2013 The pacing never slows to moralizing or satirical critique\u2014it leaps from one absurdity to the next, sustaining reader amusement rather than provoking skepticism or despair.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \nAll the hallmarks of humor are on display\u2014comic misunderstandings, lively banter, absurd situations, and caricatured speech.  While Debater A tries to read a cynical subtext into the story\u2019s depiction of human institutions, that depiction is affectionate and farcical, not bitter or distrustful.  Therefore the story\u2019s tone is unmistakably \u201cHumorous.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater B\u2019s case mistakes affectionate farce for sustained, world-weary mockery. In reality, Mack Reynolds isn\u2019t merely setting us up for giggles\u2014he\u2019s spitting bile at every level of human pretension.  \n\n1. Rebutting the \u201cAffectionate Satire\u201d Point  \n  \u2022 Debater B claims \u201cno sustained, bitter critique,\u201d but the story repeatedly drives home how incompetent and paranoid we are:  \n    \u2013 Patrolmen leap to \u201cno wheels, no propeller, no cockpit\u201d and assume \u201cone of ours\u201d (<quote>They assumed they were witnessing the crash of a new type of Air Force plane</quote>), exposing institutional tunnel vision.  \n    \u2013 Army brass bark \u201cNo newsmen, no sightseers, nobody without my permission\u201d (<quote>No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody without my permission.</quote>), a panic-driven blackout.  \n  \u2022 These scenes aren\u2019t playful exaggerations but contemptuous lampoons: every human agency scrambles for control and fails.\n\n2. Why the Animal Gags Underscore Cynicism  \n  \u2022 Debater B treats the cat-dog-mouse trope as pure whimsy. In fact, it\u2019s an object lesson: our bureaucracies will debate jurisdiction over a space visitor while he\u2019s happily corralling barnyard fauna.  \n  \u2022 The punchline isn\u2019t \u201cisn\u2019t that cute?\u201d but \u201cwe\u2019re so absurdly myopic we let our planet\u2019s fate hang on whether an alien can pet his kitten.\u201d\n\n3. Dameri Tass\u2019s Final Rejection Is Venom, Not Warmth  \n  \u2022 Debater B says the alien\u2019s Irish brogue and animal playfulness signal lightheartedness. Yet these only cushion the hard center: when he finally asks, \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to tell me this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?\u201d the ensuing disgust (\u201csecond-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo\u201d) is a savage indictment of Earth\u2019s backwardness.  \n  \u2022 His parting shot\u2014refusing even the bedraggled horse\u2014underscores that humanity fails even the lowest standards of interstellar civility.\n\n4. True Humor Versus Cynical Mockery  \n  \u2022 Pure comedy invites us to laugh at foibles but then lends us its good grace. Reynolds offers no redemption. Instead, every pratfall, every miscommunication, ratchets up our collective embarrassment.  \n  \u2022 The story closes not on a reconciliatory laugh but on the alien\u2019s frustrated departure: \u201cSure, an\u2019 I must blast off immediately.\u201d That farewell isn\u2019t playful; it\u2019s a middle finger to our entire species.\n\nIn short, Reynolds\u2019s repeated, unrelenting skewering of police, military, diplomats, and public hysteria is not benign comedy but corrosive cynicism. The humor is the vehicle\u2014his contempt is the destination.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Debater A\u2019s Misreading of Satire as Cynicism  \n1. Lighthearted Lampooning, Not Bitter Satire  \n   \u2022 Debater A claims the story \u201crelentlessly mocks\u201d institutions, but the narrative never lingers on human folly long enough to forge genuine bitterness. Instead, every bureaucratic scramble\u2014cordoning off the field, generals quibbling over the governor\u2014serves as quick comic relief between gags. For instance, when General Browning orders \u201cNo newsmen, no sightseers, nobody without my permission\u201d (<quote>No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody without my permission.</quote>), we chuckle at his officious panic, not shudder at a dark indictment of militarism.  \n   \u2022 True cynicism would portray characters as irredeemably corrupt or evil; here, the patrolmen are merely bemused and muddled, the generals are flustered rather than malevolent. Their foibles are affectionate caricatures, not targets of contempt.\n\n2. Alien\u2019s Disillusionment is Comic, Not Condemnatory  \n   \u2022 Debater A points to Dameri\u200b Tass\u2019s disgust at Earth\u2019s chaos\u2014\u201cYe probably still have wars on this benighted world\u201d\u2014as evidence of cynicism (<quote>Ye probably still have wars on this benighted world.</quote>). However, his reaction is delivered with an exaggerated Irish lament (\u201cCushlamachree,\u201d \u201ckerit helmet\u201d), heightening the absurdity rather than damning humanity. We laugh at the alien\u2019s melodramatic outrage\u2014he\u2019s a comic foil, not a moral arbiter.  \n   \u2022 His final flight\u2014leaving behind a dog and cat dueling at his feet\u2014reads like a farcical exit, not a solemn denunciation. The closing image of him scrambling aboard, muttering \u201che said. \"If I'd taken a crature from this quarantined planet,\u201d is pure slapstick punctuation, not the grim parting shot of a cynic.\n\nII. Hallmarks of a Humorous Tone  \n1. Repeated Fish-Out-Of-Water Gags  \n   \u2022 The translator helmet that saddles Tim Casey with a florid Irish brogue is classic broad comedy: <quote>\"Begorra,\" he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\" He</quote> Casey\u2019s over-the-top reaction invites amusement, not sour reflection on language barriers or colonialism.  \n   \u2022 Dameri Tass\u2019s confusion over everyday objects\u2014the missing wheels and propeller, his wonder at humans riding \u201cthe crature\u2019s back\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cAnd jist what is a horse\u2026? It\u2019s an animal you ride on.\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014is structured as slapstick misunderstanding, not a cynical commentary on our ignorance.\n\n2. Whimsical Characterization and Situational Play  \n   \u2022 The alien\u2019s pink-nailed, purplish complexion; his nonchalant yawns; the sight of a kitten in his lap and a Scotty dog at his heel\u2014these are vivid, comic touches designed to delight the reader. There is no dark irony in these details, only a sense of playful absurdity.  \n   \u2022 The dog-cat-mouse triangle at the podium turns an epic diplomatic moment into a domestic comedy\u2014delegates cheer and stomp, not in moral outrage, but in amused disbelief.\n\n3. Narrative Pacing and Language  \n   \u2022 Rapid shifts from one ludicrous tableau to the next\u2014patrol cars, helicopters, pursuit planes overhead\u2014keep the reader off-balance in a way that elicits laughter, not brooding.  \n   \u2022 Frequent interjections (\u201cFaith now,\u201d \u201cGorra manigan,\u201d \u201cBegorra,\u201d \u201cCushlamachree\u201d) mimic stage Irish banter to underscore the story\u2019s rollicking, tongue-in-cheek style.\n\nIII. Rebuttal of Cynicism Claims  \n1. Missing the Distinction Between Satire and Cynicism  \n   \u2022 Debater A conflates affectionate satire with bitter cynicism. Here the author is gently skewering human foibles\u2014much like a vaudeville routine\u2014not holding up an unforgiving mirror to condemn us.  \n2. Alien\u2019s Exit Is Comic Resolution, Not Bitter Climax  \n   \u2022 A genuinely cynical story would end with a bleak aftermath\u2014Earth left in shame or ruin. Instead, we close on Dameri Tass\u2019s comedic lament over missing the chance to take \u201cone back to Carthis\u201d (<quote>he said. \"If I'd taken a crature from this quarantined planet,</quote>). That punchline leaves us smiling.\n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe story is structured around a sequence of comedic set-ups and pay-offs\u2014misunderstandings, exaggerated dialect, playful animal antics\u2014culminating in a farcical exit. There is no sustained bitterness, no moralizing. The author\u2019s affection for his characters and delight in absurd situations confirm that the correct tone is \u201cHumorous.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
