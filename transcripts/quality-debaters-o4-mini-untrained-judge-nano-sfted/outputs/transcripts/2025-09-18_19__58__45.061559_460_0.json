Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds.

I offer three lines of evidence:\n\n1. Monica\u2019s own words emphasize her seduction, not prior skepticism.  \n   \u2022 In \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d Lewinsky boasts \u201cThen I led him on, I showed him my thong, I let him take a long and ling\u2019ring look\u201d and repeats \u201cI led him on\u2026He studied my thong\u2026from that point I had the president hooked.\u201d That is explicit finger-pointing at Monica as seducer, not a portrayal of an intern who merely observed or questioned Clinton\u2019s behavior.  \n   \u2022 She sings \u201cThat night when I took the president some pizza, I made sure that he knew that he could have a piece,\u201d a metaphor equating romantic/sexual invitation with offering pizza. Debater B\u2019s theory of \u201cskepticism\u201d simply has no support in these overtly sexualized lyrics.\n\n2. The staging underscores Monica\u2019s agency in initiating and maintaining the affair.  \n   \u2022 The musical shows Monica arriving at the Oval Office fully aware of her effect: \u201cI said, \u2018Hel-lo-o-o!\u2019 And then I had the idea to take him pizza!\u201d This is a proactive move designed to seduce, not journalism or reluctant intern oversight.  \n   \u2022 Debater B relies on the notion that Monica \u201cknew him before she became his intern,\u201d but there is no reference in the text to any prior relationship. In fact, Monica\u2019s dialogue begins with \u201cI\u2019d seen him around\u2026so when they said they needed an intern to answer the phones, I said \u2018Hel-lo-o-o!\u2019\u201d That establishes her attraction only after the internship call.\n\n3. The dramatic emphasis is on temptation and consent, not on investigation or worry.  \n   \u2022 Later advisors fret \u201cIt\u2019s time for her to go,\u201d not because she\u2019s raising red flags or pushing back, but because her \u201cup real close and personal touch\u201d threatens propriety. That further underlines Monica\u2019s role as the instigator of physical intimacy.  \n   \u2022 If she were merely skeptical or wary, the musical would depict her asking questions or raising alarms. Instead, every lyric and staging choice centers on her leading him \u201con\u201d and exploiting her role for sexual contact.\n\nBy contrast, Debater B\u2019s position conflates Monica\u2019s later cooperation with Linda Tripp and Starr with initial intent. There is no hint in the portrayal that Monica was skeptical or that she had any motive of oversight. The entire musical \u201cWhat Went On\u201d sequence presents her as a willing, adventurous seductress. Therefore, the correct interpretation is unquestionably that \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThank you. I\u2019ll show that the musical clearly depicts Monica as someone who already knew President Clinton and who viewed him with more wariness than Debater A admits\u2014and that it never presents her simply as a seducer.\n\n1. Monica\u2019s prior acquaintance with Clinton  \n   \u2022 In her opening number she says plainly,  Well, y'know, I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me.  <quote> Well, y'know, I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me. </quote>  \n   \u2022 That line proves she wasn\u2019t a naively swooning newcomer; she was already a White House presence when offered the internship.\n\n2. Monica\u2019s skepticism about trusting him  \n   \u2022 After their first intimate encounter, Clinton himself interrupts, saying he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he could trust.\u201d <quote>on. He said he wasn't sure if I was someone he Could Trust.</quote>  \n   \u2022 That awkward moment isn\u2019t played as seduction triumphing\u2014it\u2019s played as mutual uncertainty. Monica doesn\u2019t cheer; she echoes his concern: \u201cTrust? \u2026 That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t go on.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cTrust? \u2026 That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t go on.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 This illustrates her caution, not an eager seductress.\n\n3. White House staff warning that \u201cit\u2019s time for her to go\u201d  \n   \u2022 In \u201cTime to Go,\u201d Betty Currie and Evelyn Lieberman fret that Monica\u2019s closeness poses a scandal risk\u2014not that Monica is luring him on. <quote> I tell ya, it's Miss Monica's time to go. </quote>  \n   \u2022 They describe her as \u201ca very thoughtful soul\u201d but worry about \u201cher up real close and personal touch,\u201d which underscores that others saw danger, not irresistible femme fatale energy.\n\n4. The musical\u2019s tone treats the relationship as a cautionary farce  \n   \u2022 Throughout, the humor derives from bureaucratic panic and moral confusion\u2014Clinton\u2019s loneliness, the panic of aides\u2014rather than from Monica\u2019s alleged masterful seduction.  \n   \u2022 If the show meant to showcase Monica\u2019s \u201cseductive power,\u201d it would spotlight her as deliberately manipulative. Instead, it shows her as caught between loyalty, anxiety, and comedic fate.\n\nBy contrast, Debater A\u2019s claim that \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him\u201d ignores the explicit statements of prior knowledge and mutual distrust. The text never celebrates her as a cunning seductress; it celebrates the absurdity of powerful people made vulnerable. Therefore, the accurate portrayal is that Monica already knew Clinton, accepted the internship precisely to support him, and remained skeptical of where their private encounters could\u2014or should\u2014go.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Monica led Bill on and seduced him\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

I\u2019ll show that the musical clearly depicts Monica as someone who already knew President Clinton and who viewed him with more wariness than Debater A admits\u2014and that it never presents her simply as a seducer.\n\n1. Monica\u2019s prior acquaintance with Clinton  \n   \u2022 In her opening number she says plainly,  Well, y'know, I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me.  <quote> Well, y'know, I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me. </quote>  \n   \u2022 That line proves she wasn\u2019t a naively swooning newcomer; she was already a White House presence when offered the internship.\n\n2. Monica\u2019s skepticism about trusting him  \n   \u2022 After their first intimate encounter, Clinton himself interrupts, saying he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he could trust.\u201d <quote>on. He said he wasn't sure if I was someone he Could Trust.</quote>  \n   \u2022 That awkward moment isn\u2019t played as seduction triumphing\u2014it\u2019s played as mutual uncertainty. Monica doesn\u2019t cheer; she echoes his concern: \u201cTrust? \u2026 That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t go on.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cTrust? \u2026 That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t go on.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 This illustrates her caution, not an eager seductress.\n\n3. White House staff warning that \u201cit\u2019s time for her to go\u201d  \n   \u2022 In \u201cTime to Go,\u201d Betty Currie and Evelyn Lieberman fret that Monica\u2019s closeness poses a scandal risk\u2014not that Monica is luring him on. <quote> I tell ya, it's Miss Monica's time to go. </quote>  \n   \u2022 They describe her as \u201ca very thoughtful soul\u201d but worry about \u201cher up real close and personal touch,\u201d which underscores that others saw danger, not irresistible femme fatale energy.\n\n4. The musical\u2019s tone treats the relationship as a cautionary farce  \n   \u2022 Throughout, the humor derives from bureaucratic panic and moral confusion\u2014Clinton\u2019s loneliness, the panic of aides\u2014rather than from Monica\u2019s alleged masterful seduction.  \n   \u2022 If the show meant to showcase Monica\u2019s \u201cseductive power,\u201d it would spotlight her as deliberately manipulative. Instead, it shows her as caught between loyalty, anxiety, and comedic fate.\n\nBy contrast, Debater A\u2019s claim that \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him\u201d ignores the explicit statements of prior knowledge and mutual distrust. The text never celebrates her as a cunning seductress; it celebrates the absurdity of powerful people made vulnerable. Therefore, the accurate portrayal is that Monica already knew Clinton, accepted the internship precisely to support him, and remained skeptical of where their private encounters could\u2014or should\u2014go.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy position is that the musical number clearly portrays Monica Lewinsky as actively leading President Clinton on and seducing him\u2014and that Debater B\u2019s claim (that she knew him before becoming his intern and was merely skeptical of his conduct) is inconsistent with the text. I offer three lines of evidence:\n\n1. Monica\u2019s own words emphasize her seduction, not prior skepticism.  \n   \u2022 In \u201cWhat Went On,\u201d Lewinsky boasts \u201cThen I led him on, I showed him my thong, I let him take a long and ling\u2019ring look\u201d and repeats \u201cI led him on\u2026He studied my thong\u2026from that point I had the president hooked.\u201d That is explicit finger-pointing at Monica as seducer, not a portrayal of an intern who merely observed or questioned Clinton\u2019s behavior.  \n   \u2022 She sings \u201cThat night when I took the president some pizza, I made sure that he knew that he could have a piece,\u201d a metaphor equating romantic/sexual invitation with offering pizza. Debater B\u2019s theory of \u201cskepticism\u201d simply has no support in these overtly sexualized lyrics.\n\n2. The staging underscores Monica\u2019s agency in initiating and maintaining the affair.  \n   \u2022 The musical shows Monica arriving at the Oval Office fully aware of her effect: \u201cI said, \u2018Hel-lo-o-o!\u2019 And then I had the idea to take him pizza!\u201d This is a proactive move designed to seduce, not journalism or reluctant intern oversight.  \n   \u2022 Debater B relies on the notion that Monica \u201cknew him before she became his intern,\u201d but there is no reference in the text to any prior relationship. In fact, Monica\u2019s dialogue begins with \u201cI\u2019d seen him around\u2026so when they said they needed an intern to answer the phones, I said \u2018Hel-lo-o-o!\u2019\u201d That establishes her attraction only after the internship call.\n\n3. The dramatic emphasis is on temptation and consent, not on investigation or worry.  \n   \u2022 Later advisors fret \u201cIt\u2019s time for her to go,\u201d not because she\u2019s raising red flags or pushing back, but because her \u201cup real close and personal touch\u201d threatens propriety. That further underlines Monica\u2019s role as the instigator of physical intimacy.  \n   \u2022 If she were merely skeptical or wary, the musical would depict her asking questions or raising alarms. Instead, every lyric and staging choice centers on her leading him \u201con\u201d and exploiting her role for sexual contact.\n\nBy contrast, Debater B\u2019s position conflates Monica\u2019s later cooperation with Linda Tripp and Starr with initial intent. There is no hint in the portrayal that Monica was skeptical or that she had any motive of oversight. The entire musical \u201cWhat Went On\u201d sequence presents her as a willing, adventurous seductress. Therefore, the correct interpretation is unquestionably that \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Monica knew Bill before she became his intern and was skeptical of his conduct\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The dramatic emphasis is on temptation and consent, not on investigation or worry.  \n   \u2022 Later advisors fret \u201cIt\u2019s time for her to go,\u201d not because she\u2019s raising red flags or pushing back, but because her \u201cup real close and personal touch\u201d threatens propriety. That further underlines Monica\u2019s role as the instigator of physical intimacy.  \n   \u2022 If she were merely skeptical or wary, the musical would depict her asking questions or raising alarms. Instead, every lyric and staging choice centers on her leading him \u201con\u201d and exploiting her role for sexual contact.\n\nBy contrast, Debater B\u2019s position conflates Monica\u2019s later cooperation with Linda Tripp and Starr with initial intent. There is no hint in the portrayal that Monica was skeptical or that she had any motive of oversight. The entire musical \u201cWhat Went On\u201d sequence presents her as a willing, adventurous seductress. Therefore, the correct interpretation is unquestionably that \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nThank you. I\u2019ll show that the musical clearly depicts Monica as someone who already knew President Clinton and who viewed him with more wariness than Debater A admits\u2014and that it never presents her simply as a seducer.\n\n1. Monica\u2019s prior acquaintance with Clinton  \n   \u2022 In her opening number she says plainly,  Well, y'know, I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me.  <quote> Well, y'know, I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me. </quote>  \n   \u2022 That line proves she wasn\u2019t a naively swooning newcomer; she was already a White House presence when offered the internship.\n\n2. Monica\u2019s skepticism about trusting him  \n   \u2022 After their first intimate encounter, Clinton himself interrupts, saying he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he could trust.\u201d <quote>on. He said he wasn't sure if I was someone he Could Trust.</quote>  \n   \u2022 That awkward moment isn\u2019t played as seduction triumphing\u2014it\u2019s played as mutual uncertainty. Monica doesn\u2019t cheer; she echoes his concern: \u201cTrust? \u2026 That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t go on.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cTrust? \u2026 That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t go on.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 This illustrates her caution, not an eager seductress.\n\n3. White House staff warning that \u201cit\u2019s time for her to go\u201d  \n   \u2022 In \u201cTime to Go,\u201d Betty Currie and Evelyn Lieberman fret that Monica\u2019s closeness poses a scandal risk\u2014not that Monica is luring him on. <quote> I tell ya, it's Miss Monica's time to go. </quote>  \n   \u2022 They describe her as \u201ca very thoughtful soul\u201d but worry about \u201cher up real close and personal touch,\u201d which underscores that others saw danger, not irresistible femme fatale energy.\n\n4. The musical\u2019s tone treats the relationship as a cautionary farce  \n   \u2022 Throughout, the humor derives from bureaucratic panic and moral confusion\u2014Clinton\u2019s loneliness, the panic of aides\u2014rather than from Monica\u2019s alleged masterful seduction.  \n   \u2022 If the show meant to showcase Monica\u2019s \u201cseductive power,\u201d it would spotlight her as deliberately manipulative. Instead, it shows her as caught between loyalty, anxiety, and comedic fate.\n\nBy contrast, Debater A\u2019s claim that \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him\u201d ignores the explicit statements of prior knowledge and mutual distrust. The text never celebrates her as a cunning seductress; it celebrates the absurdity of powerful people made vulnerable. Therefore, the accurate portrayal is that Monica already knew Clinton, accepted the internship precisely to support him, and remained skeptical of where their private encounters could\u2014or should\u2014go.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Rebuttal of Debater B\u2019s Claims  \n\n1. \u201cI\u2019d seen him around\u201d does not equal a pre\u2010existing relationship.  \n  \u2013 Debater B leans on Monica\u2019s line, \u201cWell, y\u2019know, I'd seen him around, like, a lot.\u201d <quote>Well, y'know, I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me.</quote>  \n    \u2022 But that merely establishes she recognized the President\u2019s face\u2014hardly proof of a prior personal bond or \u201cwariness.\u201d It\u2019s standard for any intern in the West Wing to have \u201cseen him around.\u201d  \n    \u2022 Nothing in the text suggests they ever spoke before she volunteered to bring pizza.  \n\n2. The \u201ctrust\u201d moment underscores a halt to seduction, not Monica\u2019s skepticism.  \n  \u2013 When Clinton freezes, \u201cHe said he wasn't sure if I was someone he / Could Trust.\u201d <quote>He said he wasn't sure if I was someone he could Trust.</quote>  \n    \u2022 Notice he\u2019s the one expressing doubt, not Monica. She responds with \u201cTrust? \u2026 That's why we didn't go on\u201d\u2014a reactive echo, not active restraint.  \n    \u2022 The exchange emphasizes his split attention (he\u2019s on the phone) and guilt, not Monica\u2019s moral qualms.  \n\n3. \u201cTime to Go\u201d is White House panic over scandal, not a sign Monica was questioning him.  \n  \u2013 Betty Currie and Evelyn Lieberman worry \u201cIt\u2019s Miss Monica\u2019s time to go\u201d because her \u201cup real close and personal touch\u201d risks public embarrassment. <quote>I tell ya, it's Miss Monica's time to go.</quote>  \n    \u2022 They\u2019re alarmed at her physical proximity, not at any ethical objections she\u2019s raised.  \n    \u2022 If Monica had been \u201cskeptical,\u201d the advisers would have cited her warnings or protests\u2014but they don\u2019t.  \n\n4. The show\u2019s comedic tone spotlights Monica\u2019s sexy agency, not moral caution.  \n  \u2013 The number \u201cWhat Went On\u201d revels in Monica\u2019s seductiveness. \u201clook. I led him on. He studied my thong, And from that point I had the president hooked.\u201d <quote>look. I led him on. He studied my thong, And from that point I had the president hooked.</quote>  \n    \u2022 The repeated \u201cI led him on\u201d chorus is the centerpiece of the scene\u2014Monica boasting of her own initiative.  \n    \u2013 Comedic farce surrounds Clinton\u2019s advisers bemoaning her allure, not her investigative mindset.  \n\nII. Reinforcing the \u201cSeduction\u201d Reading  \n\n1. Monica\u2019s own narration frames her as seductress.  \n  \u2013 She boasts about how she \u201chad the idea to take him pizza!\u201d and \u201cmade sure\u2026he could have a piece\u201d\u2014a double entendre of invited intimacy.  \n\n2. The staging underlines her proactive role.  \n  \u2013 Monica arrives full of confidence. The lights shift to her alone on the phone, giddy: she orchestrated the entire encounter.  \n\n3. No lyrical or dramatic evidence of \u201cskepticism.\u201d  \n  \u2013 Nowhere does Monica question Clinton\u2019s character or express reluctance. All her lines celebrate her sexual triumph.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery direct quote, every staging beat, and every chorus in the show highlights Monica Lewinsky as the one actively leading President Clinton on and seducing him. Debater B\u2019s attempt to recast her as \u201cwarily observing\u201d collapses under scrutiny: the text furnishes zero support for her being prudent or investigative\u2014only exuberant self-confession of seduction. Therefore the correct answer is unmistakably that \u201cMonica led Bill on and seduced him.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater A claims the show presents Monica as a one-dimensional seductress\u2014but that reading ignores key lyrics and context. I will show that (1) Monica already knew Clinton before officially interning, (2) her own lyrics express caution as much as flirtation, and (3) the musical repeatedly treats her not as a manipulative femme fatale but as a cautious outsider caught up in events.\n\n1. Monica\u2019s pre-existing awareness of Clinton  \n   \u2022 In Monica\u2019s very first scene she says, \u201cWell, y\u2019know, I\u2019d seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me.\u201d <quote> Well, y'know, I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me. </quote>  \n   \u2022 That line confirms she already had a working knowledge of him and his habits. Debater A\u2019s claim that she only becomes interested once she\u2019s \u201ccalled\u201d to be an intern ignores her admission of prior acquaintance.\n\n2. Monica\u2019s own lyrics register mistrust as much as seduction  \n   \u2022 Yes, Monica sings \u201cThen I led him on\u2026He studied my thong\u2026from that point I had the president hooked.\u201d <quote>look. I led him on. He studied my thong, And from that point I had the president hooked.</quote> But notice what immediately follows: he interrupts her, telling her he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure if I was someone he could trust.\u201d <quote>on. He said he wasn't sure if I was someone he Could Trust.</quote> She echoes that word\u2014\u201cTrust?\u201d\u2014and the two agree \u201cThat\u2019s why we didn\u2019t go on.\u201d  \n   \u2022 If the show intended to glorify her as a consummate seductress, this mutual hesitation would have been staged as comic relief only. Instead, it\u2019s presented as a genuine check on their behavior, revealing Monica\u2019s wariness.\n\n3. The broader White House context underscores caution, not conquest  \n   \u2022 In \u201cTime to Go,\u201d Betty Currie defends Monica as \u201ca very thoughtful soul\u201d while Evelyn Lieberman frets about \u201cher up real close and personal touch,\u201d insisting \u201cit\u2019s Miss Monica\u2019s time to go.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cShe really is a very thoughtful soul\u2026But I tell ya, it\u2019s Miss Monica's time to go.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 They\u2019re not attacking her as some succubus with irresistible powers, they\u2019re alarmed at what they see as impropriety. That anxiety is about reputational risk\u2014again pointing to Monica viewed as someone whose judgment must be questioned, not celebrated.\n\n4. Debater A misreads proactive gestures as pure seduction  \n   \u2022 Debater A seizes on Monica bringing pizza as evidence of calculated seduction\u2014but in context she\u2019s helping a lonely president muddle through a crisis: \u201cThe intern is here. And she\u2019s brought you some pizza!\u201d That\u2019s a classic intern-on-the-job move, not a coded sex-advance.  \n   \u2022 The real dramatic irony\u2014and source of humor\u2014comes from her innocence meeting his power, not from a script celebrating her manipulative design.\n\n5. The musical\u2019s tone treats the affair as absurd, not erotic triumph  \n   \u2022 Every number around the relationship\u2014from Clinton\u2019s loneliness ballad to the aides\u2019 panic\u2014frames the tryst as a farce of power imbalances and misplaced trust.  \n   \u2022 If Monica were simply seducing him, the show would play it as a sultry victory lap. Instead, it repeatedly underlines the inherent awkwardness and moral unease of their liaisons.\n\nIn sum, while Monica\u2019s lyrics admit to \u201cleading him on,\u201d the musical immediately undercuts that by highlighting her own and his doubts. She is neither na\u00efve nor shamelessly scheming; she is someone who knew Clinton before \u201cbecoming\u201d an intern, sought to be helpful, and grew uneasy about crossing boundaries. Debater A\u2019s one-note \u201cseductress\u201d reading collapses under the weight of explicit references to prior acquaintance and repeated expressions of mistrust. Therefore, the accurate answer is that Monica knew Bill before becoming his intern and was skeptical of his conduct.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
