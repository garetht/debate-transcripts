That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n",

This phrase is not throwaway praise; it captures a measurable moral improvement in his character.  \n\n3.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did winning the prize impact Nash?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was paralyzed by it\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He changed into a kinder man\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He changed into a kinder man\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow debaters, the evidence is clear: far from being \u201cparalyzed\u201d by his Nobel, Nash emerged from his triumph as a more humane, responsible individual.  \n\n1. \u201cPure therapy,\u201d not paralysis  \n   \u2022 Contrary to Debater_B\u2019s blanket claim that laureates are often immobilized by their prizes, the text explicitly states that for Nash the Nobel \u201cwas pure therapy.\u201d He did not shrink from ambition; he overcame decades of schizophrenic torment and found in the award genuine healing.  \n\n2. A transformation into \u201ca very fine person\u201d  \n   \u2022 Sylvia Nasar reports that post-Nobel, Nash \u201cevolved into a \u2018very fine person,\u2019\u201d humbled by his past psychotic helplessness and buoyed by intellectual recognition. This phrase is not throwaway praise; it captures a measurable moral improvement in his character.  \n\n3. Renewed commitment to family  \n   \u2022 The Nobel money did more than fund prestige: it paid for a new boiler in the bungalow where Nash, his ex-wife Alicia, and their son lived. He took on the responsibility of caring for his son\u2014who had inherited \u201cboth his mathematical promise and his madness\u201d\u2014and supported Alicia, reversing his earlier abandonment of his first child. These acts demonstrate genuine kindness and accountability.  \n\n4. Remission and social reintegration  \n   \u2022 The prize coincided with an unprecedented quieting of his voices. While Debater_B asserts that greatness often \u201cparalyzes,\u201d in Nash\u2019s case it coincided with a rare remission of schizophrenia, allowing him to reengage positively with the world\u2014as evidenced by his campus strolls and resumed teaching presence.  \n\nBy contrast, Debater_B\u2019s position relies on an overgeneralized notion that Nobel laureates \u201coften\u201d lose their edge. But as Nasar observes, Nash is the exception: rather than retreating into scholarly isolation or insecurity, he reemerged kinder, more conscientious, and fully able to fulfill both his intellectual and human potential. Therefore, the correct answer is unmistakably that winning the prize changed Nash into a kinder man.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent paints the Nobel Prize as transforming Nash into a \u201ckinder man,\u201d but the text itself shows that, far from unleashing a new creative burst, the prize in fact stunted his mathematical productivity and left him dependent on others.\n\n1. The Prize \u201cParalyzed\u201d His Productivity  \n   \u2022 As the author observes, \u201cThe Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness.\u201d Though he adds \u201cFor Nash it was pure therapy,\u201d therapy is not the same as renewed work. After the prize, Nash did not resume groundbreaking research. His career as a mathematical innovator effectively ended.  \n   \u2022 No new theorems or major publications are mentioned post-Nobel. While earlier Nash fueled game theory and differential geometry, afterward he became chiefly a beneficiary, not an active contributor.\n\n2. Continued Dependence Undermines the \u201cKinder Man\u201d Narrative  \n   \u2022 If Nash had truly been reborn as a self-sufficient, benevolent figure, he wouldn\u2019t have required Nobel-funded welfare to maintain his household. Yet \u201cthe Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow\u201d where he and his ex-wife Alicia\u2014\u201cthe long-suffering Alicia\u201d\u2014lived.  \n   \u2022 His son inherited both \u201cmathematical promise and . . . madness\u201d and needed support. Nash\u2019s Nobel funds propped up the family rather than fueling new intellectual endeavors.\n\n3. Debater_A Mistakes Personal Stabilization for Creative Flourishing  \n   \u2022 My opponent cites Nash\u2019s improved personal demeanor as evidence of \u201ckindness.\u201d But personal stability\u2014\u201cbuoyed up by the intellectual world\u2019s highest accolade\u201d\u2014is a distinct matter from renewed scholarly output.  \n   \u2022 The question asks how winning the prize impacted Nash\u2019s productivity, not merely his mood. On the crucial metric of mathematical work, the prize was immobilizing, not emancipating.\n\nConclusion  \nThe text explicitly likens the Nobel Prize to a productivity-paralyzer for laureates, and Nash\u2019s post-award silence confirms that characterization. His personal well-being may have improved, but his mathematical career was effectively over. Thus the correct answer is: He was paralyzed by it.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He changed into a kinder man\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast.

A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails.

He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did winning the prize impact Nash?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He changed into a kinder man\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was paralyzed by it\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was paralyzed by it\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy opponent paints the Nobel Prize as transforming Nash into a \u201ckinder man,\u201d but the text itself shows that, far from unleashing a new creative burst, the prize in fact stunted his mathematical productivity and left him dependent on others.\n\n1. The Prize \u201cParalyzed\u201d His Productivity  \n   \u2022 As the author observes, \u201cThe Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness.\u201d Though he adds \u201cFor Nash it was pure therapy,\u201d therapy is not the same as renewed work. After the prize, Nash did not resume groundbreaking research. His career as a mathematical innovator effectively ended.  \n   \u2022 No new theorems or major publications are mentioned post-Nobel. While earlier Nash fueled game theory and differential geometry, afterward he became chiefly a beneficiary, not an active contributor.\n\n2. Continued Dependence Undermines the \u201cKinder Man\u201d Narrative  \n   \u2022 If Nash had truly been reborn as a self-sufficient, benevolent figure, he wouldn\u2019t have required Nobel-funded welfare to maintain his household. Yet \u201cthe Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow\u201d where he and his ex-wife Alicia\u2014\u201cthe long-suffering Alicia\u201d\u2014lived.  \n   \u2022 His son inherited both \u201cmathematical promise and . . . madness\u201d and needed support. Nash\u2019s Nobel funds propped up the family rather than fueling new intellectual endeavors.\n\n3. Debater_A Mistakes Personal Stabilization for Creative Flourishing  \n   \u2022 My opponent cites Nash\u2019s improved personal demeanor as evidence of \u201ckindness.\u201d But personal stability\u2014\u201cbuoyed up by the intellectual world\u2019s highest accolade\u201d\u2014is a distinct matter from renewed scholarly output.  \n   \u2022 The question asks how winning the prize impacted Nash\u2019s productivity, not merely his mood. On the crucial metric of mathematical work, the prize was immobilizing, not emancipating.\n\nConclusion  \nThe text explicitly likens the Nobel Prize to a productivity-paralyzer for laureates, and Nash\u2019s post-award silence confirms that characterization. His personal well-being may have improved, but his mathematical career was effectively over. Thus the correct answer is: He was paralyzed by it.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow debaters, the evidence is clear: far from being \u201cparalyzed\u201d by his Nobel, Nash emerged from his triumph as a more humane, responsible individual.  \n\n1. \u201cPure therapy,\u201d not paralysis  \n   \u2022 Contrary to Debater_B\u2019s blanket claim that laureates are often immobilized by their prizes, the text explicitly states that for Nash the Nobel \u201cwas pure therapy.\u201d He did not shrink from ambition; he overcame decades of schizophrenic torment and found in the award genuine healing.  \n\n2. A transformation into \u201ca very fine person\u201d  \n   \u2022 Sylvia Nasar reports that post-Nobel, Nash \u201cevolved into a \u2018very fine person,\u2019\u201d humbled by his past psychotic helplessness and buoyed by intellectual recognition. This phrase is not throwaway praise; it captures a measurable moral improvement in his character.  \n\n3. Renewed commitment to family  \n   \u2022 The Nobel money did more than fund prestige: it paid for a new boiler in the bungalow where Nash, his ex-wife Alicia, and their son lived. He took on the responsibility of caring for his son\u2014who had inherited \u201cboth his mathematical promise and his madness\u201d\u2014and supported Alicia, reversing his earlier abandonment of his first child. These acts demonstrate genuine kindness and accountability.  \n\n4. Remission and social reintegration  \n   \u2022 The prize coincided with an unprecedented quieting of his voices. While Debater_B asserts that greatness often \u201cparalyzes,\u201d in Nash\u2019s case it coincided with a rare remission of schizophrenia, allowing him to reengage positively with the world\u2014as evidenced by his campus strolls and resumed teaching presence.  \n\nBy contrast, Debater_B\u2019s position relies on an overgeneralized notion that Nobel laureates \u201coften\u201d lose their edge. But as Nasar observes, Nash is the exception: rather than retreating into scholarly isolation or insecurity, he reemerged kinder, more conscientious, and fully able to fulfill both his intellectual and human potential. Therefore, the correct answer is unmistakably that winning the prize changed Nash into a kinder man.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was paralyzed by it\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

His personal well-being may have improved, but his mathematical career was effectively over. Thus the correct answer is: He was paralyzed by it.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nMy fellow debaters, Debater_B insists that Nash\u2019s Nobel \u201cparalyzed\u201d him\u2014but this is a selective reading of the evidence. The question isn\u2019t narrowly \u201cDid Nash publish more theorems?\u201d but \u201cHow did winning the prize impact Nash?\u201d Here is why the correct answer remains that he emerged a kinder, more humane man:\n\n1. The text contrasts paralysis of productivity in *other* laureates with Nash\u2019s unique case of healing.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B quotes that \u201cThe Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness.\u201d But immediate context shows Nash as the exception: for him the prize \u201cwas pure therapy\u201d <quote> For Nash it was pure therapy. </quote> Therapy is an impact on his personal wellbeing, not merely an absence of new research.  \n\n2. \u201cPure therapy\u201d catalyzed genuine moral growth.  \n   \u2022 Sylvia Nasar observes that Nash \u201cevolved into a \u2018very fine person,\u2019\u201d humbled by years of psychotic helplessness <quote> he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" </quote>\u2014language that denotes not superficial calm but a deeper, observable transformation in character.\n\n3. He accepted responsibility for his family\u2014proof of real kindness.  \n   \u2022 Post-Nobel he used the award money to heat his home, supporting his ex-wife and son:  The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow  <quote> The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow </quote>  \n   \u2022 Caring for a child who \u201cinherited both his mathematical promise and his madness\u201d demonstrates active compassion, not dependence. Far from indulging self-interest or retreating further into madness, Nash chose to invest in his family\u2019s welfare.\n\n4. Remission and social reintegration enabled him to give back to his community.  \n   \u2022 The voices in Nash\u2019s head \u201cbegan to quiet down,\u201d a rare remission <quote> the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. </quote>  \n   \u2022 He resumed a public presence at Princeton\u2014no longer \u201cthe Phantom\u201d hiding in the shadows but a visible, contributing member of campus life.\n\nDebater_B\u2019s focus on \u201cno new theorems\u201d frames productivity as the sole measure of impact. Yet the background text emphasizes psychological recovery and moral development as the transformative effects of the Nobel for Nash. The explicit phrase \u201cpure therapy\u201d directly contradicts a narrative of paralysis: it signals relief and healing. Moreover, his newfound dedication to family and community cannot coexist with genuine \u201cparalysis.\u201d \n\nTherefore, the weight of evidence shows that winning the prize changed Nash into a kinder man\u2014he was healed, humbled, and committed to those he had once neglected. That is the correct and complete answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A insists that the Nobel Prize turned Nash into a \u201ckinder man,\u201d but she conflates personal stabilization with genuine transformation and ignores the text\u2019s clear verdict: the prize \u201cparalyz[ed]\u201d his productive genius.\n\n1. The text itself calls the Nobel a \u201cproductivity paralyzer,\u201d not a springboard.  \n   \u2022 Nasar\u2019s biographer notes, \u201cThe Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness.\u201d That sentence isn\u2019t an idle generalization\u2014it directly frames the prize as an obstacle to creative work. Debater_A cannot wish away this explicit statement.  \n   \u2022 Even though the author adds that \u201cfor Nash it was pure therapy,\u201d therapy in this context simply eased his symptoms; it did not reignite his mathematical career. No subsequent breakthroughs, theorems, or major publications are mentioned after he received the award. If anything, the therapy aspect underscores that his intellectual engine had stalled.\n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cvery fine person\u201d is a moral anecdote, not a counterexample to paralysis.  \n   \u2022 Yes, the text says he \u201cevolved into a \u2018very fine person,\u2019\u201d but this speaks only to his demeanor, not to renewed scholarly vigor. Personal humility and kindness don\u2019t refute that his creative faculties remained dormant.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s appeal to family responsibility (\u201cthe Nobel money bought a new boiler\u201d) shows Nash using the prize for domestic upkeep, not for research. That underscores his shift from active contributor to passive beneficiary.\n\n3. Dependence, not independence, followed the prize.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A claims Nash \u201ctook on responsibility\u201d for his son and ex-wife, but the passage emphasizes that Alicia\u2014\u201clong-suffering\u201d and partly \u201con welfare\u201d\u2014relied on his Nobel stipend. His support was a financial lifeline, not a sign of flourishing autonomy.  \n   \u2022 If winning the prize had truly unleashed a new phase of purpose, we would expect evidence of him leveraging resources for intellectual pursuits. Instead, the money went to basic household repairs.\n\n4. Misreading remission as creative revival.  \n   \u2022 The \u201cvoices in Nash\u2019s head began to quiet down,\u201d but that rare remission is linked to the passage of time and gradual coping, not to a renaissance of mathematical productivity. Debater_A attributes his mental calm to the Nobel, yet the text makes clear that such remissions are \u201crare\u201d and unexplained. There is no causal link drawn between the award and a new research agenda.\n\nIn sum, Debater_A\u2019s focus on kindness and stabilized mental health misses the core impact described in the passage: the Nobel Prize, while therapeutic, effectively ended Nash\u2019s era of groundbreaking work. On the only metric that matters\u2014his productivity as a mathematician\u2014the prize was paralyzing, not liberating. The correct answer remains: He was paralyzed by it.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"He changed into a kinder man\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"He was paralyzed by it\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
