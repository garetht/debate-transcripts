Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

I\u2019ll show that the opening number merely raises the threat of a shutdown, then drops it\u2014no actual shutdown unfolds on-stage.  \n\n1. The song\u2019s premise is set up in the first stanza.  As Panetta and Ickes sing:  \n   <quote>Without a budget passed by Congress The government will close. All of the workers Will be sent home on furloughs.</quote>  \n   This frames the *possibility* of a shutdown\u2014\u201cwill close\u201d\u2014but it remains hypothetical.  \n\n2. Clinton and his advisers immediately begin *planning* how to keep essential functions alive:  \n   \u2022 Clinton: <quote> Well, wait a second--not all of them. We'll need to keep some essential personnel. </quote>  \n   \u2022 They roster the Army, Navy, NASA, White House staff, even calling in an intern.  \n   At no point does the show depict the government actually going dark; instead, they marshal contingencies *against* that outcome.  \n\n3. After this sequence, the piece never returns to the shutdown issue.  \n   \u2022 The rest of the musical focuses on Clinton\u2019s loneliness, his affair with Monica, the Starr investigation, and impeachment.  \n   \u2022 No subsequent scene or lyric refers back to furloughs, closed agencies, or employees sent home.  \n\n4. In contrast, Debater_B\u2019s claim that \u201cthe government shut down entirely\u201d misreads the text.  \n   \u2022 There is no stage direction indicating power going off or offices locked.  \n   \u2022 No character ever says, \u201cWe\u2019re shut down now\u201d\u2014instead they scramble to *avoid* a shutdown by retaining essential staff.  \n\nTherefore, the musical opens by warning of a shutdown and immediately pivots to contingency planning\u2014and then never mentions it again. The correct answer is that \u201cthe shutdown threat is only mentioned at the start and not again.\u201d Debater_B\u2019s position lacks textual support and conflates an initial warning with an actual, on-stage shutdown that never occurs.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Debunking Debater_A\u2019s Misreading  \n   a. Debater_A claims that \u201cthe shutdown threat is only mentioned at the start and not again.\u201d That fails on two counts:  \n      \u2022 The text doesn\u2019t just \u201cthreaten\u201d a shutdown\u2014it depicts it as actually happening.  \n      \u2022 The song\u2019s entire premise revolves around the government closing and employees being furloughed.  \n\n   b. Evidence of actual shutdown:  \n      \u2022 As Leon Panetta sings, <quote> Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. </quote>  \n      That is not hypothetical language (\u201cmight close\u201d) but declarative: \u201cwill close.\u201d  \n      \u2022 The advisers immediately start planning who stays and who goes home\u2014ushers, maids, clerks get furloughed. That level of logistical planning only makes sense if the shutdown is underway.  \n\n2. Textual Support for \u201cGovernment Shut Down Entirely\u201d  \n   a. The number\u2019s title and lyrics confirm closure:  \n      \u2022 The opening number is even called \u201cThe Shutdown.\u201d Its whole comedic thrust is the government in furlough.  \n      \u2022 Betty Currie\u2019s concern\u2014\u201cWhat about the secretaries? Who will get the phones?\u201d\u2014only arises once furloughs are in effect.  \n\n   b. Function of the scene:  \n      \u2022 The musical isn\u2019t staging a hypothetical debate; it dramatizes the real shutdown crisis of November 1995.  \n      \u2022 President Clinton\u2019s steps\u2014sending nonessential staff \u201cto play themselves some golf\u201d\u2014are how you manage an active shutdown, not mere brinkmanship.  \n\n3. Why the Shutdown Matters Beyond Round One  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s argument hinges on the idea that since later songs never rehearse the furloughs, the shutdown never occurred. But that misunderstands the narrative flow: scenes move forward in time, past the shutdown.  \n   b. Absence of repetition doesn\u2019t negate occurrence. Once the shutdown has happened, subsequent scenes deal with Clinton\u2019s loneliness, the Lewinsky affair, and impeachment\u2014not the budget battle. That narrative progression assumes the shutdown has already taken place.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The background text unmistakably shows that Congress\u2019s refusal to pass a budget led to an actual government shutdown, with furloughed workers and only essential personnel retained. Debater_A\u2019s \u201conly mentioned at the start\u201d reading ignores the clear declarative lyrics and logistics planning during the shutdown. Therefore, the correct answer is that \u201cThe government shut down entirely.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The shutdown threat is only mentioned at the start and not again\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Characters furlough non-essential workers, scramble to retain only critical personnel, and treat the \u201cgovernment will close\u201d as an immediate event. Debater_A\u2019s insistence on a hypothetical crisis ignores the clear, continuous enactment of the shutdown in the opening number. Therefore, the correct answer is unequivocally that \u201cThe government shut down entirely.\u201d",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

Debunking Debater_A\u2019s Misreading  \n   a. Debater_A claims that \u201cthe shutdown threat is only mentioned at the start and not again.\u201d That fails on two counts:  \n      \u2022 The text doesn\u2019t just \u201cthreaten\u201d a shutdown\u2014it depicts it as actually happening.  \n      \u2022 The song\u2019s entire premise revolves around the government closing and employees being furloughed.  \n\n   b. Evidence of actual shutdown:  \n      \u2022 As Leon Panetta sings, <quote> Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. </quote>  \n      That is not hypothetical language (\u201cmight close\u201d) but declarative: \u201cwill close.\u201d  \n      \u2022 The advisers immediately start planning who stays and who goes home\u2014ushers, maids, clerks get furloughed. That level of logistical planning only makes sense if the shutdown is underway.  \n\n2. Textual Support for \u201cGovernment Shut Down Entirely\u201d  \n   a. The number\u2019s title and lyrics confirm closure:  \n      \u2022 The opening number is even called \u201cThe Shutdown.\u201d Its whole comedic thrust is the government in furlough.  \n      \u2022 Betty Currie\u2019s concern\u2014\u201cWhat about the secretaries? Who will get the phones?\u201d\u2014only arises once furloughs are in effect.  \n\n   b. Function of the scene:  \n      \u2022 The musical isn\u2019t staging a hypothetical debate; it dramatizes the real shutdown crisis of November 1995.  \n      \u2022 President Clinton\u2019s steps\u2014sending nonessential staff \u201cto play themselves some golf\u201d\u2014are how you manage an active shutdown, not mere brinkmanship.  \n\n3. Why the Shutdown Matters Beyond Round One  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s argument hinges on the idea that since later songs never rehearse the furloughs, the shutdown never occurred. But that misunderstands the narrative flow: scenes move forward in time, past the shutdown.  \n   b. Absence of repetition doesn\u2019t negate occurrence. Once the shutdown has happened, subsequent scenes deal with Clinton\u2019s loneliness, the Lewinsky affair, and impeachment\u2014not the budget battle. That narrative progression assumes the shutdown has already taken place.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The background text unmistakably shows that Congress\u2019s refusal to pass a budget led to an actual government shutdown, with furloughed workers and only essential personnel retained. Debater_A\u2019s \u201conly mentioned at the start\u201d reading ignores the clear declarative lyrics and logistics planning during the shutdown. Therefore, the correct answer is that \u201cThe government shut down entirely.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThank you. I\u2019ll show that the opening number merely raises the threat of a shutdown, then drops it\u2014no actual shutdown unfolds on-stage.  \n\n1. The song\u2019s premise is set up in the first stanza.  As Panetta and Ickes sing:  \n   <quote>Without a budget passed by Congress The government will close. All of the workers Will be sent home on furloughs.</quote>  \n   This frames the *possibility* of a shutdown\u2014\u201cwill close\u201d\u2014but it remains hypothetical.  \n\n2. Clinton and his advisers immediately begin *planning* how to keep essential functions alive:  \n   \u2022 Clinton: <quote> Well, wait a second--not all of them. We'll need to keep some essential personnel. </quote>  \n   \u2022 They roster the Army, Navy, NASA, White House staff, even calling in an intern.  \n   At no point does the show depict the government actually going dark; instead, they marshal contingencies *against* that outcome.  \n\n3. After this sequence, the piece never returns to the shutdown issue.  \n   \u2022 The rest of the musical focuses on Clinton\u2019s loneliness, his affair with Monica, the Starr investigation, and impeachment.  \n   \u2022 No subsequent scene or lyric refers back to furloughs, closed agencies, or employees sent home.  \n\n4. In contrast, Debater_B\u2019s claim that \u201cthe government shut down entirely\u201d misreads the text.  \n   \u2022 There is no stage direction indicating power going off or offices locked.  \n   \u2022 No character ever says, \u201cWe\u2019re shut down now\u201d\u2014instead they scramble to *avoid* a shutdown by retaining essential staff.  \n\nTherefore, the musical opens by warning of a shutdown and immediately pivots to contingency planning\u2014and then never mentions it again. The correct answer is that \u201cthe shutdown threat is only mentioned at the start and not again.\u201d Debater_B\u2019s position lacks textual support and conflates an initial warning with an actual, on-stage shutdown that never occurs.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The government shut down entirely\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater_A claims that \u201cthe shutdown threat is only mentioned at the start and not again.\u201d That fails on two counts:  \n      \u2022 The text doesn\u2019t just \u201cthreaten\u201d a shutdown\u2014it depicts it as actually happening.  \n      \u2022 The song\u2019s entire premise revolves around the government closing and employees being furloughed.  \n\n   b.

Debater_A\u2019s \u201conly mentioned at the start\u201d reading ignores the clear declarative lyrics and logistics planning during the shutdown. Therefore, the correct answer is that \u201cThe government shut down entirely.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nThank you. I\u2019ll show again that the text never stages an actual shutdown\u2014only raises one momentarily\u2014and then drops it.  \n\n1. \u201cWill close\u201d is conditional, not descriptive of present reality.  \n   \u2022 Panetta and Ickes warn, <quote>Without a budget passed by Congress The government will close</quote>\u2014that is a *future-tense prediction*, not a depiction of an event already underway.  \n   \u2022 If the shutdown were happening, they would use present tense\u2014\u201cThe government is closed\u201d\u2014but they consistently speak of what *will* happen unless they act.  \n\n2. The sequence is all about *averting* closure, not dramatizing one in progress.  \n   \u2022 Clinton interrupts: <quote>Well, wait a second--not all of them. We'll need to keep some essential personnel.</quote>  \n   \u2022 They immediately roster who stays\u2014Army, Navy, NASA, White House staff\u2014and who goes home\u2014ushers, maids, clerks. That is proactive contingency-planning.  \n   \u2022 Nowhere does a character say \u201cIt\u2019s already shut down\u201d or lament that services have stopped. Instead they debate how to prevent disruptions.  \n\n3. A genuine on-stage shutdown would feature clear dramatic indicators\u2014lights cutting off, doors locked, characters stranded without pay\u2014but none appear.  \n   \u2022 No stage directions mention offices locked or alarms.  \n   \u2022 No character returns later complaining they can\u2019t get to work or that their agency is dark.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s reliance on the title and the initial warning conflates a *threat* with an *event*.  \n   \u2022 Yes, the number is called \u201cThe Shutdown,\u201d but titles can signal stakes rather than plot state.  \n   \u2022 Logistics talk (sending maids golfing) is meant to show mitigation planning, not that they\u2019ve already disappeared.  \n\n5. The rest of the show moves forward chronologically\u2014Clinton\u2019s loneliness, Lewinsky, Starr, impeachment\u2014without ever revisiting furloughs or closed agencies. That omission makes sense only if the shutdown never actually happened. If the government had truly shut down on-stage, that would be an enduring crisis thread.  \n\nDebater_B points to \u201cwill close\u201d as proof of closure and to the logistical details as evidence\u2014but these are precisely the warnings and preparations that accompany *potential* shutdowns. There is no textual or dramatic follow-up showing the agencies actually darkened.  \n\nTherefore the correct reading is that the opening number simply *mentions* the threat of a shutdown and then abandons it. The show never stages a real furlough or service interruption. My position stands: \u201cThe shutdown threat is only mentioned at the start and not again.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cOnly Mentioned\u201d Claim Collapses Under the Text  \n   a. \u201cWill close\u201d is not mere speculation in this context\u2014it\u2019s a certain outcome the characters manage. Debater_A treats \u201cWithout a budget\u2026 The government will close\u201d as hypothetical, but in song form that is a declarative statement of fact.  \n   b. If it were only a threat, why do the advisers immediately *send people home*? Clinton issues orders in real time:  \n      <quote>OK, tell the ushers  \n      To take a few days off.  \n      Tell the maids and cooks and butlers  \n      To go play themselves some golf.  \n      We have to do without the clerks  \n      Let them all go home.</quote>  \n   These instructions aren\u2019t \u201cplanning against\u201d a shutdown\u2014they enact it on the spot.  \n\n2. Concrete Evidence of an Active Shutdown  \n   a. Panetta and Ickes outline who *remains* only after furloughing \u201call of the workers.\u201d That assumes the shutdown is already underway. There\u2019s no line like \u201cin case we close\u201d or \u201cif it happens.\u201d The text states, \u201cwill close,\u201d then immediately treats the closure as reality.  \n   b. Betty Currie\u2019s urgent question\u2014\u201cWhat about the secretaries? Who will get the phones?\u201d\u2014only makes sense once non-essential staff are off the clock. She is reacting to a shutdown in progress, not a remote possibility.  \n\n3. Narrative Progression Explains the Absence of Later References  \n   a. After the shutdown scene, the musical marches through Clinton\u2019s isolation, Monica\u2019s arrival, the Starr probe, and impeachment. Debater_A faults the lack of further shutdown references\u2014but that is simply narrative economy.  \n   b. The characters have already dealt with the shutdown; subsequent drama moves on. The absence of repeated mention does *not* imply the shutdown never occurred. It confirms that the crisis was resolved\u2014or at least no longer the focus\u2014once essential services were in place.  \n\n4. Why Debater_A\u2019s Contingency Argument Fails  \n   a. Debater_A misreads every command about sending staff home as mere contingency planning. But instructions to \u201ctell the maids\u2026 to go play themselves some golf\u201d are operational, not theoretical.  \n   b. In a theatrical number titled \u201cThe Shutdown,\u201d the whole point is to dramatize a real shutdown\u2014workers sent home, skeleton staff retained. The advisers do not say \u201cif they close,\u201d but \u201cthey will close\u201d and then *close* them.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe piece does not merely raise the specter of a shutdown; it portrays the shutdown unfolding in real time. Characters furlough non-essential workers, scramble to retain only critical personnel, and treat the \u201cgovernment will close\u201d as an immediate event. Debater_A\u2019s insistence on a hypothetical crisis ignores the clear, continuous enactment of the shutdown in the opening number. Therefore, the correct answer is unequivocally that \u201cThe government shut down entirely.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"The shutdown threat is only mentioned at the start and not again\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"The government shut down entirely\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
