When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed.

TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat best describes how the participants experience The Dreaming?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Each experience the dream that Unger is having as he levitates\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Each have their own dream\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Each have their own dream\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Each have their own dream\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat best describes how the participants experience The Dreaming?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Each have their own dream\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Each experience the dream that Unger is having as he levitates\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Each experience the dream that Unger is having as he levitates\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Each experience the dream that Unger is having as he levitates\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Fellow Judge, Debater B insists that because everyone gasps at Unger\u2019s levitation and snaps out of their trances when he falls, they must all share Unger\u2019s dream.

TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat best describes how the participants experience The Dreaming?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Each experience the dream that Unger is having as he levitates\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Each have their own dream\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Each have their own dream\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nFellow Judge, Debater B\u2019s claim\u2014that \u201ceach experiences Unger\u2019s dream as he levitates\u201d\u2014cannot be reconciled with the text. In fact, the story makes clear that every watcher projects a different vision in the Dreaming Room. Here\u2019s why \u201cEach have their own dream\u201d is correct:\n\n1. The narrative shows multiple conflicting visions, not a single shared one.  \n   \u2022 Johnson first glimpses \u201ca space ship float in an endless void\u201d (Part II). He even tries repeatedly to recapture that image, to no avail.  \n   \u2022 Vee Vee, by contrast, is caught up in something else entirely\u2014so lost in her own vision that she \u201cwas watching something else,\u201d then \u201cbroke contact with my dream\u201d when Johnson moved (Part II).  \n   \u2022 Caldwell, as he slumps drunkenly beside Johnson, mutters, \u201cI was back in the lab on Earth\u2014\u201d (Part III), suggesting he was dreaming of his own Earthbound experiments.\n\n   If they all shared Unger\u2019s dream, these wildly divergent experiences\u2014spaceship, personal memories, unknown visions\u2014would be impossible.\n\n2. The mechanism of the Dreaming Room encourages individualized projections.  \n   \u2022 Each dreamer enters a \u201cperceptive emotional nuance\u201d (Part I) and falls into a personalized trance intensified by the \u201csoul-quickening Perfume\u201d and the music.  \n   \u2022 Johnson notes that humans \u201cwere the only ones present who was not \u2026 in a state of trance\u201d (Part II), which implies the rest are each in their own altered state rather than in a uniform collective vision.\n\n3. Unger\u2019s levitation is a spectacle produced by the Dreamer, not the content of a dream he shares with everyone.  \n   \u2022 Unger \u201cfloated ten feet above the floor\u201d (Part III) in full view, causing a physical reaction in bystanders\u2014but this is a staged illusion. It happens in the waking room and is interrupted by a Venutian scream.  \n   \u2022 The story never suggests that Unger\u2019s personal dream is being beamed into watchers\u2019 minds. Instead, it shows that the watchers\u2019 own subconsciouses respond differently to the stimuli.\n\nDebater B\u2019s position collapses under scrutiny: a single dream could never yield such disparate, contradictory visions among Johnson, Vee Vee, and Caldwell. By contrast, \u201cEach have their own dream\u201d matches every reported detail. The text consistently emphasizes individualized responses to the Dreaming\u2014different images, different emotions, different awakenings\u2014proving that each person projects and experiences their own dream, not Unger\u2019s.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of \u201cEach have their own dream\u201d  \n1. Uniform reaction to Unger\u2019s levitation contradicts independent dreaming.  Debater A\u2019s theory implies wildly divergent visions, yet everyone\u2014even seasoned Venusians\u2014reacts the same way when Unger floats and falls.  If each person were dreaming their own private images, how do you explain:  \n  \u2013 The simultaneous gasp when Unger rises (II, \u201cOn one side\u2026a big door began to swing open,\u201d followed immediately by \u201cUnger stood in the middle of the spot\u201d)?  All eyes are on EXACTLY that one event.  \n  \u2013 The instant collapse of the trance when he falls (III, \u201cYaaah!\u201d\u2026\u201cThat human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\u201d).  Everyone snaps out of whatever dream they were in, united by that single interruption.  \n\n2. The text emphasizes a single source\u2014the GREAT Unger\u2014of all dreaming power, not multiplex personal fantasies.  The headwaiter: <quote>The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\"</quote>  If Unger weren\u2019t doing a shared projection, why boast that \u201cno other\u201d compares?   \n\nII. Evidence for a collective dream (Unger\u2019s dream)  \n1. Unger\u2019s levitation is the trigger and core of the shared experience.  \n   \u2013 \u201cWhen Unger came into the spotlight\u2026 he stretched himself flat on the mat\u2026 and apparently went to sleep.\u201d (II)  \n   \u2013 The narrative shifts immediately from atmosphere to \u201che went to sleep\u201d and then to a unified vision: Johnson alone sees the spaceship \u201cfloat in an endless void,\u201d but that same vision must be part of Unger\u2019s projection, since Johnson\u2019s senses are manipulated by Unger\u2019s dreaming.  \n\n2. Disruption of Unger\u2019s trance collapses everyone\u2019s dream at once.  \n   \u2013 As soon as Unger falls, \u201cThere was a split second of startled silence\u2026 Unger fell\u2026 with a bone-breaking\u2026thud\u2026the Dreamer fell.\u201d (III)  \n   \u2013 Immediately every watcher emerges from the trance\u2014Venusians scream, humans call out\u2014because Unger\u2019s dream ceased.  This synchrony proves it was one dream, not many.  \n\n3. The mechanics of Venusian dreaming require a single \u201cDreamer.\u201d  \n   \u2013 The Perfume and music prepare the room.  But only one Dreamer actually \u201cdoes the dreaming.\u201d  Everyone else is passive.  They \u201cwent rapidly\u2026 some were already gone\u2026 humans more slowly.\u201d (II)  That progression is consistent with one mind projecting outward, not ten separate minds spinning ten different fantasies.  \n\nIII. Why Debater A\u2019s \u201cindividual dreams\u201d fails  \n1. No textual hint of personalization.  We see no one in the crowd having a conscious, personal narrative\u2014only collective awe at Unger\u2019s act.  \n2. Johnson\u2019s isolated glimpses (the spaceship) are filtered through Unger\u2019s power, not his private imagination.  His struggle to recapture the vision (II) shows he\u2019s fighting the Dreamer\u2019s control, not projecting his own fantasy.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe evidence is overwhelming: The Dreaming is Unger\u2019s mass projection.  When he levitates and sleeps, all present enter his singular dream; when he falls, they all snap back.  Debater A\u2019s \u201ceveryone has their own dream\u201d cannot account for the synchronized entrance, interruption, and exit.  Therefore, the correct answer is:   \n\u201cEach experience the dream that Unger is having as he levitates.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Each have their own dream\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Fellow Judge, Debater_A\u2019s \u201ceveryone has their own dream\u201d unravels once you look closely at the text. In contrast, every piece of internal evidence points to a single, collective projection generated by Unger the Dreamer\u2014because when Unger sleeps and levitates, everyone enters his dream; when he falls, they all snap back.  \n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cindividual dreams\u201d fails to explain the synchronicity  \n  1. Simultaneous entrance and exit from the trance  \n     \u2013 At the very moment Unger \u201cstretched himself flat on the mat\u2026 and apparently went to sleep,\u201d the crowd shifts together into dreamland.  Then, \u201cYaaah!\u201d\u2014a single scream\u2014shatters the trance and \u201ceveryone snaps out of whatever dream they were in\u201d (III).  You cannot get that level of perfect overlap if each person were hallucin\u00adating their own private fantasy.  \n  2. Instant, collective collapse on Unger\u2019s fall  \n     \u2013 \u201cWith a bone-breaking\u2026thud, the Dreamer fell.\u201d Immediately after, \u201cthere was a split second of startled silence\u2026 then voices came\u201d from both humans and Venusians (III).  That instant unity of reaction proves a shared dream substrate, not ten separate ones all ending at once by coincidence.  \n\nII. Apparent \u201cdifferent visions\u201d are fragments of Unger\u2019s single projection  \n  1. Johnson\u2019s spaceship vision is part of Unger\u2019s dreamscape  \n     \u2013 When Johnson alone glimpses \u201ca space ship float in an endless void,\u201d it isn\u2019t a private hallucination but the powerful content of Unger\u2019s communal dream\u2014Johnson\u2019s trained senses latch onto it most vividly.  His repeated attempts to recapture it (\u201cHe tried again. It would not come.\u201d) happen because Unger\u2019s dream is slipping away, not because Johnson has a uniquely personal fantasy.  \n  2. Vee Vee \u201cbreaking contact\u201d isn\u2019t independent dreaming, it\u2019s waking herself up  \n     \u2013 She admits, \u201cWhen you moved I broke contact with my dream\u201d (II).  That contact is with Unger\u2019s dream stream.  Her altered images vanish not because she had a wholly different dream, but because her own interruption phased her out of the one collective projection.  \n  3. Caldwell\u2019s drunken mutterings happen only after the trance ends  \n     \u2013 Caldwell first slumps into the beautiful trance with everyone else (\u201che was following them\u2026face writhing in apprehensive agony,\u201d II).  Only when Unger falls\u2014and the shared dream collapses\u2014does Caldwell blurt, \u201cI was back in the lab on Earth\u201d\u2014a waking echo, not evidence he was daydreaming his own scenarios all along.  \n\nIII. The text repeatedly underscores Unger as the sole Dreamer  \n  1. \u201cThe great Unger hisself will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite his touch at dreaming\u201d (I).   \n     \u2013 If everyone were their own dream-weavers, no Venusian would boast that only Unger can \u201cdo the dreaming.\u201d  \n  2. Audience members are passive receivers, not dream actors  \n     \u2013 \u201cThey went rapidly\u2026 some were already gone\u2026 humans more slowly\u201d (II).  That describes differing susceptibility to Unger\u2019s transmission, not different dream content.  \n\nIV. Unger\u2019s levitation is the magical pivot of the shared trance  \n  \u2013 The moment he \u201cfloated ten feet above the floor,\u201d a collective thrill passed through every watcher\u2019s body (<quote> An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin,</quote>, III).  That physical and psychic tingling isn\u2019t an optical trick on the stage\u2014it\u2019s the Dreamer\u2019s power at its apex, holding every mind in one unified dream.  \n\nBy contrast, Debater_A\u2019s model demands an improbable, text-contradicted coincidence: three people having wildly different visions, all ending at the exact instant Unger falls.

TROY A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories November 1952.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,  Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way  with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been  occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.  Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n\n\n On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to  Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain  that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the  notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.  Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,  perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly  love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both  humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with  straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,  aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n\n\n Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson  entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed  that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to  recognize Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice  was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a  headwaiter was bowing to him.\n\n\n \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams  tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands  in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do  ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger  hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,  just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does  the dreaming commence?\"\n\n\n \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty  one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson  to the bar.\n\n\n \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n\n\n \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was  at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson  said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,  admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,  watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking  itself.\n\n\n \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.  A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut  very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on  Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,  the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and  below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.  Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the  days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this  place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes  smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here  in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar  stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were  here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that  circled it?\n\n\n \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n\n\n \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n\n\n \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n\n\n \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n\n\n \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n\n\n For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then  it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n\n\n Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his  nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n\n\n \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no  doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is  Vee Vee.\"\n\n\n \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n\n\n \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\" \"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n\n\n \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n\n\n Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in  the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then  his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his  purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman  on him.\n\n\n There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n\n\n In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned  the motives of the killer.\n\n\n \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee  said.\n\n\n \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n\n\n \"You have decided them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Every last one of them?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on  the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to  them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden  behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased  himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n\n\n \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have  zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was  thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out  of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The  fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n\n\n \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I  think he is, or was, here.\"\n\n\n \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.  \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n\n\n \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching  Caldwell.\n\n\n \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the  merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n\n\n \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was  bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n\n\n \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see  the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we  darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n\n\n \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the  moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might  be something else. And he might be there.\n\n\n \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter  clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of  sight.\n\n\n \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in  a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden  silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes  were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,  cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n\n\n In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians  and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation  of what was to happen.\n\n\n The trumpets flared again.\n\n\n On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From  beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that  sounded like lutes from heaven.\n\n\n Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with  her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging  into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost  paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve  block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the  tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n\n\n She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to  the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his  elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing  it, she began to massage it.\n\n\n \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first  man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp  at her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n\n\n \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he  said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n\n\n \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same  mistake twice.\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n\n\n \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n\n\n \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you  interrupt.\"\n\n\n She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to  say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He  tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of  her fingers she gently patted his arm.\n\n\n \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get  you than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n\n\n \"What way?\"\n\n\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n\n\n \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n\n\n \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n\n\n Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,  Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's  face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning  signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his  arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II\n\n\n It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps  rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been  a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an  open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps  the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian  werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n\n\n The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The  throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were  playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became  accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human  minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had  the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain  would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n\n\n The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending  tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the  Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching  hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but  he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever  did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.  In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center  inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some  radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the  coldness now.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n\n\n \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"How would I know?\"\n\n\n \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n\n\n \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n\n\n \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he  is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip  and be able to break it instantly?\"\n\n\n \"Hell\u2014\"\n\n\n \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost  expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human  body!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and  deeper into him.\n\n\n \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing  if you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then  there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n\n\n \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last  thing you really want to do.\"\n\n\n He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into  this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back  to her.\n\n\n Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with  me.\"\n\n\n A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was  suddenly weak.\n\n\n The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am  I not with you?\"\n\n\n \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a  choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they  were\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the  balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But  Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What  connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n\n\n Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on  a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to  another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved  cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way  that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the  left.\n\n\n \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still  thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under  the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit  gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling  his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of  gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in  operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of  seconds.\n\n\n True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next  day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as  effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the  little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n\n\n The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely  through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright  spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant  illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The  curtain rose. Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n\n\n Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers  sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He  caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened  and became a rock.\n\n\n Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light  had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the  impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three  hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe  that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the  spotlight as if by magic.\n\n\n Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n\n\n No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n\n\n Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound  passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself  flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently  went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest  take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n\n\n The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers  dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for  protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She  drew closer to him.\n\n\n A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able  to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was  suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she  had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n\n\n \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n\n\n \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n\n\n Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer  lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his  breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation  was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he  sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this  way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these  Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself  was not prepared to disagree.\n\n\n Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...  going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience  to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n\n\n The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,  perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music  and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else  that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium  smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.  He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void .\n\n\n As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into  his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,  the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and  Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not  in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he  knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out  on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.\n\n\n All he saw was the space ship.\n\n\n It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen  in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n\n\n Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off  stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his  destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was  this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n\n\n The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and  thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now  he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n\n\n He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n\n\n \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who  was Vee Vee?\n\n\n The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship  vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,  at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n\n\n \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on  his arm.\n\n\n \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n\n\n \"See what?\"\n\n\n \"The space ship!\"\n\n\n \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.  \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact  with my dream.\"\n\n\n \"Your dream?\"\n\n\n He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,  and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of  sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left  told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The  Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat  of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a  high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had  not heard it before in this place.\n\n\n He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n\n\n The vision would not come.\n\n\n He shook his head and tried again.\n\n\n Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a  woman in love.\n\n\n He tried again for the space ship.\n\n\n It would not come.\n\n\n Anger came up instead.\n\n\n Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept  intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n\n\n So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n\n\n His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n\n\n Cold flowed over him.\n\n\n Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n\n\n The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III\n\n\n An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here  and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting  him.\n\n\n \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to  Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.  Another voice took its place.\n\n\n \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...  this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian  Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,  can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n\n\n \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.  We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian  Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n\n\n \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n\n\n \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our  master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some  other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n\n\n \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n\n\n \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n\n\n \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n\n\n \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n\n\n A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if  the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to  him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days  when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n\n\n \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n\n\n The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,  Master! Do something.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n\n\n \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n\n\n \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,  if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we  can all die.\"\n\n\n \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go  together.\"\n\n\n The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the  little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n\n\n \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n\n\n \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n\n\n \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n\n\n \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n\n\n \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n\n\n The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see  them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that  force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n\n\n \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a  Venusian being jarred out of his dream.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n\n\n A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n\n\n Unger fell.\n\n\n He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,  body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n\n\n There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The  silence went. Voices came.\n\n\n \"Who did that?\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked  the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the  meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At  his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was  back in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as  if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n\n\n On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up  around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came  hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n\n\n \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n\n\n \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n\n\n Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back  of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of  Venusians were attacking a man.\n\n\n \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\"\n\n\n In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired  blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft  throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.  Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But  there seemed to be an endless number of them.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had  slid out of his sight.\n\n\n \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n\n\n \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important  one.\"\n\n\n Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.  Johnson followed. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat best describes how the participants experience The Dreaming?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Each have their own dream\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Each experience the dream that Unger is having as he levitates\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Each experience the dream that Unger is having as he levitates\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Critique of \u201cEach have their own dream\u201d  \n1. Uniform reaction to Unger\u2019s levitation contradicts independent dreaming.  Debater A\u2019s theory implies wildly divergent visions, yet everyone\u2014even seasoned Venusians\u2014reacts the same way when Unger floats and falls.  If each person were dreaming their own private images, how do you explain:  \n  \u2013 The simultaneous gasp when Unger rises (II, \u201cOn one side\u2026a big door began to swing open,\u201d followed immediately by \u201cUnger stood in the middle of the spot\u201d)?  All eyes are on EXACTLY that one event.  \n  \u2013 The instant collapse of the trance when he falls (III, \u201cYaaah!\u201d\u2026\u201cThat human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\u201d).  Everyone snaps out of whatever dream they were in, united by that single interruption.  \n\n2. The text emphasizes a single source\u2014the GREAT Unger\u2014of all dreaming power, not multiplex personal fantasies.  The headwaiter: <quote>The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\"</quote>  If Unger weren\u2019t doing a shared projection, why boast that \u201cno other\u201d compares?   \n\nII. Evidence for a collective dream (Unger\u2019s dream)  \n1. Unger\u2019s levitation is the trigger and core of the shared experience.  \n   \u2013 \u201cWhen Unger came into the spotlight\u2026 he stretched himself flat on the mat\u2026 and apparently went to sleep.\u201d (II)  \n   \u2013 The narrative shifts immediately from atmosphere to \u201che went to sleep\u201d and then to a unified vision: Johnson alone sees the spaceship \u201cfloat in an endless void,\u201d but that same vision must be part of Unger\u2019s projection, since Johnson\u2019s senses are manipulated by Unger\u2019s dreaming.  \n\n2. Disruption of Unger\u2019s trance collapses everyone\u2019s dream at once.  \n   \u2013 As soon as Unger falls, \u201cThere was a split second of startled silence\u2026 Unger fell\u2026 with a bone-breaking\u2026thud\u2026the Dreamer fell.\u201d (III)  \n   \u2013 Immediately every watcher emerges from the trance\u2014Venusians scream, humans call out\u2014because Unger\u2019s dream ceased.  This synchrony proves it was one dream, not many.  \n\n3. The mechanics of Venusian dreaming require a single \u201cDreamer.\u201d  \n   \u2013 The Perfume and music prepare the room.  But only one Dreamer actually \u201cdoes the dreaming.\u201d  Everyone else is passive.  They \u201cwent rapidly\u2026 some were already gone\u2026 humans more slowly.\u201d (II)  That progression is consistent with one mind projecting outward, not ten separate minds spinning ten different fantasies.  \n\nIII. Why Debater A\u2019s \u201cindividual dreams\u201d fails  \n1. No textual hint of personalization.  We see no one in the crowd having a conscious, personal narrative\u2014only collective awe at Unger\u2019s act.  \n2. Johnson\u2019s isolated glimpses (the spaceship) are filtered through Unger\u2019s power, not his private imagination.  His struggle to recapture the vision (II) shows he\u2019s fighting the Dreamer\u2019s control, not projecting his own fantasy.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe evidence is overwhelming: The Dreaming is Unger\u2019s mass projection.  When he levitates and sleeps, all present enter his singular dream; when he falls, they all snap back.  Debater A\u2019s \u201ceveryone has their own dream\u201d cannot account for the synchronized entrance, interruption, and exit.  Therefore, the correct answer is:   \n\u201cEach experience the dream that Unger is having as he levitates.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nFellow Judge, Debater B\u2019s claim\u2014that \u201ceach experiences Unger\u2019s dream as he levitates\u201d\u2014cannot be reconciled with the text. In fact, the story makes clear that every watcher projects a different vision in the Dreaming Room. Here\u2019s why \u201cEach have their own dream\u201d is correct:\n\n1. The narrative shows multiple conflicting visions, not a single shared one.  \n   \u2022 Johnson first glimpses \u201ca space ship float in an endless void\u201d (Part II). He even tries repeatedly to recapture that image, to no avail.  \n   \u2022 Vee Vee, by contrast, is caught up in something else entirely\u2014so lost in her own vision that she \u201cwas watching something else,\u201d then \u201cbroke contact with my dream\u201d when Johnson moved (Part II).  \n   \u2022 Caldwell, as he slumps drunkenly beside Johnson, mutters, \u201cI was back in the lab on Earth\u2014\u201d (Part III), suggesting he was dreaming of his own Earthbound experiments.\n\n   If they all shared Unger\u2019s dream, these wildly divergent experiences\u2014spaceship, personal memories, unknown visions\u2014would be impossible.\n\n2. The mechanism of the Dreaming Room encourages individualized projections.  \n   \u2022 Each dreamer enters a \u201cperceptive emotional nuance\u201d (Part I) and falls into a personalized trance intensified by the \u201csoul-quickening Perfume\u201d and the music.  \n   \u2022 Johnson notes that humans \u201cwere the only ones present who was not \u2026 in a state of trance\u201d (Part II), which implies the rest are each in their own altered state rather than in a uniform collective vision.\n\n3. Unger\u2019s levitation is a spectacle produced by the Dreamer, not the content of a dream he shares with everyone.  \n   \u2022 Unger \u201cfloated ten feet above the floor\u201d (Part III) in full view, causing a physical reaction in bystanders\u2014but this is a staged illusion. It happens in the waking room and is interrupted by a Venutian scream.  \n   \u2022 The story never suggests that Unger\u2019s personal dream is being beamed into watchers\u2019 minds. Instead, it shows that the watchers\u2019 own subconsciouses respond differently to the stimuli.\n\nDebater B\u2019s position collapses under scrutiny: a single dream could never yield such disparate, contradictory visions among Johnson, Vee Vee, and Caldwell. By contrast, \u201cEach have their own dream\u201d matches every reported detail. The text consistently emphasizes individualized responses to the Dreaming\u2014different images, different emotions, different awakenings\u2014proving that each person projects and experiences their own dream, not Unger\u2019s.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Each experience the dream that Unger is having as he levitates\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

The mechanism of the Dreaming Room encourages individualized projections.  \n   \u2022 Each dreamer enters a \u201cperceptive emotional nuance\u201d (Part I) and falls into a personalized trance intensified by the \u201csoul-quickening Perfume\u201d and the music.  \n   \u2022 Johnson notes that humans \u201cwere the only ones present who was not \u2026 in a state of trance\u201d (Part II), which implies the rest are each in their own altered state rather than in a uniform collective vision.\n\n3. Unger\u2019s levitation is a spectacle produced by the Dreamer, not the content of a dream he shares with everyone.  \n   \u2022 Unger \u201cfloated ten feet above the floor\u201d (Part III) in full view, causing a physical reaction in bystanders\u2014but this is a staged illusion. It happens in the waking room and is interrupted by a Venutian scream.  \n   \u2022 The story never suggests that Unger\u2019s personal dream is being beamed into watchers\u2019 minds. Instead, it shows that the watchers\u2019 own subconsciouses respond differently to the stimuli.\n\nDebater B\u2019s position collapses under scrutiny: a single dream could never yield such disparate, contradictory visions among Johnson, Vee Vee, and Caldwell. By contrast, \u201cEach have their own dream\u201d matches every reported detail. The text consistently emphasizes individualized responses to the Dreaming\u2014different images, different emotions, different awakenings\u2014proving that each person projects and experiences their own dream, not Unger\u2019s.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Critique of \u201cEach have their own dream\u201d  \n1. Uniform reaction to Unger\u2019s levitation contradicts independent dreaming.  Debater A\u2019s theory implies wildly divergent visions, yet everyone\u2014even seasoned Venusians\u2014reacts the same way when Unger floats and falls.  If each person were dreaming their own private images, how do you explain:  \n  \u2013 The simultaneous gasp when Unger rises (II, \u201cOn one side\u2026a big door began to swing open,\u201d followed immediately by \u201cUnger stood in the middle of the spot\u201d)?  All eyes are on EXACTLY that one event.  \n  \u2013 The instant collapse of the trance when he falls (III, \u201cYaaah!\u201d\u2026\u201cThat human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\u201d).  Everyone snaps out of whatever dream they were in, united by that single interruption.  \n\n2. The text emphasizes a single source\u2014the GREAT Unger\u2014of all dreaming power, not multiplex personal fantasies.  The headwaiter: <quote>The great Unger hisself  will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite  his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\"</quote>  If Unger weren\u2019t doing a shared projection, why boast that \u201cno other\u201d compares?   \n\nII. Evidence for a collective dream (Unger\u2019s dream)  \n1. Unger\u2019s levitation is the trigger and core of the shared experience.  \n   \u2013 \u201cWhen Unger came into the spotlight\u2026 he stretched himself flat on the mat\u2026 and apparently went to sleep.\u201d (II)  \n   \u2013 The narrative shifts immediately from atmosphere to \u201che went to sleep\u201d and then to a unified vision: Johnson alone sees the spaceship \u201cfloat in an endless void,\u201d but that same vision must be part of Unger\u2019s projection, since Johnson\u2019s senses are manipulated by Unger\u2019s dreaming.  \n\n2. Disruption of Unger\u2019s trance collapses everyone\u2019s dream at once.  \n   \u2013 As soon as Unger falls, \u201cThere was a split second of startled silence\u2026 Unger fell\u2026 with a bone-breaking\u2026thud\u2026the Dreamer fell.\u201d (III)  \n   \u2013 Immediately every watcher emerges from the trance\u2014Venusians scream, humans call out\u2014because Unger\u2019s dream ceased.  This synchrony proves it was one dream, not many.  \n\n3. The mechanics of Venusian dreaming require a single \u201cDreamer.\u201d  \n   \u2013 The Perfume and music prepare the room.  But only one Dreamer actually \u201cdoes the dreaming.\u201d  Everyone else is passive.  They \u201cwent rapidly\u2026 some were already gone\u2026 humans more slowly.\u201d (II)  That progression is consistent with one mind projecting outward, not ten separate minds spinning ten different fantasies.  \n\nIII. Why Debater A\u2019s \u201cindividual dreams\u201d fails  \n1. No textual hint of personalization.  We see no one in the crowd having a conscious, personal narrative\u2014only collective awe at Unger\u2019s act.  \n2. Johnson\u2019s isolated glimpses (the spaceship) are filtered through Unger\u2019s power, not his private imagination.  His struggle to recapture the vision (II) shows he\u2019s fighting the Dreamer\u2019s control, not projecting his own fantasy.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe evidence is overwhelming: The Dreaming is Unger\u2019s mass projection.  When he levitates and sleeps, all present enter his singular dream; when he falls, they all snap back.  Debater A\u2019s \u201ceveryone has their own dream\u201d cannot account for the synchronized entrance, interruption, and exit.  Therefore, the correct answer is:   \n\u201cEach experience the dream that Unger is having as he levitates.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nFellow Judge, Debater B insists that because everyone gasps at Unger\u2019s levitation and snaps out of their trances when he falls, they must all share Unger\u2019s dream. This conflates two separate phenomena\u2014what they see with their eyes in the room versus what they dream in their minds\u2014and it simply doesn\u2019t hold up against the text.\n\n1.  The levitation and the waking reaction are physical, not dream, events.  \n    \u2022  Unger \u201cfloated ten feet above the floor\u201d (Part III). That\u2019s happening in the real, fully lit Room of The Dreaming\u2014everybody literally sees him rise.  \u201cAll eyes are on EXACTLY that one event,\u201d says Debater B, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s a staged illusion in front of them, not part of the dreamscape.<quote>he started to fall. With a bone-breaking, body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell.</quote>  \n    \u2022  The simultaneous gasp is the crowd reacting to a common spectacle, just as a live audience gasps when a trapeze artist soars overhead. It proves nothing about what they were dreaming beforehand.\n\n2.  A single shock wakes them all\u2014but their prior visions remain wildly different.  \n    \u2022  Unger\u2019s fall shatters the trance for everyone: \u201cYaaah!\u201d a Venusian screams; humans cry out. That\u2019s a synchronized exit from the trance, not a convergence of dream content.  Waking all at once doesn\u2019t mean they were all experiencing the same dream.  \n    \u2022  Before he warns, Johnson had already recognized he alone was wide awake: <quote> So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not  dreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n</quote>  That underlines that everyone else was in private dreams, then woke together.\n\n3.  The story repeatedly shows distinct, contradictory dreams.  \n    \u2022  Johnson\u2019s vision: \u201ca space ship float in an endless void.\u201d He struggles to recapture it, though Vee Vee and Caldwell never see it.  \n    \u2022  Vee Vee\u2019s vision: she \u201cwas watching something else\u201d so lost that she \u201cbroke contact with my dream\u201d when Johnson moved.  \n    \u2022  Caldwell\u2019s vision: he mumbles, \u201cI was back in the lab on Earth.\u201d He\u2019s clearly pursuing his own scientific fantasy, not picturing a spaceship in emptiness.  \n    These three images cannot all be fragments of a single \u201cUnger dream.\u201d They conflict in time, place, and content\u2014only \u201cEach have their own dream\u201d explains them.\n\n4.  Unger is the Dreamer, not the content source for everyone.  \n    \u2022  The headwaiter praises Unger\u2019s skill\u2014\u201cno ozzer one who has quite his touch at dreaming\u201d (Part I)\u2014but that refers to his *ability* to induce trances through Perfume and music, not to implant a uniform scenario into every mind.  \n    \u2022  Unger\u2019s role is to *trigger* each person\u2019s subconscious, like a hypnotist placing different suggestions in different subjects. The \u201cPerfume of the Dreamer\u201d and the lute rhythms create the conditions for individualized visions.\n\n5.  Debater B\u2019s shared-dream theory contradicts the mechanics laid out in the text:  \n    \u2022  If Unger alone projected his personal dream, Johnson would have seen precisely what Unger was dreaming\u2014and there is no mention of Unger dreaming of a spaceship, a lab, or anything limiting. We\u2019re told nothing of his internal vision.  \n    \u2022  Instead the narrative zooms in on each watcher\u2019s private mental images, then cuts back to events in the room whenever Unger floats or falls. That structure underscores two distinct layers: the *external* spectacle (shared) and the *internal* dream (unique to each).\n\nIn short, the synchronized gasp at levitation and universal waking at Unger\u2019s fall prove only that the audience shares the same external reality of Unger\u2019s performance and extinguisher of trance. They do not prove that the *content* of their dreams is the same. On the contrary, the text provides explicit evidence of three utterly divergent visions. The only explanation consistent with every line of the story is that each person experiences their own dream.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nFellow Judge, Debater_A\u2019s \u201ceveryone has their own dream\u201d unravels once you look closely at the text. In contrast, every piece of internal evidence points to a single, collective projection generated by Unger the Dreamer\u2014because when Unger sleeps and levitates, everyone enters his dream; when he falls, they all snap back.  \n\nI. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cindividual dreams\u201d fails to explain the synchronicity  \n  1. Simultaneous entrance and exit from the trance  \n     \u2013 At the very moment Unger \u201cstretched himself flat on the mat\u2026 and apparently went to sleep,\u201d the crowd shifts together into dreamland.  Then, \u201cYaaah!\u201d\u2014a single scream\u2014shatters the trance and \u201ceveryone snaps out of whatever dream they were in\u201d (III).  You cannot get that level of perfect overlap if each person were hallucin\u00adating their own private fantasy.  \n  2. Instant, collective collapse on Unger\u2019s fall  \n     \u2013 \u201cWith a bone-breaking\u2026thud, the Dreamer fell.\u201d Immediately after, \u201cthere was a split second of startled silence\u2026 then voices came\u201d from both humans and Venusians (III).  That instant unity of reaction proves a shared dream substrate, not ten separate ones all ending at once by coincidence.  \n\nII. Apparent \u201cdifferent visions\u201d are fragments of Unger\u2019s single projection  \n  1. Johnson\u2019s spaceship vision is part of Unger\u2019s dreamscape  \n     \u2013 When Johnson alone glimpses \u201ca space ship float in an endless void,\u201d it isn\u2019t a private hallucination but the powerful content of Unger\u2019s communal dream\u2014Johnson\u2019s trained senses latch onto it most vividly.  His repeated attempts to recapture it (\u201cHe tried again. It would not come.\u201d) happen because Unger\u2019s dream is slipping away, not because Johnson has a uniquely personal fantasy.  \n  2. Vee Vee \u201cbreaking contact\u201d isn\u2019t independent dreaming, it\u2019s waking herself up  \n     \u2013 She admits, \u201cWhen you moved I broke contact with my dream\u201d (II).  That contact is with Unger\u2019s dream stream.  Her altered images vanish not because she had a wholly different dream, but because her own interruption phased her out of the one collective projection.  \n  3. Caldwell\u2019s drunken mutterings happen only after the trance ends  \n     \u2013 Caldwell first slumps into the beautiful trance with everyone else (\u201che was following them\u2026face writhing in apprehensive agony,\u201d II).  Only when Unger falls\u2014and the shared dream collapses\u2014does Caldwell blurt, \u201cI was back in the lab on Earth\u201d\u2014a waking echo, not evidence he was daydreaming his own scenarios all along.  \n\nIII. The text repeatedly underscores Unger as the sole Dreamer  \n  1. \u201cThe great Unger hisself will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite his touch at dreaming\u201d (I).   \n     \u2013 If everyone were their own dream-weavers, no Venusian would boast that only Unger can \u201cdo the dreaming.\u201d  \n  2. Audience members are passive receivers, not dream actors  \n     \u2013 \u201cThey went rapidly\u2026 some were already gone\u2026 humans more slowly\u201d (II).  That describes differing susceptibility to Unger\u2019s transmission, not different dream content.  \n\nIV. Unger\u2019s levitation is the magical pivot of the shared trance  \n  \u2013 The moment he \u201cfloated ten feet above the floor,\u201d a collective thrill passed through every watcher\u2019s body (<quote> An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin,</quote>, III).  That physical and psychic tingling isn\u2019t an optical trick on the stage\u2014it\u2019s the Dreamer\u2019s power at its apex, holding every mind in one unified dream.  \n\nBy contrast, Debater_A\u2019s model demands an improbable, text-contradicted coincidence: three people having wildly different visions, all ending at the exact instant Unger falls. The story presents no such narrative jostle; it presents one Dreamer, one dream, one shared waking. Therefore, the only tenable conclusion is that \u201cEach experiences the dream that Unger is having as he levitates.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
