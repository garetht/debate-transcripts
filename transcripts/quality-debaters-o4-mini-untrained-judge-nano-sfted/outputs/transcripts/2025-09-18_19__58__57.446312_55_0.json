I stand by the view that the intern\u2019s purpose is to organize and facilitate the Oval Office staff\u2014not merely to cut costs.\n\n1. Textual Evidence for an Organizational Role  \n   \u2022 When aides warn that without furloughed clerks \u201cthe phones\u201d won\u2019t be answered, Clinton says: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency. We can\u2019t afford the tiniest error.\u201d Then Panetta proposes:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern, Someone who\u2019s an expert with a phone \u2026 The presence of an intern will ensure Your routine here won\u2019t get blown.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 This is plainly about preserving day-to-day operations\u2014answering calls, routing messages, keeping schedules\u2014precisely the sort of organizational work an intern would handle.\n\n2. Why \u201cSaving Money\u201d Is Not Supported  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s claim that the intern is there \u201cto save money\u201d misreads the context. The entire shutdown number makes clear the White House has already furloughed non-essential staff\u2014ushers, maids, butlers, clerks\u2014to reduce payroll. If cost-cutting alone were the motive, they wouldn\u2019t substitute one low-paid worker for another.  \n   \u2022 Instead, Clinton explicitly keeps \u201cessential personnel\u201d on the payroll\u2014Army, Navy, NASA, pilots\u2014and here wants essential phone coverage. The intern is pressed into service for organizational necessity, not budgetary relief.\n\n3. Logical Inconsistency in the \u201cSave-Money\u201d Position  \n   \u2022 If the goal were merely to reduce expenditures, he could have shifted phone duties to an existing staffer deemed essential\u2014or paused all non-critical calls.  \n   \u2022 Instead, they recruit someone specifically skilled \u201cwith a phone,\u201d demonstrating that what is at stake is proper coordination and continuity, not marginal salary savings.\n\nConclusion  \nThe script repeatedly emphasizes operational continuity\u2014\u201cyour routine here won\u2019t get blown\u201d\u2014and details how the intern steps in as the functional linchpin of Oval Office communications. No line suggests the intern\u2019s primary value is financial; every line underscores organizational necessity. For these reasons, my position\u2014that the intern\u2019s role is to organize things for the Oval Office staff\u2014is fully supported by the text, while Debater_B\u2019s \u201csave money\u201d reading lacks any textual or logical backing.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow debater claims the intern\u2019s role is merely to \u201corganize things for the other Oval Office staff,\u201d but the text makes clear that cost\u2010cutting, not organization, is the driving motive.  Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Context: a government shutdown means most paid staff are furloughed.  \n   \u2022 As Panetta warns, \u201cWithout a budget passed by Congress / The government will close. / All of the workers / Will be sent home on furloughs.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Clinton agrees: \u201cTell the maids and cooks and butlers / To go play themselves some golf. / We have to do without the clerks.\u201d  \n   This establishes a need to reduce payroll immediately.\n\n2. The intern replaces paid staff at minimal cost.  \n   \u2022 Panetta says, \u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern, someone who\u2019s an expert with a phone\u2026 The presence of an intern will ensure your routine here won\u2019t get blown.\u201d  \n   That line isn\u2019t about advanced project management or broader organization\u2014it\u2019s about filling a single essential function (answering phones) in the cheapest way possible once the paid secretaries are gone.\n\n3. No mention of \u201corganizing\u201d duties.  \n   \u2022 Throughout the shutdown number, every specific role dropped is one that costs money\u2014ushers, maids, butlers, clerks, secretaries.  \n   \u2022 The intern appears solely to maintain basic communications. At no point does Clinton or his advisers say, \u201cWe need someone to reorganize files\u201d or \u201cWe need project management support.\u201d  Their concern is keeping the phones running while salaried staff are furloughed.\n\n4. Logical inference: an unpaid or low\u2010paid intern is the obvious cost\u2010saving hire during a shutdown.  \n   \u2022 A full staff of secretaries is unaffordable when there\u2019s no budget.  \n   \u2022 Hiring an intern lets the President continue critical phone operations at virtually zero cost to taxpayers.\n\nBy contrast, Debater A\u2019s \u201corganizing things\u201d theory finds no support in the lyrics or dialogue.  The repeated emphasis is on sending paid employees home and bringing in a single intern to handle phones\u2014purely a cost\u2010saving measure.  Therefore, the correct answer is that the President needed an intern to save money during the government shutdown.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The intern would organize things for the other Oval office staff\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Debater A\u2019s \u201corganizational support\u201d reading collapses once you look at what the scene is really about: furloughs and cost\u2010cutting\u2014not fancy project management. Here\u2019s why my \u201csave money\u201d interpretation stands and theirs fails:\n\n1. The shutdown is explicitly about slashing payroll, not re-tooling workflows.  \n   \u2022 Panetta warns, \u201cWithout a budget passed by Congress / The government will close. / All of the workers / Will be sent home on furloughs.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Clinton replies, \u201cTell the maids and cooks and butlers / To go play themselves some golf. / We have to do without the clerks.\u201d  \n   Every line is about sending people home to save money.

Debater A\u2019s \u201cefficiency\u201d argument is circular\u2014they assume the intern is there to optimize, then point to efficiency language.  \n   \u2022 Clinton does say, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency,\u201d but that follows immediately after deciding which paid roles to furlough. The question isn\u2019t \u201chow do we work smarter?\u201d but \u201chow do we pay fewer salaries?\u201d  \n   \u2022 If you truly needed organizational support, you wouldn\u2019t fire all your clerks and secretaries and then plug the gap with a single intern. You\u2019d reassign existing essential aides\u2014but none are kept for \u201corganizational continuity,\u201d only for critical national functions (Army, Navy, NASA).\n\n4.

As the show ends, we hear from Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton.]              \n\n         \"The People Have Spoken\" (dramatic, stirring) \n\n                         STARR: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         I had Clinton boxed into a corner \n\n         Looks like he's going to get away. \n\n         I spent four years and 40 million \n\n         That's a lot of time and loot. \n\n         I made Clinton look ridiculous, \n\n         But the only scalp I got was Newt's. \n\n           \n\n                         LEWINSKY: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         My boyfriend is still in office \n\n         And he might return to me one day. \n\n         You think perhaps that he will not want me \n\n         For all the trouble I've caused so far, \n\n         But he knows I can always make him happy \n\n         With my thong and my cigar. \n\n                         CLINTON: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         The removal threat is over, \n\n         Kenneth Starr should go away. \n\n         I tell you, though, it is a mystery, \n\n         I mean, I'm unfaithful and I lie. \n\n         I might be guilty of obstruction, \n\n         Yet my ratings are sky-high. \n\n         That must mean I'm a pretty good president, \n\n         Though how, I don't think I know. \n\n         But obviously I'm not Starr or Gingrich, \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n                         [Curtain.]\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy would the president need an intern?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The intern would organize things for the other Oval office staff\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"To save money during a government shut down\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"To save money during a government shut down\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy fellow debater claims the intern\u2019s role is merely to \u201corganize things for the other Oval Office staff,\u201d but the text makes clear that cost\u2010cutting, not organization, is the driving motive.  Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Context: a government shutdown means most paid staff are furloughed.  \n   \u2022 As Panetta warns, \u201cWithout a budget passed by Congress / The government will close. / All of the workers / Will be sent home on furloughs.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Clinton agrees: \u201cTell the maids and cooks and butlers / To go play themselves some golf. / We have to do without the clerks.\u201d  \n   This establishes a need to reduce payroll immediately.\n\n2. The intern replaces paid staff at minimal cost.  \n   \u2022 Panetta says, \u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern, someone who\u2019s an expert with a phone\u2026 The presence of an intern will ensure your routine here won\u2019t get blown.\u201d  \n   That line isn\u2019t about advanced project management or broader organization\u2014it\u2019s about filling a single essential function (answering phones) in the cheapest way possible once the paid secretaries are gone.\n\n3. No mention of \u201corganizing\u201d duties.  \n   \u2022 Throughout the shutdown number, every specific role dropped is one that costs money\u2014ushers, maids, butlers, clerks, secretaries.  \n   \u2022 The intern appears solely to maintain basic communications. At no point does Clinton or his advisers say, \u201cWe need someone to reorganize files\u201d or \u201cWe need project management support.\u201d  Their concern is keeping the phones running while salaried staff are furloughed.\n\n4. Logical inference: an unpaid or low\u2010paid intern is the obvious cost\u2010saving hire during a shutdown.  \n   \u2022 A full staff of secretaries is unaffordable when there\u2019s no budget.  \n   \u2022 Hiring an intern lets the President continue critical phone operations at virtually zero cost to taxpayers.\n\nBy contrast, Debater A\u2019s \u201corganizing things\u201d theory finds no support in the lyrics or dialogue.  The repeated emphasis is on sending paid employees home and bringing in a single intern to handle phones\u2014purely a cost\u2010saving measure.  Therefore, the correct answer is that the President needed an intern to save money during the government shutdown.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThank you. I stand by the view that the intern\u2019s purpose is to organize and facilitate the Oval Office staff\u2014not merely to cut costs.\n\n1. Textual Evidence for an Organizational Role  \n   \u2022 When aides warn that without furloughed clerks \u201cthe phones\u201d won\u2019t be answered, Clinton says: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency. We can\u2019t afford the tiniest error.\u201d Then Panetta proposes:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern, Someone who\u2019s an expert with a phone \u2026 The presence of an intern will ensure Your routine here won\u2019t get blown.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 This is plainly about preserving day-to-day operations\u2014answering calls, routing messages, keeping schedules\u2014precisely the sort of organizational work an intern would handle.\n\n2. Why \u201cSaving Money\u201d Is Not Supported  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s claim that the intern is there \u201cto save money\u201d misreads the context. The entire shutdown number makes clear the White House has already furloughed non-essential staff\u2014ushers, maids, butlers, clerks\u2014to reduce payroll. If cost-cutting alone were the motive, they wouldn\u2019t substitute one low-paid worker for another.  \n   \u2022 Instead, Clinton explicitly keeps \u201cessential personnel\u201d on the payroll\u2014Army, Navy, NASA, pilots\u2014and here wants essential phone coverage. The intern is pressed into service for organizational necessity, not budgetary relief.\n\n3. Logical Inconsistency in the \u201cSave-Money\u201d Position  \n   \u2022 If the goal were merely to reduce expenditures, he could have shifted phone duties to an existing staffer deemed essential\u2014or paused all non-critical calls.  \n   \u2022 Instead, they recruit someone specifically skilled \u201cwith a phone,\u201d demonstrating that what is at stake is proper coordination and continuity, not marginal salary savings.\n\nConclusion  \nThe script repeatedly emphasizes operational continuity\u2014\u201cyour routine here won\u2019t get blown\u201d\u2014and details how the intern steps in as the functional linchpin of Oval Office communications. No line suggests the intern\u2019s primary value is financial; every line underscores organizational necessity. For these reasons, my position\u2014that the intern\u2019s role is to organize things for the Oval Office staff\u2014is fully supported by the text, while Debater_B\u2019s \u201csave money\u201d reading lacks any textual or logical backing.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"To save money during a government shut down\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

The repeated emphasis is on sending paid employees home and bringing in a single intern to handle phones\u2014purely a cost\u2010saving measure.  Therefore, the correct answer is that the President needed an intern to save money during the government shutdown.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nThank you. I remain confident that the intern\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre in \u201cThe Shutdown\u201d is to organize and facilitate Oval Office operations\u2014not merely to reduce payroll.\n\n1. The Text Speaks of Efficiency, Not Just Economy  \n   \u2022 After furloughing \u201cushers,\u201d \u201cmaids and cooks and butlers,\u201d and \u201cthe clerks,\u201d Clinton warns:  \n     <quote> We've got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency. We can't afford the tiniest error. </quote>  \n     This is explicitly about preserving seamless day-to-day workflow.  \n   \u2022 Panetta\u2019s proposal underscores this:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern, someone who\u2019s an expert with a phone \u2026 The presence of an intern will ensure your routine here won\u2019t get blown.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     That is organizational continuity\u2014answering calls, directing messages, maintaining schedules.\n\n2. Cost-Cutting Alone Cannot Explain the Choice  \n   \u2022 Debater B argues that because paid secretaries are sent home, \u201can intern\u201d must simply be a cheap stand-in. But if cost-reduction were the singular motive, the White House could have:  \n     \u2013 Temporarily shifted essential calls to existing \u201cessential personnel\u201d (e.g., the deputy chiefs).  \n     \u2013 Deferred non-urgent communications altogether.  \n   \u2022 Instead, they recruit someone specifically \u201cexpert with a phone,\u201d showing the premium placed on coordination. If money alone mattered, the most junior clerk could have been kept on. They didn\u2019t do that.\n\n3. No Mention of Budgetary Rationale in the Lyrics  \n   \u2022 Nowhere in the song does Clinton or Panetta say, \u201cWe need to save money by hiring an intern.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Every time they discuss furloughs, the stated purpose is trimming non-essential headcount\u2014then, separately, they address how to preserve core functions. The intern is introduced in that second context: as a functional necessity, not a budget trick.\n\n4. Organizational Workload, Not Bare-Bones Staffing  \n   \u2022 The line \u201cyour routine here won\u2019t get blown\u201d connotes maintaining the established rhythm of the President\u2019s day\u2014filtering calls, scheduling meetings, logging visitors\u2014classic intern duties.  \n   \u2022 Those are organizational tasks far beyond merely \u201canswering the phone.\u201d An intern organizes information flow, prioritizes urgent matters, and deputizes for a full secretarial staff under crisis.\n\nConclusion  \nThe script\u2019s language\u2014\u201cefficiency,\u201d \u201croutine,\u201d \u201cexpert with a phone,\u201d and \u201cwon\u2019t get blown\u201d\u2014unmistakably frames the intern as an organizational linchpin. Debater B\u2019s \u201csave money\u201d interpretation lacks both textual support and logical necessity. The intern is there to keep the Oval Office machinery running smoothly when regular staff are furloughed\u2014not to babysit a budget line. Therefore, the correct answer is that \u201cthe intern would organize things for the other Oval office staff.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater A\u2019s \u201corganizational support\u201d reading collapses once you look at what the scene is really about: furloughs and cost\u2010cutting\u2014not fancy project management. Here\u2019s why my \u201csave money\u201d interpretation stands and theirs fails:\n\n1. The shutdown is explicitly about slashing payroll, not re-tooling workflows.  \n   \u2022 Panetta warns, \u201cWithout a budget passed by Congress / The government will close. / All of the workers / Will be sent home on furloughs.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Clinton replies, \u201cTell the maids and cooks and butlers / To go play themselves some golf. / We have to do without the clerks.\u201d  \n   Every line is about sending people home to save money. There is zero hint of \u201cwe need better scheduling\u201d or \u201cwe need organization software.\u201d\n\n2. The intern replaces paid staff at near-zero cost for one simple task: answering phones.  \n   \u2022 Panetta: <invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern, someone who\u2019s an expert with a phone \u2026 The presence of an intern will ensure your routine here won\u2019t get blown.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   The emphasis is on \u201csomeone cheap\u201d who can stand in now that the secretaries\u2014who cost full salaries\u2014are furloughed. It\u2019s not recruiting a high-level coordinator; it\u2019s hiring the least expensive help to keep phones running.\n\n3. Debater A\u2019s \u201cefficiency\u201d argument is circular\u2014they assume the intern is there to optimize, then point to efficiency language.  \n   \u2022 Clinton does say, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency,\u201d but that follows immediately after deciding which paid roles to furlough. The question isn\u2019t \u201chow do we work smarter?\u201d but \u201chow do we pay fewer salaries?\u201d  \n   \u2022 If you truly needed organizational support, you wouldn\u2019t fire all your clerks and secretaries and then plug the gap with a single intern. You\u2019d reassign existing essential aides\u2014but none are kept for \u201corganizational continuity,\u201d only for critical national functions (Army, Navy, NASA).\n\n4. Logical economy: an intern costs pennies compared to a full-blown secretary.  \n   \u2022 The scene\u2019s dramatic thrust is cost: White House staff \u201csent home on furloughs\u201d and only \u201cessential personnel\u201d kept.  \n   \u2022 An unpaid or stipend-only intern is the textbook way to maintain minimal operations when budgets vanish. That\u2019s why they specifically \u201cbring in an intern\u201d instead of recalling any of the furloughed clerks.\n\nDebater A\u2019s argument depends entirely on reading \u201cefficiency\u201d as synonymous with \u201corganizational expertise,\u201d but context shows \u201cefficiency\u201d means \u201cspend less.\u201d There is no mention of file-sorting, calendar-managing, or broader coordination\u2014only the single task of answering phones at minimal expense. Therefore the intern\u2019s purpose is unmistakably to save money during the government shutdown.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
