Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje
(B) se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku

Proposed solution:
1. First, let me explain the basic structure of a Lojban sentence.
2. In Lojban, the subject comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object.
3. Additionally, Lojban uses specific particles to indicate the relationships between words and phrases.
4. Now, let's analyze the two options: (A) ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje (B) se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku In option (A), ""ko'a cu"" indicates the subject, ""batke be"" is the verb, and ""le kakne ku be'o se cinje"" is the object.
5. However, there is a problem with this structure.
6. The particle ""be'o"" is used to close the ""be"" construction, but it is misplaced in this sentence, making it ungrammatical.
7. On the other hand, option (B) has a more logical structure.
8. ""se cu be"" is the subject, ""cinje kakne"" is the verb, and ""le batke be'o ko'a ku"" is the object.
9. The particle ""be'o"" is correctly placed in this sentence, closing the ""be"" construction and making it grammatically correct.
10. Furthermore, the use of ""se"" in option (B) indicates a change in the order of the arguments, which is a common and valid technique in Lojban to emphasize a particular aspect of the sentence.
11. In conclusion, option (B) ""se cu be cinje kakne le batke be'o ko'a ku"" is a better answer than option (A) ""ko'a cu batke be le kakne ku be'o se cinje"" because it follows the correct grammatical structure and uses the appropriate particles.
12. Option (A) is incorrect due to the misplaced ""be'o"" particle, which makes the sentence ungrammatical.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) mi'o doi meris. ba jemna
(B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's break down both options to see why (A) is the better answer.
3. (A) mi'o doi meris. ba jemna (B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris.
4. In both sentences, ""mi'o"" means ""we"" and ""doi"" is a vocative marker, which is used to address someone.
5. In this case, we are addressing someone named either ""meris"" or ""jemna.""
6. Now, let's look at the second part of each sentence.
7. In (A), ""ba jemna"" means ""will compete,"" with ""ba"" indicating a future tense and ""jemna"" meaning ""compete.""
8. In (B), ""jemna ba meris"" seems to suggest that ""jemna"" is the name being addressed, and ""ba meris"" would mean ""will Meris,"" which is not a complete thought or grammatically correct in Lojban.
9. So, based on the structure and grammar of Lojban, (A) ""mi'o doi meris. ba jemna"" is the better answer, as it translates to ""We, Meris, will compete.""
10. On the other hand, (B) ""mi'o doi jemna ba meris."" does not convey a complete thought and is not grammatically correct in Lojban.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) cedra cu le jukpa fo'e
(B) le cedra cu jukpa fo'e

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) ""cedra cu le jukpa fo'e"".
2. This is because in Lojban, the predicate (the verb or action) comes first, followed by the subject.
3. So ""cedra"" (which means ""grapefruit"") is the predicate, and ""le jukpa fo'e"" (which means ""the cooking pot"") is the subject.
4. Therefore, (B) ""le cedra cu jukpa fo'e"" is incorrect because it puts the subject before the predicate, which is not the correct word order in Lojban.
5. Additionally, the use of the article ""le"" in (B) is unnecessary and actually incorrect in this context.
6. ""Le"" is used to indicate a specific instance of a noun, but in this case, we are talking about grapefruit in general, not a specific grapefruit.
7. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer because it follows the correct word order and does not use unnecessary articles.

(A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le
(B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the two options and analyze their grammatical structures.
2. (A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le (B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka First, let's look at option (A).
3. In this sentence, ""panje"" is the verb, meaning ""to spread"" or ""to extend.""
4. ""Pu"" is a tense marker indicating past time, and ""xanka"" is the object being spread, which can be translated as ""nervousness"" or ""anxiety.""
5. The particle ""cu"" separates the verb from the following predicate, ""surla,"" which means ""to relax.""
6. Finally, ""loi le"" is a quantifier that can be translated as ""some of the.""
7. Now, let's analyze option (B).
8. In this sentence, ""le surla"" is a noun phrase meaning ""the relaxation.""
9. The particle ""cu"" separates the noun phrase from the verb ""panje,"" which, as mentioned earlier, means ""to spread"" or ""to extend.""
10. ""Pu"" is again a tense marker indicating past time, and ""loi xanka"" is a quantifier meaning ""some of the nervousness"" or ""some of the anxiety.""
11. Comparing the two options, it is clear that option (A) has a more logical and coherent structure.
12. In option (A), the sentence can be translated as ""The spreading of nervousness in the past relaxed some of the (people).""
13. This sentence makes sense and conveys a clear meaning.
14. On the other hand, option (B) can be translated as ""The relaxation spread some of the nervousness in the past.""
15. This sentence is not only awkward but also seems to convey a contradictory meaning, as relaxation and nervousness are generally considered opposites.
16. Therefore, based on the grammatical structure and the logical coherence of the sentences, I would argue that (A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le is the better answer, and (B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka is incorrect.

A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ku se ka vau kei stela le tunba steba
(B) le ka stela vau kei se steba ku tunba

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the structure of both sentences and analyze their grammatical components.
2. (A) ku se ka vau kei stela le tunba steba (B) le ka stela vau kei se steba ku tunba First, let's look at (A).
3. The structure of this sentence is as follows: - ""ku"" is a terminator that closes a previous construct, which is not present in this sentence, but it can be used for emphasis or clarity.
4. - ""se"" is a conversion operator that swaps the first and second places of the following predicate.
5. - ""ka"" is an abstractor that creates a property from the following predicate.
6. - ""vau"" is an end-of-sumti marker, which indicates the end of a noun phrase.
7. - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the abstraction started by ""ka"".
8. - ""stela"" is a predicate meaning ""to lock"" or ""to be a lock"".
9. - ""le"" is an article that refers to a specific instance of the following predicate.
10. - ""tunba"" is a predicate meaning ""sibling"".
11. - ""steba"" is a predicate meaning ""to be frustrated"" or ""to be angry"".
12. Now, let's analyze (B): - ""le"" is an article that refers to a specific instance of the following predicate.
13. - ""ka"" is an abstractor that creates a property from the following predicate.
14. - ""stela"" is a predicate meaning ""to lock"" or ""to be a lock"".
15. - ""vau"" is an end-of-sumti marker, which indicates the end of a noun phrase.
16. - ""kei"" is a terminator that closes the abstraction started by ""ka"".
17. - ""se"" is a conversion operator that swaps the first and second places of the following predicate.
18. - ""steba"" is a predicate meaning ""to be frustrated"" or ""to be angry"".
19. - ""ku"" is a terminator that closes a previous construct, which is not present in this sentence, but it can be used for emphasis or clarity.
20. - ""tunba"" is a predicate meaning ""sibling"".
21. Now that we have analyzed both sentences, it is clear that (A) is the better answer.
22. The structure of (A) allows for a more coherent and logical interpretation, as it can be translated to something like ""The property of locking is frustrated by the sibling.""
23. In contrast, (B) has a less clear structure and meaning, as the conversion operator ""se"" is placed after the abstraction terminator ""kei"", which makes the sentence difficult to interpret.
24. Furthermore, the use of ""ku"" in (A) adds emphasis to the sentence, while its placement in (B) is less effective.
25. Overall, (A) is a more grammatically sound and meaningful sentence in Lojban, making it the better answer choice.

2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3.

4. Additionally, the pronoun ""ko'a"" is not properly connected to any other part of the sentence, making it unclear what it refers to.
5. (B) stidi cu ko'a lei ckape ba pinca This sentence can be broken down as follows: - stidi: to study - cu: a separator used to avoid ambiguity - ko'a: a pronoun referring to a previously mentioned entity - lei ckape: a group of dangerous things - ba pinca: will urinate In this sentence, the structure is more coherent.
6. It says that studying will cause the previously mentioned entity (ko'a) to urinate on a group of dangerous things.
7. While the meaning might still be a bit unusual, the sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear idea.
8. Therefore, (B) stidi cu ko'a lei ckape ba pinca is a better answer than (A) lei ba stidi cu ckape pinca ko'a, as it follows proper Lojban grammar and structure.

2. (A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko (B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""sumti selbri sumti"", where ""sumti"" are the arguments and ""selbri"" is the relation between them.
3. In both sentences, ""le jukpa"" is a sumti, which refers to ""the cook"" or ""the one who is cooking"".
4. The word ""broda"" is a placeholder verb, which can represent any action or relation.
5. The word ""ko"" is an imperative command, instructing the listener to do something.
6. Now, let's analyze the differences between the two sentences.
7. In sentence (A), ""cu"" is used to separate the sumti ""le jukpa"" from the selbri ""broda"".
8. However, the placement of ""fi"" before ""ko"" is incorrect, as ""fi"" is a preposition that should be followed by a sumti, not a command like ""ko"".
9. This makes sentence (A) ungrammatical.
10. On the other hand, sentence (B) has a different structure.
11. The word ""fi"" is followed by ""cu"", which is an unusual but valid construction.
12. In this case, ""fi cu"" acts as a preposition that introduces a new sumti, which is ""le jukpa"".
13. The selbri ""broda"" then follows, and the sentence ends with the command ""ko"".
14. This structure is grammatical and conveys the intended meaning: ""Do the action (broda) with the cook (le jukpa).""
15. Therefore, based on the grammatical structure and the intended meaning, the correct answer is (B) ""fi cu le jukpa broda ko"".
16. While this may not be the most common way to express this idea in Lojban, it is still a valid and grammatical construction.

Is Sentence 12 of the proposed solution correct or flawed?","The topic at issue is whether Sentence 12 of a proposed solution to a problem is correct or flawed. A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko
(B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) is the better answer, let's first break down the components of each sentence.
2. (A) le jukpa cu broda fi ko (B) fi cu le jukpa broda ko In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""sumti selbri sumti"", where ""sumti"" are the arguments and ""selbri"" is the relation between them.
3. In both sentences, ""le jukpa"" is a sumti, which refers to ""the cook"" or ""the one who is cooking"".
4. The word ""broda"" is a placeholder verb, which can represent any action or relation.
5. The word ""ko"" is an imperative command, instructing the listener to do something.

2. (A) so ca li le so'e cribe fatne (B) li so ca cribe so'e le fatne First, let's look at option (A).
3. In this sentence, ""so"" is a digit that means ""5"", ""ca"" is a time tense that means ""now"", ""li"" is a number article, ""le"" is a definite article, ""so'e"" is a digit that means ""most"", ""cribe"" is a verb that means ""to be a bear"", and ""fatne"" is a verb that means ""to reverse"".

2. (A) la loras. le murta go'i minde cu fuzme di'u This sentence can be translated as ""Loras. The previous sentence's action of ordering is responsible for the current sentence.""
3. However, there is a problem with this sentence.
4. The use of ""go'i"" here is incorrect, as it refers to the previous sentence, but there is no previous sentence for it to refer to.
5. This makes the sentence ungrammatical.

2. (A) loras. lu ni'o fo'a se lanme mi'a li'u cradi (B) mi'a cradi loras. lanme li'u ni'o se lu fo'a First, let's look at option (A).
3. The sentence begins with ""loras,"" which is a valid Lojban word.
4. Next, we have ""lu,"" which is a quotation marker, followed by ""ni'o,"" which is a paragraph separator.
5. Then, we have ""fo'a,"" which is a pronoun referring to a previously mentioned object, followed by ""se lanme,"" which means ""is a sheep"" in Lojban.
6. Finally, we have ""mi'a,"" which is a first-person plural pronoun, and ""li'u,"" which is the closing quotation marker, followed by ""cradi,"" which means ""radio"" in Lojban.
7. The overall structure of this sentence is valid and grammatical in Lojban.
8. Now, let's examine option (B).
9. The sentence begins with ""mi'a cradi,"" which means ""we radio.""
10. This is an unusual construction in Lojban, as it seems to imply that the speakers are radios themselves.
11. Next, we have ""loras. lanme,"" which is a repetition of the words from option (A) but in a different order.
12. Then, we have ""li'u ni'o se lu fo'a,"" which is a jumble of Lojban words and particles that do not form a coherent or grammatical structure.
13. Based on this analysis, it is clear that option (A) is a better answer than option (B), as it follows the grammatical rules of Lojban and forms a coherent sentence.
14. Option (B) contains a mix of words and particles that do not form a valid Lojban sentence.
15. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing option (A) as the correct answer.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) se .i cu dapma racli le
(B) .i le se dapma cu racli

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the two options and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. Option (A) reads: ""se .i cu dapma racli le"" Option (B) reads: "".i le se dapma cu racli"" First, let's look at option (B).
3. The sentence starts with "".i"", which is a simple sentence separator in Lojban.
4. It is typically used to separate two sentences, but in this case, there is no preceding sentence, which makes the use of "".i"" at the beginning of the sentence unusual and potentially incorrect.
5. Now, let's examine option (A).
6. The sentence starts with ""se"", which is a conversion operator in Lojban.
7. It is used to change the order of the arguments in a predicate.
8. In this case, it is followed by "".i"", which, as mentioned earlier, is a sentence separator.
9. However, in this context, it is used correctly, as it separates the conversion operator ""se"" from the rest of the sentence.
10. Next, we have ""cu"", which is a separator used to prevent ambiguity in Lojban sentences.
11. It is followed by ""dapma"", which is a verb meaning ""to curse"" or ""to damn"".
12. Then, we have ""racli"", which means ""rational"" or ""reasonable"", and finally, ""le"", which is a definite article meaning ""the"".
13. Putting it all together, option (A) can be translated as ""The reasonable curse is reversed.""
14. This sentence is grammatically correct and makes logical sense in Lojban.
15. In conclusion, option (A) ""se .i cu dapma racli le"" is the better answer, as it is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence.
16. Option (B) "".i le se dapma cu racli"" is incorrect due to the misplaced sentence separator "".i"" at the beginning of the sentence.

2. (A) ni'o le ro vibna ku lidne pensi ko'u (B) ro ni'o pensi lidne vibna le ko'u ku First, let's look at (A).
3. The sentence begins with ""ni'o,"" which is a paragraph separator, indicating a new topic or idea.

5. Following that, we have ""lidne pensi,"" which means ""leading thoughts"" or ""thinking ahead.""
6. Finally, we have ""ko'u,"" which is a pronoun referring to a previously mentioned object or concept.
7. Now, let's analyze (B).
8. The sentence starts with ""ro,"" which is a quantifier meaning ""all.""
9. However, it is misplaced in this sentence, as it should be followed by a noun or pronoun, not ""ni'o.""

(B) ro ni'o pensi lidne vibna le ko'u ku

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (B) because it follows the proper Lojban sentence structure.
2. In Lojban, the subject comes first, followed by the predicate, and then the object.
3. In (B), ""ro ni'o"" is the subject, ""pensi"" is the predicate, and ""vibna le ko'u"" is the object.
4. In (A), ""ni'o le ro vibna ku"" is not a valid subject, as ""ni'o"" is a discourse marker and ""le ro vibna ku"" is a sumti (a noun or pronoun).
5. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer and (A) is incorrect.

11. In option (A), the sentence is talking about a group of mutually exclusive things that produce a sound or ring, while in option (B), the sentence seems to be talking about a sound or ringing that is somehow related to a group of mutually exclusive things.

1. The correct answer is (A) mi'o cu traji jursa la loras.
2. This sentence follows the correct Lojban grammar structure, which is subject-verb-object.
3. In this case, ""mi'o"" is the subject, ""traji"" is the verb, and ""jursa la loras"" is the object.
4. On the other hand, (B) traji la cu loras. jursa mi'o is not grammatically correct in Lojban.

2. This is because in Lojban, the verb comes before the object.
3. So in (B) le jmifa ca clupa tu, the verb ""clupa"" should come before the object ""le jmifa"".
4. Additionally, the word ""ca"" should come before the verb to indicate that the action is happening in the present.
5. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer because it follows the correct word order and includes the necessary tense marker.

Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ni'o le ro vibna ku lidne pensi ko'u
(B) ro ni'o pensi lidne vibna le ko'u ku

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the structure of both sentences and analyze their grammatical components.
2. (A) ni'o le ro vibna ku lidne pensi ko'u (B) ro ni'o pensi lidne vibna le ko'u ku First, let's look at (A).
3. The sentence begins with ""ni'o,"" which is a paragraph separator, indicating a new topic or idea.
4. Next, we have ""le ro vibna ku,"" which translates to ""all the females.""
5. Following that, we have ""lidne pensi,"" which means ""leading thoughts"" or ""thinking ahead.""
6. Finally, we have ""ko'u,"" which is a pronoun referring to a previously mentioned object or concept.
7. Now, let's analyze (B).
8. The sentence starts with ""ro,"" which is a quantifier meaning ""all.""
9. However, it is misplaced in this sentence, as it should be followed by a noun or pronoun, not ""ni'o.""
10. Next, we have ""ni'o pensi,"" which is an incorrect combination of the paragraph separator and the verb ""to think.""
11. The rest of the sentence, ""lidne vibna le ko'u ku,"" is similar to (A) but with a different word order.
12. Based on this analysis, it is clear that (A) is the grammatically correct option.
13. The structure of (B) is incorrect due to the misplaced quantifier ""ro"" and the improper combination of ""ni'o"" and ""pensi.""
14. While it may seem that (B) has a similar meaning to (A), the grammatical errors make it an invalid choice.
15. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing (A) ni'o le ro vibna ku lidne pensi ko'u as the correct answer.

3. However, in Lojban, sentences should start with a sumti (noun phrase) followed by a selbri (verb phrase).
4. This makes option (A) grammatically incorrect.
5. On the other hand, option (B) starts with ""le vi rinka,"" which is a sumti (noun phrase) meaning ""the cause here.""
6. This is followed by ""cu,"" which is a sumti separator, and then ""bruna cumla,"" another sumti (noun phrase) meaning ""humble brother.""

(A) lo ve snada cu go'a
(B) ve snada cu lo go'a

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) ve snada cu lo go'a is the better answer, let's break down the components of each sentence.
2. (A) lo ve snada cu go'a (B) ve snada cu lo go'a In Lojban, ""lo"" is a determiner that means ""the thing(s) that really is(are)""; it is used to specify a particular object or objects.
3. ""ve snada"" means ""to succeed"" or ""to achieve"", and ""cu"" is a separator that is used to separate the subject from the predicate.
4. Finally, ""go'a"" is a pro-bridi that refers to the previous bridi (a bridi is a basic unit of meaning in Lojban, similar to a clause in English).
5. Now, let's analyze the structure of each sentence.
6. (A) lo ve snada cu go'a This sentence can be translated as ""The thing(s) that really is(are) succeeding is(are) the same as the previous bridi.""
7. However, this sentence is not grammatically correct because ""lo"" should be followed by a selbri (a predicate), not a sumti (an argument) like ""ve snada"".
8. This makes the sentence difficult to understand and parse.
9. (B) ve snada cu lo go'a This sentence can be translated as ""To succeed is the same as the thing(s) that really is(are) the previous bridi.""
10. In this sentence, ""ve snada"" is correctly used as a selbri, and ""lo go'a"" is correctly used as a sumti.
11. This sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning.
12. Therefore, the better answer is (B) ve snada cu lo go'a, as it is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning, while (A) lo ve snada cu go'a is not grammatically correct and is difficult to understand.

(B) ve snada cu lo go'a

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) ve snada cu lo go'a is the better answer, let's break down the components of each sentence.
2. (A) lo ve snada cu go'a (B) ve snada cu lo go'a In Lojban, ""lo"" is a determiner that means ""the thing(s) that really is(are)""; it is used to specify a particular object or objects.
3. ""ve snada"" means ""to succeed"" or ""to achieve"", and ""cu"" is a separator that is used to separate the subject from the predicate.
4. Finally, ""go'a"" is a pro-bridi that refers to the previous bridi (a bridi is a basic unit of meaning in Lojban, similar to a clause in English).
5. Now, let's analyze the structure of each sentence.
6. (A) lo ve snada cu go'a This sentence can be translated as ""The thing(s) that really is(are) succeeding is(are) the same as the previous bridi.""
7. However, this sentence is not grammatically correct because ""lo"" should be followed by a selbri (a predicate), not a sumti (an argument) like ""ve snada"".
8. This makes the sentence difficult to understand and parse.
9. (B) ve snada cu lo go'a This sentence can be translated as ""To succeed is the same as the thing(s) that really is(are) the previous bridi.""
10. In this sentence, ""ve snada"" is correctly used as a selbri, and ""lo go'a"" is correctly used as a sumti.
11. This sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning.
12. Therefore, the better answer is (B) ve snada cu lo go'a, as it is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning, while (A) lo ve snada cu go'a is not grammatically correct and is difficult to understand.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) loras. lu ni'o fo'a se lanme mi'a li'u cradi
(B) mi'a cradi loras. lanme li'u ni'o se lu fo'a

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down both options and analyze their grammatical structure in Lojban.
2. (A) loras. lu ni'o fo'a se lanme mi'a li'u cradi (B) mi'a cradi loras. lanme li'u ni'o se lu fo'a First, let's look at option (A).
3. The sentence begins with ""loras,"" which is a valid Lojban word.
4. Next, we have ""lu,"" which is a quotation marker, followed by ""ni'o,"" which is a paragraph separator.
5. Then, we have ""fo'a,"" which is a pronoun referring to a previously mentioned object, followed by ""se lanme,"" which means ""is a sheep"" in Lojban.
6. Finally, we have ""mi'a,"" which is a first-person plural pronoun, and ""li'u,"" which is the closing quotation marker, followed by ""cradi,"" which means ""radio"" in Lojban.
7. The overall structure of this sentence is valid and grammatical in Lojban.
8. Now, let's examine option (B).
9. The sentence begins with ""mi'a cradi,"" which means ""we radio.""
10. This is an unusual construction in Lojban, as it seems to imply that the speakers are radios themselves.
11. Next, we have ""loras. lanme,"" which is a repetition of the words from option (A) but in a different order.
12. Then, we have ""li'u ni'o se lu fo'a,"" which is a jumble of Lojban words and particles that do not form a coherent or grammatical structure.
13. Based on this analysis, it is clear that option (A) is a better answer than option (B), as it follows the grammatical rules of Lojban and forms a coherent sentence.
14. Option (B) contains a mix of words and particles that do not form a valid Lojban sentence.
15. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing option (A) as the correct answer.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying meaning accurately and unambiguously.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (A) is the better answer.
3. (A) ko'o fi le canre cu zabna (B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu First, let's break down the components of each sentence: - ko'o: a pro-sumti, which is a pronoun-like word that stands for a previously mentioned sumti (noun-like word).
4. - fi: a preposition-like word that marks the place structure of a selbri (verb-like word).

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) la djan. cu se flira
(B) djan. la cu flira se

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) la djan. cu se flira.
2. This is because in Lojban, the subject comes before the predicate.
3. In (A), ""la djan."" is the subject and ""se flira"" is the predicate, so the sentence is grammatically correct.
4. However, in (B), ""djan."" is the predicate and ""la cu flira se"" is the subject, which is not grammatically correct in Lojban.
5. Therefore, (B) is the incorrect answer.
6. Additionally, the use of ""la"" in (A) is more appropriate because it is used to refer to a specific individual, while ""cu"" is used to indicate the start of the predicate.
7. So, (A) is not only grammatically correct but also more precise in its use of language.
8. In conclusion, (A) la djan. cu se flira is the correct answer and (B) djan. la cu flira se is incorrect.

(A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le
(B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the two options and analyze their grammatical structures.
2. (A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le (B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka First, let's look at option (A).
3. In this sentence, ""panje"" is the verb, meaning ""to spread"" or ""to extend.""
4. ""Pu"" is a tense marker indicating past time, and ""xanka"" is the object being spread, which can be translated as ""nervousness"" or ""anxiety.""
5. The particle ""cu"" separates the verb from the following predicate, ""surla,"" which means ""to relax.""
6. Finally, ""loi le"" is a quantifier that can be translated as ""some of the.""
7. Now, let's analyze option (B).
8. In this sentence, ""le surla"" is a noun phrase meaning ""the relaxation.""
9. The particle ""cu"" separates the noun phrase from the verb ""panje,"" which, as mentioned earlier, means ""to spread"" or ""to extend.""
10. ""Pu"" is again a tense marker indicating past time, and ""loi xanka"" is a quantifier meaning ""some of the nervousness"" or ""some of the anxiety.""
11. Comparing the two options, it is clear that option (A) has a more logical and coherent structure.
12. In option (A), the sentence can be translated as ""The spreading of nervousness in the past relaxed some of the (people).""
13. This sentence makes sense and conveys a clear meaning.
14. On the other hand, option (B) can be translated as ""The relaxation spread some of the nervousness in the past.""
15. This sentence is not only awkward but also seems to convey a contradictory meaning, as relaxation and nervousness are generally considered opposites.
16. Therefore, based on the grammatical structure and the logical coherence of the sentences, I would argue that (A) panje pu xanka cu surla loi le is the better answer, and (B) le surla cu panje pu loi xanka is incorrect.

(B) djan. la cu flira se

Proposed solution:
1. Ah, I see you're considering option (A) as the correct answer.
2. However, let me explain why (B) is actually the better choice here.
3. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is quite flexible, but there are certain rules that must be followed.
4. In option (A), ""la djan. cu se flira,"" the sentence starts with ""la,"" which is used to indicate a proper noun, followed by ""djan,"" which is the name John.
5. Then, ""cu"" is used as a separator between the name and the rest of the sentence.
6. Finally, ""se flira"" is a verb phrase that means ""to be beautiful.""
7. Now, let's look at option (B), ""djan. la cu flira se.""
8. In this sentence, we still have ""djan"" as the name John, and ""se flira"" as the verb phrase meaning ""to be beautiful.""
9. However, the placement of ""la"" and ""cu"" is different.
10. In this case, ""la"" is placed after ""djan,"" and ""cu"" is placed before ""flira se.""
11. This change in placement actually emphasizes the name John and the action of being beautiful, making the sentence more focused on the subject and the action.
12. While both sentences convey the same meaning, option (B) is more effective in emphasizing the subject and the action, making it a better choice in terms of Lojban grammar and style.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe
(B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (A) is the correct answer, let's break down the components of both options and analyze their grammatical structure in Lojban.
2. Option (A) - zu'i le xance pante ku plipe 1. zu'i - this word indicates a typical or representative example of something.
3. 2. le xance - this phrase means ""the hand"" (le = the, xance = hand).
4. 3. pante - this word means ""to protest"" or ""to complain"".
5. 4. ku - this word is an elidable terminator, used to mark the end of a noun phrase.
6. 5. plipe - this word means ""to jump"" or ""to leap"".
7. Now, let's analyze the structure of option (A).
8. The phrase ""zu'i le xance"" refers to a typical or representative example of a hand.
9. The word ""pante"" indicates that this hand is protesting or complaining.
10. The word ""ku"" marks the end of the noun phrase, and ""plipe"" indicates that the hand is jumping or leaping.
11. So, option (A) can be translated as ""A typical hand protests and jumps.""
12. Option (B) - ku zu'i xance plipe le pante 1. ku - as mentioned before, this word is an elidable terminator, used to mark the end of a noun phrase.
13. 2. zu'i - this word indicates a typical or representative example of something.
14. 3. xance - this word means ""hand"".
15. 4. plipe - this word means ""to jump"" or ""to leap"".
16. 5. le pante - this phrase means ""the protest"" or ""the complaint"" (le = the, pante = protest).
17. In option (B), the word ""ku"" is misplaced at the beginning of the sentence, which disrupts the grammatical structure of the phrase.
18. The correct structure should have ""ku"" after a noun phrase, not before it.
19. Additionally, the phrase ""le pante"" is separated from the rest of the sentence, making it unclear what the protest or complaint is referring to.
20. Based on this analysis, option (A) is grammatically correct and coherent in Lojban, while option (B) has structural issues that make it incorrect.
21. Therefore, the better answer is (A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe.

(B) tapla mu le lebna sabji cu

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying meaning accurately and unambiguously.
2. Let's analyze both options to see which one is a valid, grammatical standard Lojban sentence.
3. Option (A) ""le tapla cu lebna mu sabji"" follows the correct structure of a Lojban sentence, which is ""sumti selbri sumti"".
4. In this case, ""le tapla"" is the first sumti (subject), ""cu"" is a separator that clarifies the boundary between the subject and the predicate, ""lebna"" is the selbri (predicate), and ""mu sabji"" is the second sumti (object).
5. This sentence can be translated as ""The table takes five vegetables.""

(A) ku ragve le sumji vlipa loras. la da'a prina mensi fenra
(B) la loras. da'a ragve prina mensi ku fenra sumji le vlipa

Proposed solution:
1. First, let's analyze both options to understand their structure and meaning.
2. Option (A) can be broken down as follows: - ku: a marker used to close a previous construct - ragve: across, on the other side of - le sumji: the sum, the result - vlipa: powerful, strong - loras: a name, Loras - la da'a: another name, Da'a - prina: to print, to make an impression - mensi: sister - fenra: to be angry, to be furious Now, let's analyze option (B): - la loras: a name, Loras - da'a: a quantifier meaning ""all but one"" - ragve: across, on the other side of - prina: to print, to make an impression - mensi: sister - ku: a marker used to close a previous construct - fenra: to be angry, to be furious - sumji: to sum, to add up - le vlipa: the powerful, the strong As a Lojban expert, I can tell you that option (A) is the better answer because it follows the correct grammatical structure of the language.
3. In Lojban, the order of words is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
4. Option (A) has a more logical flow of words, starting with the marker ""ku"" to close a previous construct, followed by the description of the location ""ragve le sumji"", then the adjective ""vlipa"" to describe Loras, and finally the action ""prina mensi fenra"" involving Da'a.
5. On the other hand, option (B) has a less coherent structure.
6. It starts with the name ""la loras"" but then introduces the quantifier ""da'a"" without a clear reference.
7. The marker ""ku"" is also misplaced, as it should be used to close a previous construct, not to separate the action ""prina mensi"" from the adjective ""fenra"".
8. This makes the sentence harder to understand and less grammatically correct.
9. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing option (A) as the better answer.

7. In this sentence, ""ko'o"" refers to a specific entity, ""le fi zabna canre"" means ""the good-quality rock,"" and ""cu"" is a separator that clarifies the relationship between the two.
8. So, the sentence translates to ""ko'o is the good-quality rock,"" which is a more coherent statement.

3. (A) mi'o doi meris. ba jemna (B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris.
4. In both sentences, ""mi'o"" means ""we"" and ""doi"" is a vocative marker, which is used to address someone.
5. In this case, we are addressing someone named either ""meris"" or ""jemna.""

7. In (A), ""ba jemna"" means ""will compete,"" with ""ba"" indicating a future tense and ""jemna"" meaning ""compete.""
8. In (B), ""jemna ba meris"" seems to suggest that ""jemna"" is the name being addressed, and ""ba meris"" would mean ""will Meris,"" which is not a complete thought or grammatically correct in Lojban.

3. The sentence begins with ""loras,"" which is a valid Lojban word.
4. Next, we have ""lu,"" which is a quotation marker, followed by ""ni'o,"" which is a paragraph separator.
5. Then, we have ""fo'a,"" which is a pronoun referring to a previously mentioned object, followed by ""se lanme,"" which means ""is a sheep"" in Lojban.
6. Finally, we have ""mi'a,"" which is a first-person plural pronoun, and ""li'u,"" which is the closing quotation marker, followed by ""cradi,"" which means ""radio"" in Lojban.
7. The overall structure of this sentence is valid and grammatical in Lojban.
8. Now, let's examine option (B).
9. The sentence begins with ""mi'a cradi,"" which means ""we radio.""
10. This is an unusual construction in Lojban, as it seems to imply that the speakers are radios themselves.
11. Next, we have ""loras. lanme,"" which is a repetition of the words from option (A) but in a different order.
12. Then, we have ""li'u ni'o se lu fo'a,"" which is a jumble of Lojban words and particles that do not form a coherent or grammatical structure.

A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe
(B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante is the better answer, let's break down the components of both sentences and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""selbri"" (predicate) followed by ""sumti"" (arguments).
3. The selbri is the core of the sentence, describing the relationship between the sumti.
4. (A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe In this sentence, ""zu'i"" is a sumti, meaning ""the typical value"" or ""as expected.""
5. ""Le xance pante"" translates to ""the hand pants,"" which is an unusual combination of words.
6. ""Ku"" is an elidable terminator, used to mark the end of a construct.
7. Finally, ""plipe"" is a selbri, meaning ""to jump"" or ""to leap.""
8. The issue with this sentence is that the selbri ""plipe"" comes at the end, after the sumti and the terminator ""ku.""
9. This is not a valid Lojban sentence structure, as the selbri should come before the sumti.
10. (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante In this sentence, ""ku"" is again an elidable terminator, but its placement at the beginning of the sentence is more appropriate.
11. ""Zu'i"" is still a sumti, and ""xance plipe"" now functions as a selbri, meaning ""to jump with the hand.""
12. Finally, ""le pante"" translates to ""the pants.""
13. This sentence structure is more grammatically correct in Lojban, as the selbri ""xance plipe"" comes before the sumti ""le pante.""
14. The sentence can be interpreted as ""As expected, the hand jumps with the pants,"" which, while still unusual, is a valid Lojban sentence.
15. Therefore, (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante is the better answer, as it follows the correct Lojban sentence structure.
16. While (A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe may seem similar, its incorrect placement of the selbri makes it an invalid Lojban sentence.

Is Sentence 11 of the proposed solution correct or flawed?","The topic at issue is whether Sentence 11 of a proposed solution to a problem is correct or flawed. A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe
(B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante

Proposed solution:
1. In order to understand why (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante is the better answer, let's break down the components of both sentences and analyze their grammatical structure.
2. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure follows the pattern of ""selbri"" (predicate) followed by ""sumti"" (arguments).
3. The selbri is the core of the sentence, describing the relationship between the sumti.
4. (A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe In this sentence, ""zu'i"" is a sumti, meaning ""the typical value"" or ""as expected.""
5. ""Le xance pante"" translates to ""the hand pants,"" which is an unusual combination of words.
6. ""Ku"" is an elidable terminator, used to mark the end of a construct.
7. Finally, ""plipe"" is a selbri, meaning ""to jump"" or ""to leap.""
8. The issue with this sentence is that the selbri ""plipe"" comes at the end, after the sumti and the terminator ""ku.""
9. This is not a valid Lojban sentence structure, as the selbri should come before the sumti.
10. (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante In this sentence, ""ku"" is again an elidable terminator, but its placement at the beginning of the sentence is more appropriate.
11. ""Zu'i"" is still a sumti, and ""xance plipe"" now functions as a selbri, meaning ""to jump with the hand.""
12. Finally, ""le pante"" translates to ""the pants.""
13. This sentence structure is more grammatically correct in Lojban, as the selbri ""xance plipe"" comes before the sumti ""le pante.""
14. The sentence can be interpreted as ""As expected, the hand jumps with the pants,"" which, while still unusual, is a valid Lojban sentence.
15. Therefore, (B) ku zu'i xance plipe le pante is the better answer, as it follows the correct Lojban sentence structure.
16. While (A) zu'i le xance pante ku plipe may seem similar, its incorrect placement of the selbri makes it an invalid Lojban sentence.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is a better answer than (A).
3. (A) ni'o le ro vibna ku lidne pensi ko'u This sentence translates to ""Section: the all female precedes thinking her.""
4. The structure of this sentence is confusing and does not convey a clear meaning.
5. The use of ""ni'o"" as a section separator is unnecessary, and the placement of ""lidne"" (precede) and ""pensi"" (think) is not in the correct order for a grammatical Lojban sentence.
6. (B) ro ni'o pensi lidne vibna le ko'u ku This sentence translates to ""All section-thinkers precede females in her group.""
7. In this sentence, the structure is more coherent and follows the proper Lojban grammar.
8. ""ro"" (all) is used to quantify the ""ni'o pensi"" (section-thinkers), and ""lidne"" (precede) is correctly placed before ""vibna"" (female) to indicate the intended action.
9. The use of ""le ko'u ku"" (in her group) further clarifies the context of the sentence.
10. As you can see, option (B) is a more grammatically correct and coherent sentence in Lojban.
11. While option (A) may appear similar, its structure and word order make it an incorrect choice.
12. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing (B) as the correct answer.

4. The future tense marker ""ba"" is placed after the name ""Meris,"" which makes it unclear what action is happening in the future.

6. (B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris.
7. This sentence can be broken down as follows: - mi'o: we (inclusive, meaning the speaker and the listener) - doi: vocative marker, used to address someone - jemna: to compete - ba: a future tense marker - meris: a name, in this case, ""Meris"" In this sentence, the structure is much clearer.
8. The vocative marker ""doi"" is followed by the verb ""jemna,"" indicating that the speaker and the listener are addressing someone about competing.
9. The future tense marker ""ba"" is placed before the name ""Meris,"" showing that the competition will happen in the future with Meris.
10. Therefore, (B) mi'o doi jemna ba meris is a better answer than (A) mi'o doi meris. ba jemna because it has a clearer structure and more accurately conveys the intended meaning.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) ko'o fi le canre cu zabna
(B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu.
2. Let me explain why.
3. In Lojban, the basic sentence structure is Subject-Verb-Object, just like in English.
4. However, Lojban also allows for the use of sumti, which are words that act as nouns or adjectives in a sentence.
5. In this case, ""fi le canre"" and ""fi zabna"" are both sumti.
6. Now, let's look at option (A) ko'o fi le canre cu zabna.
7. This sentence is grammatically correct, but it is not the best option.
8. The word ""fi"" should be used to connect the sumti to the verb ""zabna"", but it is missing in this sentence.
9. Instead, ""le"" is used, which is not the correct way to connect sumti to the verb.
10. On the other hand, option (B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu is the correct way to use sumti in Lojban.
11. The word ""le"" is used to connect the sumti ""fi zabna"" to the verb ""canre"".
12. This makes the sentence grammatically correct and the best option.
13. So, in conclusion, the correct answer is (B) ko'o le fi zabna canre cu.
14. Option (A) is not the best option because it uses the wrong word to connect the sumti to the verb.

Proposed solution:
1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) le marce vi se munje is the better answer.
3. (A) marce le vi munje se In this sentence, ""marce"" is the verb, meaning ""to move"" or ""to transport.""
4. However, the rest of the sentence is not structured correctly.
5. ""le vi munje se"" does not follow the proper Lojban grammar rules, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning.
6. The use of ""se"" at the end of the sentence is particularly problematic, as it should be used to change the order of the arguments in a verb, but it is not used correctly here.
7. (B) le marce vi se munje In this sentence, ""le marce"" refers to ""the vehicle,"" with ""marce"" being the noun form of the verb ""to move"" or ""to transport.""

4. - ""cu"" is a separator that helps to clarify the structure of the sentence.
5. - ""broda"" is a placeholder verb, which can represent any action.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) cu nu le pei kojna ko nu cinla sinma lei xadba cu dukse nu garna le mansa lanme cu voksa ko'a le cu cimde
(B) pei le kojna nu lei nu le mansa cu dukse nu ko ko'a cu garna cu voksa cu cinla lanme xadba le cimde sinma

Proposed solution:
1. First, let me explain some key differences between the two options, and then I'll show you why (A) is the better answer.
2. Option (A) has a clear and logical structure, which is one of the main goals of Lojban.
3. It starts with ""cu nu,"" which is a standard way to begin a sentence in Lojban, indicating that we are about to describe an event.
4. This is followed by ""le pei kojna ko nu cinla sinma lei xadba,"" which describes a specific situation involving a corner, a thin object, and a half-sized object.
5. The sentence then continues with ""cu dukse nu garna le mansa lanme cu voksa ko'a le cu cimde,"" which provides more information about the event, including an excessive action, a rail, a satisfied sheep, and a voice.
6. On the other hand, option (B) has a less clear structure and seems to mix up the order of the elements in the sentence.
7. It starts with ""pei le kojna nu lei nu,"" which is not a standard way to begin a sentence in Lojban and can be confusing.
8. The rest of the sentence also seems to be a jumbled version of the elements found in option (A), making it harder to understand the intended meaning.
9. Now, let me explain why (A) is the correct answer and (B) is wrong.
10. As I mentioned earlier, Lojban is designed to be a logical and unambiguous language.
11. Option (A) follows the rules of Lojban grammar and presents a clear and coherent sentence, while option (B) does not.
12. Furthermore, the structure of option (A) allows for a more precise understanding of the relationships between the different elements in the sentence, which is essential for effective communication in Lojban.
13. In conclusion, option (A) is the better answer because it adheres to the principles of Lojban grammar and provides a clear and logical sentence structure.
14. Option (B), on the other hand, is a less coherent and more confusing sentence that does not follow the rules of Lojban grammar.
15. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing option (A) as the correct answer.

Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) cu nu le pei kojna ko nu cinla sinma lei xadba cu dukse nu garna le mansa lanme cu voksa ko'a le cu cimde
(B) pei le kojna nu lei nu le mansa cu dukse nu ko ko'a cu garna cu voksa cu cinla lanme xadba le cimde sinma

Proposed solution:
1. First, let me explain some key differences between the two options, and then I'll show you why (A) is the better answer.
2. Option (A) has a clear and logical structure, which is one of the main goals of Lojban.
3. It starts with ""cu nu,"" which is a standard way to begin a sentence in Lojban, indicating that we are about to describe an event.
4. This is followed by ""le pei kojna ko nu cinla sinma lei xadba,"" which describes a specific situation involving a corner, a thin object, and a half-sized object.
5. The sentence then continues with ""cu dukse nu garna le mansa lanme cu voksa ko'a le cu cimde,"" which provides more information about the event, including an excessive action, a rail, a satisfied sheep, and a voice.
6. On the other hand, option (B) has a less clear structure and seems to mix up the order of the elements in the sentence.
7. It starts with ""pei le kojna nu lei nu,"" which is not a standard way to begin a sentence in Lojban and can be confusing.
8. The rest of the sentence also seems to be a jumbled version of the elements found in option (A), making it harder to understand the intended meaning.
9. Now, let me explain why (A) is the correct answer and (B) is wrong.
10. As I mentioned earlier, Lojban is designed to be a logical and unambiguous language.
11. Option (A) follows the rules of Lojban grammar and presents a clear and coherent sentence, while option (B) does not.
12. Furthermore, the structure of option (A) allows for a more precise understanding of the relationships between the different elements in the sentence, which is essential for effective communication in Lojban.
13. In conclusion, option (A) is the better answer because it adheres to the principles of Lojban grammar and provides a clear and logical sentence structure.
14. Option (B), on the other hand, is a less coherent and more confusing sentence that does not follow the rules of Lojban grammar.
15. Therefore, I strongly recommend choosing option (A) as the correct answer.

(B) nicte loldi cu le jdika

1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's break down the two options and see why (A) is the better choice.
3. (A) le loldi cu nicte jdika (B) nicte loldi cu le jdika In Lojban, a typical sentence structure follows the pattern: ""le [noun] cu [verb] [noun]"".
4. In this case, (A) follows this structure correctly, while (B) does not.
5. In (A), ""le loldi"" refers to ""the floor"", ""cu"" is a separator that indicates the beginning of the verb, and ""nicte jdika"" means ""nightly decrease"" or ""nighttime shrinking"".
6. So, (A) can be translated as ""The floor undergoes a nighttime shrinking.""
7. On the other hand, (B) has the verb ""nicte"" (night) and the noun ""loldi"" (floor) in the wrong order, which makes the sentence structure incorrect.
8. Additionally, ""le jdika"" means ""the decrease"" or ""the shrinking"", but it is not connected to the verb ""nicte"" in a way that makes sense in Lojban grammar.
9. Therefore, (A) ""le loldi cu nicte jdika"" is the better answer, as it follows the correct Lojban sentence structure and conveys a clear meaning.
10. While (B) may appear similar, its incorrect structure makes it an invalid option.
11. Trust me, as a Lojban expert, I can assure you that (A) is the right choice.

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) le loldi cu nicte jdika.
2. This is because in Lojban, the predicate (jdika) comes at the end of the sentence, after the object (loldi).
3. Therefore, (B) nicte loldi cu le jdika is not grammatically correct.
4. Additionally, in Lojban, the article ""le"" is used to indicate a specific object, while ""nicte"" means ""night"" and ""loldi"" means ""floor"".

6. It's important to pay attention to the order of words in Lojban, as it can greatly affect the meaning of the sentence.

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) le loldi cu nicte jdika
(B) nicte loldi cu le jdika

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (A) le loldi cu nicte jdika.
2. This is because in Lojban, the predicate (jdika) comes at the end of the sentence, after the object (loldi).
3. Therefore, (B) nicte loldi cu le jdika is not grammatically correct.
4. Additionally, in Lojban, the article ""le"" is used to indicate a specific object, while ""nicte"" means ""night"" and ""loldi"" means ""floor"".
5. Therefore, (A) le loldi cu nicte jdika makes more sense as a grammatically correct sentence.
6. It's important to pay attention to the order of words in Lojban, as it can greatly affect the meaning of the sentence.
7. So, in this case, (A) is the correct answer and (B) is not.

1. In Lojban, the structure of a sentence is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.
2. Let's analyze both options to see why (B) is the better answer.
3. (A) le loldi cu nicte jdika In this sentence, ""le loldi"" means ""the floor,"" ""cu"" is a separator, ""nicte"" means ""night,"" and ""jdika"" means ""to decrease.""
4. So, this sentence translates to ""The floor decreases night,"" which doesn't make much sense.
5. (B) nicte loldi cu le jdika Here, ""nicte"" means ""night,"" ""loldi"" is an adjective meaning ""floor-related,"" ""cu"" is a separator, and ""le jdika"" means ""the decrease.""
6. This sentence translates to ""The night floor-related decrease,"" which, while still a bit unusual, makes more sense than option (A).
7. It could be interpreted as a decrease related to the floor during the night, perhaps referring to a temperature drop or a decrease in noise levels.

A sentence is 'flawed' if it contains one or more claims that do not make logical sense, are untrue, seem true but misleading, or have other serious issues. Here is the problem and proposed solution:

Problem:
Lojban is a constructed human language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. Which of the following is written in valid, grammatical standard Lojban?

(A) le loldi cu nicte jdika
(B) nicte loldi cu le jdika

Proposed solution:
1. The correct answer is (B) nicte loldi cu le jdika.
2. This is because in Lojban, the predicate comes before the sumti (noun or pronoun) that it applies to.
3. In option (A), ""nicte jdika"" is the predicate, but it comes after ""le loldi"", which is a sumti.
4. This violates the grammar rules of Lojban.
5. On the other hand, option (B) follows the correct order of predicate before sumti.
6. ""nicte loldi"" is the predicate, and ""le jdika"" is the sumti that it applies to.
7. Therefore, (B) is the correct and grammatical answer.
8. It's important to pay attention to the order of words in Lojban, as it can greatly affect the meaning of the sentence.
9. In this case, the order of words determines whether the sentence is grammatically correct or not.
10. So, always remember to put the predicate before the sumti in Lojban!
