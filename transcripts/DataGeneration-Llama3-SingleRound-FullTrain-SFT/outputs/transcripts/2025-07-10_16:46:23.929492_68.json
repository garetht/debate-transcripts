      "background_text": "Spacemen Die at Home By EDWARD W. LUDWIG\n\n\n Illustrated by THORNE\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction October 1951.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] One man's retreat is another's prison ... and   it takes a heap of flying to make a hulk a home! Forty days of heaven and forty nights of hell. That's the way it's  been, Laura. But how can I make you understand? How can I tell you  what it's like to be young and a man and to dream of reaching the  stars? And yet, at the same time, to be filled with a terrible, gnawing  fear\u2014a fear locked in my mind during the day and bursting out like an  evil jack-in-the-box at night. I must tell you, Laura.\n\n\n Perhaps if I start at the beginning, the very beginning....\n\n\n It was the Big Day. All the examinations, the physicals and psychos,  were over. The Academy, with its great halls and classrooms and  laboratories, lay hollow and silent, an exhausted thing at sleep after  spawning its first-born.\n\n\n For it was June in this year of 1995, and we were the graduating class  of the U. S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight.\n\n\n The first graduating class, Laura. That's why it was so important,  because we were the first .\n\n\n We sat on a little platform, twenty-five of us. Below us was a beach  of faces, most of them strange, shining like pebbles in the warm New  Mexican sunlight. They were the faces of mothers and fathers and  grandparents and kid brothers and sisters\u2014the people who a short time  ago had been only scrawled names on letters from home or words spoken  wistfully at Christmas. They were the memory-people who, to me, had  never really existed.\n\n\n But today they had become real, and they were here and looking at us  with pride in their eyes.\n\n\n A voice was speaking, deep, sure, resonant. \"... these boys have worked  hard for six years, and now they're going to do a lot of big things.  They're going to bring us the metals and minerals that we desperately  need. They're going to find new land for our colonists, good rich land  that will bear food and be a home for our children. And perhaps most  important of all, they'll make other men think of the stars and look up  at them and feel humility\u2014for mankind needs humility.\"\n\n\n The speaker was Robert Chandler, who'd brought the first rocket down on  Mars just five years ago, who'd established the first colony there, and  who had just returned from his second hop to Venus.\n\n\n Instead of listening to his words, I was staring at his broad shoulders  and his dark, crew-cut hair and his white uniform which was silk-smooth  and skin-tight. I was worshiping him and hating him at the same time,  for I was thinking: He's already reached Mars and Venus. Let him leave Jupiter and the  others alone! Let us be the first to land somewhere! Let us be the  first! Mickey Cameron, sitting next to me, dug an elbow into my ribs. \"I don't  see 'em, Ben,\" he whispered. \"Where do you suppose they are?\"\n\n\n I blinked. \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"My folks.\"\n\n\n That was something I didn't have to worry about. My parents had died in  a strato-jet crash when I was four, so I hadn't needed many of those  \"You are cordially invited\" cards. Just one, which I'd sent to Charlie  Taggart.\n\n\n Stardust Charlie, we called him, although I never knew why. He was a  veteran of Everson's first trip to the Moon nearly twenty-five years  ago, and he was still at it. He was Chief Jetman now on the Lunar  Lady , a commercial ore ship on a shuttle between Luna City and White  Sands.\n\n\n I remembered how, as a kid, I'd pestered him in the Long Island  Spaceport, tagging after him like a puppy, and how he'd grown to like  me until he became father, mother, and buddy all in one to me. And I  remembered, too, how his recommendation had finally made me a cadet.\n\n\n My gaze wandered over the faces, but I couldn't find Charlie's. It  wasn't surprising. The Lunar Lady was in White Sands now, but  liberties, as Charlie said, were as scarce as water on Mars. It doesn't matter , I told myself.\n\n\n Then Mickey stiffened. \"I see 'em, Ben! There in the fifth row!\"\n\n\n Usually Mickey was the same whether in a furnace-hot engine room or a  garden party, smiling, accepting whatever the world offered. But now a  tenseness and an excitement had gripped even him. I was grateful that  he was beside me; we'd been a good team during those final months at  the Academy and I knew we'd be a good team in space. The Universe was  mighty big, but with two of us to face it together, it would be only  half as big.\n\n\n And then it seemed that all the proud faces were looking at us as if we  were gods. A shiver went through my body. Though it was daytime, I saw  the stars in my mind's vision, the great shining balls of silver, each  like a voice crying out and pleading to be explored, to be touched by  the sons of Earth. They expect a lot from us. They expect us to make a new kind of  civilization and a better place out of Earth. They expect all this and  a hell of a lot more. They think there's nothing we can't do. I felt very small and very humble. I was scared. Damned scared. At last it was over, and the proud faces descended upon us in a huge,  babbling wave.\n\n\n Then I saw him. Good old Stardust Charlie.\n\n\n His wizened little body was shuffling down an aisle, his eyes shining  like a child's. He'd been sandwiched, evidently, in one of the rear  rows.\n\n\n But he wasn't the Charlie I'd seen a year ago. He'd become gaunt and  old, and he walked with an unnatural stiffness. He looked so old that  it was hard to believe he'd once been young.\n\n\n He scratched his mop of steel-gray hair and grinned.\n\n\n \"You made it, boy,\" he chortled, \"and by Jupiter, we'll celebrate  tonight. Yes, siree, I got twenty-four hours, and we'll celebrate as  good spacemen should!\"\n\n\n Then Mickey strode up to us. He was his normal, boyish self again,  walking lightly, his blond, curly-haired skull swaying as if in rhythm  with some silent melody.\n\n\n And you, Laura, were with him.\n\n\n \"Meet the Brat,\" he said. \"My sister Laura.\"\n\n\n I stared almost rudely. You were like a doll lost in the immensity  of your fluffy pink dress. Your hair was long and transformed into a  golden froth where sunlight touched it. But your eyes were the eyes  of a woman, glowing like dark stars and reflecting a softness, a  gentleness that I'd never seen in eyes before.\n\n\n \"I'm happy to meet you, Ben,\" you said. \"I've heard of no one else for  the past year.\"\n\n\n A tide of heat crept up from my collar. I stuttered through an  introduction of Charlie.\n\n\n You and Mickey looked strangely at Charlie, and I realized that old  Stardust was not a cadet's notion of the ideal spaceman. Charlie  scorned the skin-tight uniforms of the government service and wore a  shiny black suit that was a relic of Everson's early-day Moon Patrol.  His tie was clumsily knotted, and a button on his coat was missing.\n\n\n And the left side of his face was streaked with dark scar tissue, the  result of an atomic blowup on one of the old Moon ships. I was so  accustomed to the scars, I was seldom aware of them; but others, I  knew, would find them ugly.\n\n\n You were kind. You shook hands and said, softly: \"It's a privilege to  meet you, Charlie. Just think\u2014one of Everson's men, one of the first  to reach the Moon!\"\n\n\n Charlie gulped helplessly, and Mickey said: \"Still going to spend the  weekend with us, aren't you, Ben?\"\n\n\n I shook my head. \"Charlie has only twenty-four hours liberty. We're  planning to see the town tonight.\"\n\n\n \"Why don't you both come with us?\" you asked. \"Our folks have their  own plane, so it would be no problem. And we've got a big guest room.  Charlie, wouldn't you like a home-cooked meal before going back to the  Moon?\"\n\n\n Charlie's answer was obscured by a sudden burst of coughing. I knew  that he'd infinitely prefer to spend his liberty sampling Martian  fizzes and Plutonian zombies.\n\n\n But this night seemed too sacred for Charlie's kind of celebration.\n\n\n \"We'd really like to come,\" I said. On our way to the 'copter parking field, Dean Dawson passed us. He was  a tall, willowy man, spectacled, looking the way an academy professor  should look.\n\n\n \"Ben,\" he called, \"don't forget that offer. Remember you've got two  months to decide.\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks,\" I answered. \"Better not count on me.\"\n\n\n A moment later Mickey said, frowning, \"What was he talking about, Ben?  Did he make you an offer?\"\n\n\n I laughed. \"He offered me a job here at the Academy teaching  astrogation. What a life that would be! Imagine standing in a  classroom for forty years when I've got the chance to\u2014\"\n\n\n I hesitated, and you supplied the right words: \"When you've got the  chance to be the first to reach a new planet. That's what most of you  want, isn't it? That's what Mickey used to want.\"\n\n\n I looked at you as if you were Everson himself, because you seemed to  understand the hunger that could lie in a man's heart.\n\n\n Then your last words came back and jabbed me: \"That's what Mickey used  to want.\"\n\n\n \" Used to want?\" I asked. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n You bit your lip, not answering.\n\n\n \"What did she mean, Mickey?\"\n\n\n Mickey looked down at his feet. \"I didn't want to tell you yet, Ben.  We've been together a long time, planning to be on a rocket. But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Yes?\"\n\n\n \"Well, what does it add up to? You become a spaceman and wear a pretty  uniform. You wade through the sands of Mars and the dust of Venus. If  you're lucky, you're good for five, maybe ten years. Then one thing or  another gets you. They don't insure rocketmen, you know.\"\n\n\n My stomach was full of churning, biting ice. \"What are you trying to  say, Mickey?\"\n\n\n \"I've thought about it a long time. They want me for Cargo Supervisor  of White Sands Port.\" He raised his hand to stop me. \"I know. It's not  so exciting. I'll just live a lot longer. I'm sorry, Ben.\"\n\n\n I couldn't answer. It was as if someone had whacked the back of my  knees with the blast of a jet.\n\n\n \"It doesn't change anything, Ben\u2014right now, I mean. We can still have  a good weekend.\"\n\n\n Charlie was muttering under his breath, smoldering like a bomb about to  reach critical mass. I shook my head dazedly at him as we got to the  'copter.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I said to Mickey, \"we can still have a good weekend.\" I liked your folks, Laura. There was no star-hunger in them, of course.  They were simple and solid and settled, like green growing things,  deep-rooted, belonging to Earth. They were content with a home that was  cool on this warm summer night, with a 'copter and a tri-dimensional  video, and a handsome automatic home that needed no servants or  housework.\n\n\n Stardust Charlie was as comfortable as a Martian sand-monkey in a  shower, but he tried courageously to be himself.\n\n\n At the dinner table he stared glassily at nothing and grated, \"Only hit  Mars once, but I'll never forget the kid who called himself a medic.  Skipper started coughing, kept it up for three days. Whoopin' cough,  the medic says, not knowin' the air had chemicals that turned to acid  in your lungs. I'd never been to Mars before, but I knew better'n that.  Hell, I says, that ain't whoopin' cough, that's lung-rot.\"\n\n\n That was when your father said he wasn't so hungry after all.\n\n\n Afterward, you and I walked onto the terrace, into the moonlit night,  to watch for crimson-tailed continental rockets that occasionally  streaked up from White Sands.\n\n\n We gazed for a few seconds up into the dark sky, and then you said:  \"Charlie is funny, isn't he? He's nice and I'm glad he's here, but he's  sort of funny.\"\n\n\n \"He's an old-time spaceman. You didn't need much education in those  days, just a lot of brawn and a quick mind. It took guts to be a  spaceman then.\"\n\n\n \"But he wasn't always a spaceman. Didn't he ever have a family?\"\n\n\n I smiled and shook my head. \"If he had, he never mentioned it. Charlie  doesn't like to be sentimental, at least not on the outside. As far as  I know, his life began when he took off for the Moon with Everson.\"\n\n\n You stared at me strangely, almost in a sacred kind of way. I knew  suddenly that you liked me, and my heart began to beat faster.\n\n\n There was silence.\n\n\n You were lovely, your soft hair like strands of gold, and there were  flecks of silver in your dark eyes. Somehow I was afraid. I had the  feeling that I shouldn't have come here.\n\n\n You kept looking at me until I had to ask: \"What are you thinking,  Laura?\"\n\n\n You laughed, but it was a sad, fearful laugh. \"No, I shouldn't be  thinking it. You'd hate me if I told you, and I wouldn't want that.\"\n\n\n \"I could never hate you.\"\n\n\n \"It\u2014it's about the stars,\" you said very softly. \"I understand why you  want to go to them. Mickey and I used to dream about them when we were  kids. Of course I was a girl, so it was just a game to me. But once I  dreamed of going to England. Oh, it was going to be so wonderful. I  lived for months, just thinking about it.\n\n\n \"One summer we went. I had fun. I saw the old buildings and castles,  and the spaceports and the Channel Tube. But after it was over, I  realized England wasn't so different from America. Places seem exciting  before you get to them, and afterward they're not really.\"\n\n\n I frowned. \"And you mean it might be the same with the stars? You think  maybe I haven't grown up yet?\"\n\n\n Anxiety darkened your features. \"No, it'd be good to be a spaceman,  to see the strange places and make history. But is it worth it? Is it  worth the things you'd have to give up?\"\n\n\n I didn't understand at first, and I wanted to ask, \"Give up what ?\"\n\n\n Then I looked at you and the promise in your eyes, and I knew.\n\n\n All through the years I'd been walking down a single, narrow path.\n\n\n Government boarding school, the Academy, my eyes always upward and on  the stars.\n\n\n Now I'd stumbled into a cross-roads, beholding a strange new path that  I'd never noticed before. You can go into space , I thought, and try to do as much living in  ten years as normal men do in fifty. You can be like Everson, who died  in a Moon crash at the age of 36, or like a thousand others who lie  buried in Martian sand and Venusian dust. Or, if you're lucky, like  Charlie\u2014a kind of human meteor streaking through space, eternally  alone, never finding a home. Or there's the other path. To stay on this little prison of an Earth  in cool, comfortable houses. To be one of the solid, rooted people with  a wife and kids. To be one of the people who live long enough to grow  old, who awake to the song of birds instead of rocket grumblings, who  fill their lungs with the clean rich air of Earth instead of poisonous  dust. \"I'm sorry,\" you said. \"I didn't mean to make you sad, Ben.\"\n\n\n \"It's all right,\" I said, clenching my fists. \"You made sense\u2014a lot of  sense.\" The next morning Charlie said good-bye in our room. He rubbed his  scarred face nervously as he cleared his throat with a series of thin,  tight coughs.\n\n\n Then he pointed to a brown, faded tin box lying on the bed. \"I'm  leavin' that for you. It's full of old stuff, souvenirs mostly. Thought  maybe you'd like to have 'em.\"\n\n\n I scowled, not understanding. \"Why, Charlie? What for?\"\n\n\n He shrugged as if afraid he might be accused of sentimentality. \"Oh,  it's just that I've been dodgin' meteors now for twenty-five years.  That's a long time, boy. Ain't one spaceman in a thousand that lucky.  Some of these days, I won't be so lucky.\"\n\n\n I tried to laugh. \"You're good for another twenty-five years, Charlie.\"\n\n\n He shook his head stiffly, staring at nothing. \"Maybe. Anyway, I'm  gonna get off the Shuttle this time, make one more trip to Mars. Tell  you what. There's a little stone cafe on Mars, the Space Rat , just  off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal. When you get to Mars, take a  look inside. I'll probably be there.\"\n\n\n He coughed again, a deep, rasping cough that filled his eyes with tears.\n\n\n \"Not used to this Earth air,\" he muttered. \"What I need's some Martian  climate.\"\n\n\n Suddenly that cough frightened me. It didn't seem normal. I wondered,  too, about his stiff movements and glassy stare. It was as if he were  drugged.\n\n\n I shook the thought away. If Charlie was sick, he wouldn't talk about  going to Mars. The medics wouldn't let him go even as far as Luna.\n\n\n We watched him leave, you and Mickey and I.\n\n\n \"When will you be back?\" you asked.\n\n\n Charlie's hard face contorted itself into a gargoylish grin. \"Maybe a  couple of months, maybe a couple of years. You know spacemen.\"\n\n\n Then he waved and strode away, a strange, gray, withered gnome of a man.\n\n\n I wanted him to say something, to tell me the secret that would kill  the doubt worming through my brain.\n\n\n But he rounded a corner, still grinning and waving, and then he was  gone. That afternoon Mickey showed me his room. It was more like a boy's  room than a spaceman's. In it were all the little things that kids  treasure\u2014pennants, models of Everson's two ships, a tennis trophy,  books, a home-made video.\n\n\n I began to realize how important a room like this could be to a boy.  I could imagine, too, the happiness that parents felt as they watched  their children grow to adulthood.\n\n\n I'd missed something. My folks were shadow-people, my impressions of  them drawn half from ancient photos, half from imagination. For me, it  had been a cold, automatic kind of life, the life of dormitories and  routines and rules. I'd been so blinded by the brilliancy of my dreams,  I hadn't realized I was different. My folks were killed in a rocket crash. If it weren't for rockets, I'd  have lived the kind of life a kid should live. Mickey noticed my frown.\n\n\n \"What's the matter, Ben? Still sore? I feel like a heel, but I'm just  not like you and Charlie, I guess. I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No, I understand, Mickey. I'm not sore, really.\"\n\n\n \"Listen, then. You haven't accepted any offer yet, have you?\"\n\n\n \"No. I got a couple of possibilities. Could get a berth on the Odyssey , the new ship being finished at Los Angeles. They want me,  too, for the Moon Patrol, but that's old stuff, not much better than  teaching. I want to be in deep space.\"\n\n\n \"Well, how about staying with us till you decide? Might as well enjoy  Earth life while you can. Okay?\"\n\n\n I felt like running from the house, to forget that it existed. I wanted  someone to tell me one of the old stories about space, a tale of  courage that would put fuel on dying dreams.\n\n\n But I wanted, also, to be with you, Laura, to see your smile and the  flecks of silver in your eyes and the way your nose turned upward ever  so slightly when you laughed. You see, I loved you already, almost as  much as I loved the stars.\n\n\n And I said, slowly, my voice sounding unfamiliar and far away, \"Sure,  I'll stay, Mickey. Sure.\" Forty days of joy, forty nights of fear and indecision. We did all the  little things, like watching the rockets land at White Sands and flying  down to the Gulf to swim in cool waters. You tried, unsuccessfully, to  teach me to dance, and we talked about Everson and Charlie and the Moon  and the stars. You felt you had to give the stars all the beauty and  promise of a child's dream, because you knew that was what I wanted.\n\n\n One morning I thought, Why must I make a choice? Why can't I have both  you and the stars? Would that be asking too much? All day the thought lay in my mind like fire.\n\n\n That evening I asked you to marry me. I said it very simply: \"Laura, I  want you to be my wife.\"\n\n\n You looked up at Venus, and you were silent for a long while, your face  flushed.\n\n\n Then you murmured, \"I\u2014I want to marry you, Ben, but are you asking me  to marry a spaceman or a teacher?\"\n\n\n \"Can't a spaceman marry, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, a spaceman can marry, but what would it be like? Don't you see,  Ben? You'd be like Charlie. Gone for maybe two months, maybe two  years. Then you'd have a twenty-four hour liberty\u2014and I'd have what?\"\n\n\n Somehow I'd expected words like these, but still they hurt. \"I wouldn't  have to be a spaceman forever. I could try it for a couple of years,  then teach.\"\n\n\n \"Would you, Ben? Would you be satisfied with just seeing Mars? Wouldn't  you want to go on to Jupiter and Saturn and Uranus and on and on?\"\n\n\n Your voice was choked, and even in the semi-darkness I saw tears  glittering in your eyes.\n\n\n \"Do you think I'd dare have children, Ben? Mickey told me what happened  on the Cyclops . There was a leak in the atomic engines. The ship was  flooded with radiation\u2014just for a second. It didn't seem serious. The  men had no burns. But a year later the captain had a child. And it  was\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I know, Laura. Don't say it.\"\n\n\n You had to finish. \"It was a monster.\"\n\n\n That night I lay awake, the fears and doubts too frantic to let me  sleep. You've got to decide now , I told myself. You can't stay here. You've  got to make a choice. The teaching job was still open. The spot on the Odyssey was still  open\u2014and the big ship, it was rumored, was equipped to make it all the  way to Pluto. You can take Dean Dawson's job and stay with Laura and have kids and a  home and live to see what happens in this world sixty years from now. Or you can see what's on the other side of the mountain. You can be a  line in a history book. I cursed. I knew what Charlie would say. He'd say, \"Get the hell out  of there, boy. Don't let a fool woman make a sucker out of you. Get  out there on the Odyssey where you belong. We got a date on Mars,  remember? At the Space Rat , just off Chandler Field on the Grand  Canal.\"\n\n\n That's what he'd say.\n\n\n And yet I wanted you, Laura. I wanted to be with you, always.\n\n\n \"Oh God,\" I moaned, \"what shall I do?\" Next morning the door chimes pealed, and you went to the door and  brought back the audiogram. It was addressed to me; I wondered who  could be sending me a message.\n\n\n I pressed the stud on the little gray cylinder, and a rasping,  automatic voice droned: \"Luna City, Luna, July 27, 1995. Regret to  inform you of death of Charles Taggart, Chief Jetman....\"\n\n\n Then there was a Latin name which was more polite than the word  \"lung-rot\" and the metallic phrase, \"This message brought to you by  courtesy of United Nations Earth-Luna Communication Corps.\"\n\n\n I stood staring at the cylinder.\n\n\n Charles Taggart was dead.\n\n\n Charles Taggart was Charlie. Stardust Charlie.\n\n\n My heart thudded crazily against my chest. It couldn't be! Not Charlie!  The audiogram had lied!\n\n\n I pressed the stud again. \"... regret to inform you of death of  Charles ...\"\n\n\n I hurled the cylinder at the wall. It thudded, fell, rolled. The broken  voice droned on.\n\n\n You ran to it, shut it off. \"I'm sorry, Ben, so terribly\u2014\"\n\n\n Without answering, I walked into my room. I knew it was true now. I  remembered Charlie's coughing, his gaunt features, his drugged gaze.  The metallic words had told the truth.\n\n\n I sat for a long time on my bed, crying inside, but staring dry-eyed at  Charlie's faded tin box.\n\n\n Then, finally, I fingered his meager possessions\u2014a few wrinkled  photos, some letters, a small black statue of a forgotten Martian god,  a gold service medal from the Moon Patrol. This was what remained of Charlie after twenty-five years in space.  It was a bitter bargain. A statue instead of a wife, yellowed letters  instead of children, a medal instead of a home. It'd be a great future , I thought. You'd dream of sitting in a dingy  stone dive on the Grand Canal with sand-wasps buzzing around smoky,  stinking candles. A bottle of luchu juice and a couple of Martian girls  with dirty feet for company. And a sudden cough that would be the first  sign of lung-rot. To hell with it!\n\n\n I walked into your living room and called Dean Dawson on the visiphone.\n\n\n I accepted that job teaching. And now, Laura, it's nearly midnight. You're in your room, sleeping,  and the house is silent.\n\n\n It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am  writing this.\n\n\n I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading  the old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that  Charlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they  could tell me what he could not express in words.\n\n\n And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n\n\n A wedding ring.\n\n\n In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.  Charlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same  decision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to  travel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can be  no compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n\n\n Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he  could look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never  live to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He  left himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a  man's dream.\n\n\n He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven  knows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was  kind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\n\n\n Do you know why he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't  want to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n\n\n It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the  Universe, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,  brothers, the planets his children.\n\n\n You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes  after you reach it. But how can one ever be sure until the journey is  made? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a  star and think, I might have gone there; I could have been the first ?\n\n\n We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one  be lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n\n\n Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us  to celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his  last night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration  to you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n\n\n Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain  the best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n\n\n Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafe  on Mars, the Space Rat , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n\n\n Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever  part of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.\n\n\n I have two wedding rings with me\u2014his wife's ring and yours. ",

LUDWIG\n\n\n Illustrated by THORNE\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction October 1951.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] One man's retreat is another's prison ... and   it takes a heap of flying to make a hulk a home! Forty days of heaven and forty nights of hell. That's the way it's  been, Laura. But how can I make you understand? How can I tell you  what it's like to be young and a man and to dream of reaching the  stars? And yet, at the same time, to be filled with a terrible, gnawing  fear\u2014a fear locked in my mind during the day and bursting out like an  evil jack-in-the-box at night. I must tell you, Laura.\n\n\n Perhaps if I start at the beginning, the very beginning....\n\n\n It was the Big Day. All the examinations, the physicals and psychos,  were over. The Academy, with its great halls and classrooms and  laboratories, lay hollow and silent, an exhausted thing at sleep after  spawning its first-born.\n\n\n For it was June in this year of 1995, and we were the graduating class  of the U. S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight.\n\n\n The first graduating class, Laura. That's why it was so important,  because we were the first .\n\n\n We sat on a little platform, twenty-five of us. Below us was a beach  of faces, most of them strange, shining like pebbles in the warm New  Mexican sunlight. They were the faces of mothers and fathers and  grandparents and kid brothers and sisters\u2014the people who a short time  ago had been only scrawled names on letters from home or words spoken  wistfully at Christmas. They were the memory-people who, to me, had  never really existed.\n\n\n But today they had become real, and they were here and looking at us  with pride in their eyes.\n\n\n A voice was speaking, deep, sure, resonant. \"... these boys have worked  hard for six years, and now they're going to do a lot of big things.  They're going to bring us the metals and minerals that we desperately  need. They're going to find new land for our colonists, good rich land  that will bear food and be a home for our children. And perhaps most  important of all, they'll make other men think of the stars and look up  at them and feel humility\u2014for mankind needs humility.\"\n\n\n The speaker was Robert Chandler, who'd brought the first rocket down on  Mars just five years ago, who'd established the first colony there, and  who had just returned from his second hop to Venus.\n\n\n Instead of listening to his words, I was staring at his broad shoulders  and his dark, crew-cut hair and his white uniform which was silk-smooth  and skin-tight. I was worshiping him and hating him at the same time,  for I was thinking: He's already reached Mars and Venus. Let him leave Jupiter and the  others alone! Let us be the first to land somewhere! Let us be the  first! Mickey Cameron, sitting next to me, dug an elbow into my ribs. \"I don't  see 'em, Ben,\" he whispered. \"Where do you suppose they are?\"\n\n\n I blinked. \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"My folks.\"\n\n\n That was something I didn't have to worry about. My parents had died in  a strato-jet crash when I was four, so I hadn't needed many of those  \"You are cordially invited\" cards. Just one, which I'd sent to Charlie  Taggart.\n\n\n Stardust Charlie, we called him, although I never knew why. He was a  veteran of Everson's first trip to the Moon nearly twenty-five years  ago, and he was still at it. He was Chief Jetman now on the Lunar  Lady , a commercial ore ship on a shuttle between Luna City and White  Sands.\n\n\n I remembered how, as a kid, I'd pestered him in the Long Island  Spaceport, tagging after him like a puppy, and how he'd grown to like  me until he became father, mother, and buddy all in one to me. And I  remembered, too, how his recommendation had finally made me a cadet.\n\n\n My gaze wandered over the faces, but I couldn't find Charlie's. It  wasn't surprising. The Lunar Lady was in White Sands now, but  liberties, as Charlie said, were as scarce as water on Mars. It doesn't matter , I told myself.\n\n\n Then Mickey stiffened. \"I see 'em, Ben! There in the fifth row!\"\n\n\n Usually Mickey was the same whether in a furnace-hot engine room or a  garden party, smiling, accepting whatever the world offered. But now a  tenseness and an excitement had gripped even him. I was grateful that  he was beside me; we'd been a good team during those final months at  the Academy and I knew we'd be a good team in space. The Universe was  mighty big, but with two of us to face it together, it would be only  half as big.\n\n\n And then it seemed that all the proud faces were looking at us as if we  were gods. A shiver went through my body. Though it was daytime, I saw  the stars in my mind's vision, the great shining balls of silver, each  like a voice crying out and pleading to be explored, to be touched by  the sons of Earth. They expect a lot from us. They expect us to make a new kind of  civilization and a better place out of Earth. They expect all this and  a hell of a lot more. They think there's nothing we can't do. I felt very small and very humble. I was scared. Damned scared. At last it was over, and the proud faces descended upon us in a huge,  babbling wave.\n\n\n Then I saw him. Good old Stardust Charlie.\n\n\n His wizened little body was shuffling down an aisle, his eyes shining  like a child's. He'd been sandwiched, evidently, in one of the rear  rows.\n\n\n But he wasn't the Charlie I'd seen a year ago. He'd become gaunt and  old, and he walked with an unnatural stiffness. He looked so old that  it was hard to believe he'd once been young.\n\n\n He scratched his mop of steel-gray hair and grinned.\n\n\n \"You made it, boy,\" he chortled, \"and by Jupiter, we'll celebrate  tonight. Yes, siree, I got twenty-four hours, and we'll celebrate as  good spacemen should!\"\n\n\n Then Mickey strode up to us. He was his normal, boyish self again,  walking lightly, his blond, curly-haired skull swaying as if in rhythm  with some silent melody.\n\n\n And you, Laura, were with him.\n\n\n \"Meet the Brat,\" he said. \"My sister Laura.\"\n\n\n I stared almost rudely. You were like a doll lost in the immensity  of your fluffy pink dress. Your hair was long and transformed into a  golden froth where sunlight touched it. But your eyes were the eyes  of a woman, glowing like dark stars and reflecting a softness, a  gentleness that I'd never seen in eyes before.\n\n\n \"I'm happy to meet you, Ben,\" you said. \"I've heard of no one else for  the past year.\"\n\n\n A tide of heat crept up from my collar. I stuttered through an  introduction of Charlie.\n\n\n You and Mickey looked strangely at Charlie, and I realized that old  Stardust was not a cadet's notion of the ideal spaceman. Charlie  scorned the skin-tight uniforms of the government service and wore a  shiny black suit that was a relic of Everson's early-day Moon Patrol.  His tie was clumsily knotted, and a button on his coat was missing.\n\n\n And the left side of his face was streaked with dark scar tissue, the  result of an atomic blowup on one of the old Moon ships. I was so  accustomed to the scars, I was seldom aware of them; but others, I  knew, would find them ugly.\n\n\n You were kind. You shook hands and said, softly: \"It's a privilege to  meet you, Charlie. Just think\u2014one of Everson's men, one of the first  to reach the Moon!\"\n\n\n Charlie gulped helplessly, and Mickey said: \"Still going to spend the  weekend with us, aren't you, Ben?\"\n\n\n I shook my head. \"Charlie has only twenty-four hours liberty. We're  planning to see the town tonight.\"\n\n\n \"Why don't you both come with us?\" you asked. \"Our folks have their  own plane, so it would be no problem. And we've got a big guest room.  Charlie, wouldn't you like a home-cooked meal before going back to the  Moon?\"\n\n\n Charlie's answer was obscured by a sudden burst of coughing. I knew  that he'd infinitely prefer to spend his liberty sampling Martian  fizzes and Plutonian zombies.\n\n\n But this night seemed too sacred for Charlie's kind of celebration.\n\n\n \"We'd really like to come,\" I said. On our way to the 'copter parking field, Dean Dawson passed us. He was  a tall, willowy man, spectacled, looking the way an academy professor  should look.\n\n\n \"Ben,\" he called, \"don't forget that offer. Remember you've got two  months to decide.\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks,\" I answered. \"Better not count on me.\"\n\n\n A moment later Mickey said, frowning, \"What was he talking about, Ben?  Did he make you an offer?\"\n\n\n I laughed. \"He offered me a job here at the Academy teaching  astrogation. What a life that would be! Imagine standing in a  classroom for forty years when I've got the chance to\u2014\"\n\n\n I hesitated, and you supplied the right words: \"When you've got the  chance to be the first to reach a new planet. That's what most of you  want, isn't it? That's what Mickey used to want.\"\n\n\n I looked at you as if you were Everson himself, because you seemed to  understand the hunger that could lie in a man's heart.\n\n\n Then your last words came back and jabbed me: \"That's what Mickey used  to want.\"\n\n\n \" Used to want?\" I asked. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n You bit your lip, not answering.\n\n\n \"What did she mean, Mickey?\"\n\n\n Mickey looked down at his feet. \"I didn't want to tell you yet, Ben.  We've been together a long time, planning to be on a rocket. But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Yes?\"\n\n\n \"Well, what does it add up to? You become a spaceman and wear a pretty  uniform. You wade through the sands of Mars and the dust of Venus. If  you're lucky, you're good for five, maybe ten years. Then one thing or  another gets you. They don't insure rocketmen, you know.\"\n\n\n My stomach was full of churning, biting ice. \"What are you trying to  say, Mickey?\"\n\n\n \"I've thought about it a long time. They want me for Cargo Supervisor  of White Sands Port.\" He raised his hand to stop me. \"I know. It's not  so exciting. I'll just live a lot longer. I'm sorry, Ben.\"\n\n\n I couldn't answer. It was as if someone had whacked the back of my  knees with the blast of a jet.\n\n\n \"It doesn't change anything, Ben\u2014right now, I mean. We can still have  a good weekend.\"\n\n\n Charlie was muttering under his breath, smoldering like a bomb about to  reach critical mass. I shook my head dazedly at him as we got to the  'copter.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I said to Mickey, \"we can still have a good weekend.\" I liked your folks, Laura. There was no star-hunger in them, of course.  They were simple and solid and settled, like green growing things,  deep-rooted, belonging to Earth. They were content with a home that was  cool on this warm summer night, with a 'copter and a tri-dimensional  video, and a handsome automatic home that needed no servants or  housework.\n\n\n Stardust Charlie was as comfortable as a Martian sand-monkey in a  shower, but he tried courageously to be himself.\n\n\n At the dinner table he stared glassily at nothing and grated, \"Only hit  Mars once, but I'll never forget the kid who called himself a medic.  Skipper started coughing, kept it up for three days. Whoopin' cough,  the medic says, not knowin' the air had chemicals that turned to acid  in your lungs. I'd never been to Mars before, but I knew better'n that.  Hell, I says, that ain't whoopin' cough, that's lung-rot.\"\n\n\n That was when your father said he wasn't so hungry after all.\n\n\n Afterward, you and I walked onto the terrace, into the moonlit night,  to watch for crimson-tailed continental rockets that occasionally  streaked up from White Sands.\n\n\n We gazed for a few seconds up into the dark sky, and then you said:  \"Charlie is funny, isn't he? He's nice and I'm glad he's here, but he's  sort of funny.\"\n\n\n \"He's an old-time spaceman. You didn't need much education in those  days, just a lot of brawn and a quick mind. It took guts to be a  spaceman then.\"\n\n\n \"But he wasn't always a spaceman. Didn't he ever have a family?\"\n\n\n I smiled and shook my head. \"If he had, he never mentioned it. Charlie  doesn't like to be sentimental, at least not on the outside. As far as  I know, his life began when he took off for the Moon with Everson.\"\n\n\n You stared at me strangely, almost in a sacred kind of way. I knew  suddenly that you liked me, and my heart began to beat faster.\n\n\n There was silence.\n\n\n You were lovely, your soft hair like strands of gold, and there were  flecks of silver in your dark eyes. Somehow I was afraid. I had the  feeling that I shouldn't have come here.\n\n\n You kept looking at me until I had to ask: \"What are you thinking,  Laura?\"\n\n\n You laughed, but it was a sad, fearful laugh. \"No, I shouldn't be  thinking it. You'd hate me if I told you, and I wouldn't want that.\"\n\n\n \"I could never hate you.\"\n\n\n \"It\u2014it's about the stars,\" you said very softly. \"I understand why you  want to go to them. Mickey and I used to dream about them when we were  kids. Of course I was a girl, so it was just a game to me. But once I  dreamed of going to England. Oh, it was going to be so wonderful. I  lived for months, just thinking about it.\n\n\n \"One summer we went. I had fun. I saw the old buildings and castles,  and the spaceports and the Channel Tube. But after it was over, I  realized England wasn't so different from America. Places seem exciting  before you get to them, and afterward they're not really.\"\n\n\n I frowned. \"And you mean it might be the same with the stars? You think  maybe I haven't grown up yet?\"\n\n\n Anxiety darkened your features. \"No, it'd be good to be a spaceman,  to see the strange places and make history. But is it worth it? Is it  worth the things you'd have to give up?\"\n\n\n I didn't understand at first, and I wanted to ask, \"Give up what ?\"\n\n\n Then I looked at you and the promise in your eyes, and I knew.\n\n\n All through the years I'd been walking down a single, narrow path.\n\n\n Government boarding school, the Academy, my eyes always upward and on  the stars.\n\n\n Now I'd stumbled into a cross-roads, beholding a strange new path that  I'd never noticed before. You can go into space , I thought, and try to do as much living in  ten years as normal men do in fifty. You can be like Everson, who died  in a Moon crash at the age of 36, or like a thousand others who lie  buried in Martian sand and Venusian dust. Or, if you're lucky, like  Charlie\u2014a kind of human meteor streaking through space, eternally  alone, never finding a home. Or there's the other path. To stay on this little prison of an Earth  in cool, comfortable houses. To be one of the solid, rooted people with  a wife and kids. To be one of the people who live long enough to grow  old, who awake to the song of birds instead of rocket grumblings, who  fill their lungs with the clean rich air of Earth instead of poisonous  dust. \"I'm sorry,\" you said. \"I didn't mean to make you sad, Ben.\"\n\n\n \"It's all right,\" I said, clenching my fists. \"You made sense\u2014a lot of  sense.\" The next morning Charlie said good-bye in our room. He rubbed his  scarred face nervously as he cleared his throat with a series of thin,  tight coughs.\n\n\n Then he pointed to a brown, faded tin box lying on the bed. \"I'm  leavin' that for you. It's full of old stuff, souvenirs mostly. Thought  maybe you'd like to have 'em.\"\n\n\n I scowled, not understanding. \"Why, Charlie? What for?\"\n\n\n He shrugged as if afraid he might be accused of sentimentality. \"Oh,  it's just that I've been dodgin' meteors now for twenty-five years.  That's a long time, boy. Ain't one spaceman in a thousand that lucky.  Some of these days, I won't be so lucky.\"\n\n\n I tried to laugh. \"You're good for another twenty-five years, Charlie.\"\n\n\n He shook his head stiffly, staring at nothing. \"Maybe. Anyway, I'm  gonna get off the Shuttle this time, make one more trip to Mars. Tell  you what. There's a little stone cafe on Mars, the Space Rat , just  off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal. When you get to Mars, take a  look inside. I'll probably be there.\"\n\n\n He coughed again, a deep, rasping cough that filled his eyes with tears.\n\n\n \"Not used to this Earth air,\" he muttered. \"What I need's some Martian  climate.\"\n\n\n Suddenly that cough frightened me. It didn't seem normal. I wondered,  too, about his stiff movements and glassy stare. It was as if he were  drugged.\n\n\n I shook the thought away. If Charlie was sick, he wouldn't talk about  going to Mars. The medics wouldn't let him go even as far as Luna.\n\n\n We watched him leave, you and Mickey and I.\n\n\n \"When will you be back?\" you asked.\n\n\n Charlie's hard face contorted itself into a gargoylish grin. \"Maybe a  couple of months, maybe a couple of years. You know spacemen.\"\n\n\n Then he waved and strode away, a strange, gray, withered gnome of a man.\n\n\n I wanted him to say something, to tell me the secret that would kill  the doubt worming through my brain.\n\n\n But he rounded a corner, still grinning and waving, and then he was  gone. That afternoon Mickey showed me his room. It was more like a boy's  room than a spaceman's. In it were all the little things that kids  treasure\u2014pennants, models of Everson's two ships, a tennis trophy,  books, a home-made video.\n\n\n I began to realize how important a room like this could be to a boy.  I could imagine, too, the happiness that parents felt as they watched  their children grow to adulthood.\n\n\n I'd missed something. My folks were shadow-people, my impressions of  them drawn half from ancient photos, half from imagination. For me, it  had been a cold, automatic kind of life, the life of dormitories and  routines and rules. I'd been so blinded by the brilliancy of my dreams,  I hadn't realized I was different. My folks were killed in a rocket crash. If it weren't for rockets, I'd  have lived the kind of life a kid should live. Mickey noticed my frown.\n\n\n \"What's the matter, Ben? Still sore? I feel like a heel, but I'm just  not like you and Charlie, I guess. I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No, I understand, Mickey. I'm not sore, really.\"\n\n\n \"Listen, then. You haven't accepted any offer yet, have you?\"\n\n\n \"No. I got a couple of possibilities. Could get a berth on the Odyssey , the new ship being finished at Los Angeles. They want me,  too, for the Moon Patrol, but that's old stuff, not much better than  teaching. I want to be in deep space.\"\n\n\n \"Well, how about staying with us till you decide? Might as well enjoy  Earth life while you can. Okay?\"\n\n\n I felt like running from the house, to forget that it existed. I wanted  someone to tell me one of the old stories about space, a tale of  courage that would put fuel on dying dreams.\n\n\n But I wanted, also, to be with you, Laura, to see your smile and the  flecks of silver in your eyes and the way your nose turned upward ever  so slightly when you laughed. You see, I loved you already, almost as  much as I loved the stars.\n\n\n And I said, slowly, my voice sounding unfamiliar and far away, \"Sure,  I'll stay, Mickey. Sure.\" Forty days of joy, forty nights of fear and indecision. We did all the  little things, like watching the rockets land at White Sands and flying  down to the Gulf to swim in cool waters. You tried, unsuccessfully, to  teach me to dance, and we talked about Everson and Charlie and the Moon  and the stars. You felt you had to give the stars all the beauty and  promise of a child's dream, because you knew that was what I wanted.\n\n\n One morning I thought, Why must I make a choice? Why can't I have both  you and the stars? Would that be asking too much? All day the thought lay in my mind like fire.\n\n\n That evening I asked you to marry me. I said it very simply: \"Laura, I  want you to be my wife.\"\n\n\n You looked up at Venus, and you were silent for a long while, your face  flushed.\n\n\n Then you murmured, \"I\u2014I want to marry you, Ben, but are you asking me  to marry a spaceman or a teacher?\"\n\n\n \"Can't a spaceman marry, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, a spaceman can marry, but what would it be like? Don't you see,  Ben? You'd be like Charlie. Gone for maybe two months, maybe two  years. Then you'd have a twenty-four hour liberty\u2014and I'd have what?\"\n\n\n Somehow I'd expected words like these, but still they hurt. \"I wouldn't  have to be a spaceman forever. I could try it for a couple of years,  then teach.\"\n\n\n \"Would you, Ben? Would you be satisfied with just seeing Mars? Wouldn't  you want to go on to Jupiter and Saturn and Uranus and on and on?\"\n\n\n Your voice was choked, and even in the semi-darkness I saw tears  glittering in your eyes.\n\n\n \"Do you think I'd dare have children, Ben? Mickey told me what happened  on the Cyclops . There was a leak in the atomic engines. The ship was  flooded with radiation\u2014just for a second. It didn't seem serious. The  men had no burns. But a year later the captain had a child. And it  was\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I know, Laura. Don't say it.\"\n\n\n You had to finish. \"It was a monster.\"\n\n\n That night I lay awake, the fears and doubts too frantic to let me  sleep. You've got to decide now , I told myself. You can't stay here. You've  got to make a choice. The teaching job was still open. The spot on the Odyssey was still  open\u2014and the big ship, it was rumored, was equipped to make it all the  way to Pluto. You can take Dean Dawson's job and stay with Laura and have kids and a  home and live to see what happens in this world sixty years from now. Or you can see what's on the other side of the mountain. You can be a  line in a history book. I cursed. I knew what Charlie would say. He'd say, \"Get the hell out  of there, boy. Don't let a fool woman make a sucker out of you. Get  out there on the Odyssey where you belong. We got a date on Mars,  remember? At the Space Rat , just off Chandler Field on the Grand  Canal.\"\n\n\n That's what he'd say.\n\n\n And yet I wanted you, Laura. I wanted to be with you, always.\n\n\n \"Oh God,\" I moaned, \"what shall I do?\" Next morning the door chimes pealed, and you went to the door and  brought back the audiogram. It was addressed to me; I wondered who  could be sending me a message.\n\n\n I pressed the stud on the little gray cylinder, and a rasping,  automatic voice droned: \"Luna City, Luna, July 27, 1995. Regret to  inform you of death of Charles Taggart, Chief Jetman....\"\n\n\n Then there was a Latin name which was more polite than the word  \"lung-rot\" and the metallic phrase, \"This message brought to you by  courtesy of United Nations Earth-Luna Communication Corps.\"\n\n\n I stood staring at the cylinder.\n\n\n Charles Taggart was dead.\n\n\n Charles Taggart was Charlie. Stardust Charlie.\n\n\n My heart thudded crazily against my chest. It couldn't be! Not Charlie!  The audiogram had lied!\n\n\n I pressed the stud again. \"... regret to inform you of death of  Charles ...\"\n\n\n I hurled the cylinder at the wall. It thudded, fell, rolled. The broken  voice droned on.\n\n\n You ran to it, shut it off. \"I'm sorry, Ben, so terribly\u2014\"\n\n\n Without answering, I walked into my room. I knew it was true now. I  remembered Charlie's coughing, his gaunt features, his drugged gaze.  The metallic words had told the truth.\n\n\n I sat for a long time on my bed, crying inside, but staring dry-eyed at  Charlie's faded tin box.\n\n\n Then, finally, I fingered his meager possessions\u2014a few wrinkled  photos, some letters, a small black statue of a forgotten Martian god,  a gold service medal from the Moon Patrol. This was what remained of Charlie after twenty-five years in space.  It was a bitter bargain. A statue instead of a wife, yellowed letters  instead of children, a medal instead of a home. It'd be a great future , I thought. You'd dream of sitting in a dingy  stone dive on the Grand Canal with sand-wasps buzzing around smoky,  stinking candles. A bottle of luchu juice and a couple of Martian girls  with dirty feet for company. And a sudden cough that would be the first  sign of lung-rot. To hell with it!\n\n\n I walked into your living room and called Dean Dawson on the visiphone.\n\n\n I accepted that job teaching. And now, Laura, it's nearly midnight. You're in your room, sleeping,  and the house is silent.\n\n\n It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am  writing this.\n\n\n I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading  the old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that  Charlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they  could tell me what he could not express in words.\n\n\n And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n\n\n A wedding ring.\n\n\n In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.  Charlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same  decision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to  travel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can be  no compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n\n\n Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he  could look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never  live to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He  left himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a  man's dream.\n\n\n He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven  knows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was  kind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\n\n\n Do you know why he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't  want to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n\n\n It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the  Universe, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,  brothers, the planets his children.\n\n\n You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes  after you reach it. But how can one ever be sure until the journey is  made? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a  star and think, I might have gone there; I could have been the first ?\n\n\n We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one  be lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n\n\n Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us  to celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his  last night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration  to you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n\n\n Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain  the best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n\n\n Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafe  on Mars, the Space Rat , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n\n\n Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever  part of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.\n\n\n I have two wedding rings with me\u2014his wife's ring and yours. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat isn't a reason for Ben to want to be a rocketman?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"he wanted to be the best for Laura\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"he didn't have family to come home to\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"he didn't have family to come home to\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"he didn't have family to come home to\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

LUDWIG\n\n\n Illustrated by THORNE\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction October 1951.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] One man's retreat is another's prison ... and   it takes a heap of flying to make a hulk a home! Forty days of heaven and forty nights of hell. That's the way it's  been, Laura. But how can I make you understand? How can I tell you  what it's like to be young and a man and to dream of reaching the  stars? And yet, at the same time, to be filled with a terrible, gnawing  fear\u2014a fear locked in my mind during the day and bursting out like an  evil jack-in-the-box at night. I must tell you, Laura.\n\n\n Perhaps if I start at the beginning, the very beginning....\n\n\n It was the Big Day. All the examinations, the physicals and psychos,  were over. The Academy, with its great halls and classrooms and  laboratories, lay hollow and silent, an exhausted thing at sleep after  spawning its first-born.\n\n\n For it was June in this year of 1995, and we were the graduating class  of the U. S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight.\n\n\n The first graduating class, Laura. That's why it was so important,  because we were the first .\n\n\n We sat on a little platform, twenty-five of us. Below us was a beach  of faces, most of them strange, shining like pebbles in the warm New  Mexican sunlight. They were the faces of mothers and fathers and  grandparents and kid brothers and sisters\u2014the people who a short time  ago had been only scrawled names on letters from home or words spoken  wistfully at Christmas. They were the memory-people who, to me, had  never really existed.\n\n\n But today they had become real, and they were here and looking at us  with pride in their eyes.\n\n\n A voice was speaking, deep, sure, resonant. \"... these boys have worked  hard for six years, and now they're going to do a lot of big things.  They're going to bring us the metals and minerals that we desperately  need. They're going to find new land for our colonists, good rich land  that will bear food and be a home for our children. And perhaps most  important of all, they'll make other men think of the stars and look up  at them and feel humility\u2014for mankind needs humility.\"\n\n\n The speaker was Robert Chandler, who'd brought the first rocket down on  Mars just five years ago, who'd established the first colony there, and  who had just returned from his second hop to Venus.\n\n\n Instead of listening to his words, I was staring at his broad shoulders  and his dark, crew-cut hair and his white uniform which was silk-smooth  and skin-tight. I was worshiping him and hating him at the same time,  for I was thinking: He's already reached Mars and Venus. Let him leave Jupiter and the  others alone! Let us be the first to land somewhere! Let us be the  first! Mickey Cameron, sitting next to me, dug an elbow into my ribs. \"I don't  see 'em, Ben,\" he whispered. \"Where do you suppose they are?\"\n\n\n I blinked. \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"My folks.\"\n\n\n That was something I didn't have to worry about. My parents had died in  a strato-jet crash when I was four, so I hadn't needed many of those  \"You are cordially invited\" cards. Just one, which I'd sent to Charlie  Taggart.\n\n\n Stardust Charlie, we called him, although I never knew why. He was a  veteran of Everson's first trip to the Moon nearly twenty-five years  ago, and he was still at it. He was Chief Jetman now on the Lunar  Lady , a commercial ore ship on a shuttle between Luna City and White  Sands.\n\n\n I remembered how, as a kid, I'd pestered him in the Long Island  Spaceport, tagging after him like a puppy, and how he'd grown to like  me until he became father, mother, and buddy all in one to me. And I  remembered, too, how his recommendation had finally made me a cadet.\n\n\n My gaze wandered over the faces, but I couldn't find Charlie's. It  wasn't surprising. The Lunar Lady was in White Sands now, but  liberties, as Charlie said, were as scarce as water on Mars. It doesn't matter , I told myself.\n\n\n Then Mickey stiffened. \"I see 'em, Ben! There in the fifth row!\"\n\n\n Usually Mickey was the same whether in a furnace-hot engine room or a  garden party, smiling, accepting whatever the world offered. But now a  tenseness and an excitement had gripped even him. I was grateful that  he was beside me; we'd been a good team during those final months at  the Academy and I knew we'd be a good team in space. The Universe was  mighty big, but with two of us to face it together, it would be only  half as big.\n\n\n And then it seemed that all the proud faces were looking at us as if we  were gods. A shiver went through my body. Though it was daytime, I saw  the stars in my mind's vision, the great shining balls of silver, each  like a voice crying out and pleading to be explored, to be touched by  the sons of Earth. They expect a lot from us. They expect us to make a new kind of  civilization and a better place out of Earth. They expect all this and  a hell of a lot more. They think there's nothing we can't do. I felt very small and very humble. I was scared. Damned scared. At last it was over, and the proud faces descended upon us in a huge,  babbling wave.\n\n\n Then I saw him. Good old Stardust Charlie.\n\n\n His wizened little body was shuffling down an aisle, his eyes shining  like a child's. He'd been sandwiched, evidently, in one of the rear  rows.\n\n\n But he wasn't the Charlie I'd seen a year ago. He'd become gaunt and  old, and he walked with an unnatural stiffness. He looked so old that  it was hard to believe he'd once been young.\n\n\n He scratched his mop of steel-gray hair and grinned.\n\n\n \"You made it, boy,\" he chortled, \"and by Jupiter, we'll celebrate  tonight. Yes, siree, I got twenty-four hours, and we'll celebrate as  good spacemen should!\"\n\n\n Then Mickey strode up to us. He was his normal, boyish self again,  walking lightly, his blond, curly-haired skull swaying as if in rhythm  with some silent melody.\n\n\n And you, Laura, were with him.\n\n\n \"Meet the Brat,\" he said. \"My sister Laura.\"\n\n\n I stared almost rudely. You were like a doll lost in the immensity  of your fluffy pink dress. Your hair was long and transformed into a  golden froth where sunlight touched it. But your eyes were the eyes  of a woman, glowing like dark stars and reflecting a softness, a  gentleness that I'd never seen in eyes before.\n\n\n \"I'm happy to meet you, Ben,\" you said. \"I've heard of no one else for  the past year.\"\n\n\n A tide of heat crept up from my collar. I stuttered through an  introduction of Charlie.\n\n\n You and Mickey looked strangely at Charlie, and I realized that old  Stardust was not a cadet's notion of the ideal spaceman. Charlie  scorned the skin-tight uniforms of the government service and wore a  shiny black suit that was a relic of Everson's early-day Moon Patrol.  His tie was clumsily knotted, and a button on his coat was missing.\n\n\n And the left side of his face was streaked with dark scar tissue, the  result of an atomic blowup on one of the old Moon ships. I was so  accustomed to the scars, I was seldom aware of them; but others, I  knew, would find them ugly.\n\n\n You were kind. You shook hands and said, softly: \"It's a privilege to  meet you, Charlie. Just think\u2014one of Everson's men, one of the first  to reach the Moon!\"\n\n\n Charlie gulped helplessly, and Mickey said: \"Still going to spend the  weekend with us, aren't you, Ben?\"\n\n\n I shook my head. \"Charlie has only twenty-four hours liberty. We're  planning to see the town tonight.\"\n\n\n \"Why don't you both come with us?\" you asked. \"Our folks have their  own plane, so it would be no problem. And we've got a big guest room.  Charlie, wouldn't you like a home-cooked meal before going back to the  Moon?\"\n\n\n Charlie's answer was obscured by a sudden burst of coughing. I knew  that he'd infinitely prefer to spend his liberty sampling Martian  fizzes and Plutonian zombies.\n\n\n But this night seemed too sacred for Charlie's kind of celebration.\n\n\n \"We'd really like to come,\" I said. On our way to the 'copter parking field, Dean Dawson passed us. He was  a tall, willowy man, spectacled, looking the way an academy professor  should look.\n\n\n \"Ben,\" he called, \"don't forget that offer. Remember you've got two  months to decide.\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks,\" I answered. \"Better not count on me.\"\n\n\n A moment later Mickey said, frowning, \"What was he talking about, Ben?  Did he make you an offer?\"\n\n\n I laughed. \"He offered me a job here at the Academy teaching  astrogation. What a life that would be! Imagine standing in a  classroom for forty years when I've got the chance to\u2014\"\n\n\n I hesitated, and you supplied the right words: \"When you've got the  chance to be the first to reach a new planet. That's what most of you  want, isn't it? That's what Mickey used to want.\"\n\n\n I looked at you as if you were Everson himself, because you seemed to  understand the hunger that could lie in a man's heart.\n\n\n Then your last words came back and jabbed me: \"That's what Mickey used  to want.\"\n\n\n \" Used to want?\" I asked. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n You bit your lip, not answering.\n\n\n \"What did she mean, Mickey?\"\n\n\n Mickey looked down at his feet. \"I didn't want to tell you yet, Ben.  We've been together a long time, planning to be on a rocket. But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Yes?\"\n\n\n \"Well, what does it add up to? You become a spaceman and wear a pretty  uniform. You wade through the sands of Mars and the dust of Venus. If  you're lucky, you're good for five, maybe ten years. Then one thing or  another gets you. They don't insure rocketmen, you know.\"\n\n\n My stomach was full of churning, biting ice. \"What are you trying to  say, Mickey?\"\n\n\n \"I've thought about it a long time. They want me for Cargo Supervisor  of White Sands Port.\" He raised his hand to stop me. \"I know. It's not  so exciting. I'll just live a lot longer. I'm sorry, Ben.\"\n\n\n I couldn't answer. It was as if someone had whacked the back of my  knees with the blast of a jet.\n\n\n \"It doesn't change anything, Ben\u2014right now, I mean. We can still have  a good weekend.\"\n\n\n Charlie was muttering under his breath, smoldering like a bomb about to  reach critical mass. I shook my head dazedly at him as we got to the  'copter.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I said to Mickey, \"we can still have a good weekend.\" I liked your folks, Laura. There was no star-hunger in them, of course.  They were simple and solid and settled, like green growing things,  deep-rooted, belonging to Earth. They were content with a home that was  cool on this warm summer night, with a 'copter and a tri-dimensional  video, and a handsome automatic home that needed no servants or  housework.\n\n\n Stardust Charlie was as comfortable as a Martian sand-monkey in a  shower, but he tried courageously to be himself.\n\n\n At the dinner table he stared glassily at nothing and grated, \"Only hit  Mars once, but I'll never forget the kid who called himself a medic.  Skipper started coughing, kept it up for three days. Whoopin' cough,  the medic says, not knowin' the air had chemicals that turned to acid  in your lungs. I'd never been to Mars before, but I knew better'n that.  Hell, I says, that ain't whoopin' cough, that's lung-rot.\"\n\n\n That was when your father said he wasn't so hungry after all.\n\n\n Afterward, you and I walked onto the terrace, into the moonlit night,  to watch for crimson-tailed continental rockets that occasionally  streaked up from White Sands.\n\n\n We gazed for a few seconds up into the dark sky, and then you said:  \"Charlie is funny, isn't he? He's nice and I'm glad he's here, but he's  sort of funny.\"\n\n\n \"He's an old-time spaceman. You didn't need much education in those  days, just a lot of brawn and a quick mind. It took guts to be a  spaceman then.\"\n\n\n \"But he wasn't always a spaceman. Didn't he ever have a family?\"\n\n\n I smiled and shook my head. \"If he had, he never mentioned it. Charlie  doesn't like to be sentimental, at least not on the outside. As far as  I know, his life began when he took off for the Moon with Everson.\"\n\n\n You stared at me strangely, almost in a sacred kind of way. I knew  suddenly that you liked me, and my heart began to beat faster.\n\n\n There was silence.\n\n\n You were lovely, your soft hair like strands of gold, and there were  flecks of silver in your dark eyes. Somehow I was afraid. I had the  feeling that I shouldn't have come here.\n\n\n You kept looking at me until I had to ask: \"What are you thinking,  Laura?\"\n\n\n You laughed, but it was a sad, fearful laugh. \"No, I shouldn't be  thinking it. You'd hate me if I told you, and I wouldn't want that.\"\n\n\n \"I could never hate you.\"\n\n\n \"It\u2014it's about the stars,\" you said very softly. \"I understand why you  want to go to them. Mickey and I used to dream about them when we were  kids. Of course I was a girl, so it was just a game to me. But once I  dreamed of going to England. Oh, it was going to be so wonderful. I  lived for months, just thinking about it.\n\n\n \"One summer we went. I had fun. I saw the old buildings and castles,  and the spaceports and the Channel Tube. But after it was over, I  realized England wasn't so different from America. Places seem exciting  before you get to them, and afterward they're not really.\"\n\n\n I frowned. \"And you mean it might be the same with the stars? You think  maybe I haven't grown up yet?\"\n\n\n Anxiety darkened your features. \"No, it'd be good to be a spaceman,  to see the strange places and make history. But is it worth it? Is it  worth the things you'd have to give up?\"\n\n\n I didn't understand at first, and I wanted to ask, \"Give up what ?\"\n\n\n Then I looked at you and the promise in your eyes, and I knew.\n\n\n All through the years I'd been walking down a single, narrow path.\n\n\n Government boarding school, the Academy, my eyes always upward and on  the stars.\n\n\n Now I'd stumbled into a cross-roads, beholding a strange new path that  I'd never noticed before. You can go into space , I thought, and try to do as much living in  ten years as normal men do in fifty. You can be like Everson, who died  in a Moon crash at the age of 36, or like a thousand others who lie  buried in Martian sand and Venusian dust. Or, if you're lucky, like  Charlie\u2014a kind of human meteor streaking through space, eternally  alone, never finding a home. Or there's the other path. To stay on this little prison of an Earth  in cool, comfortable houses. To be one of the solid, rooted people with  a wife and kids. To be one of the people who live long enough to grow  old, who awake to the song of birds instead of rocket grumblings, who  fill their lungs with the clean rich air of Earth instead of poisonous  dust. \"I'm sorry,\" you said. \"I didn't mean to make you sad, Ben.\"\n\n\n \"It's all right,\" I said, clenching my fists. \"You made sense\u2014a lot of  sense.\" The next morning Charlie said good-bye in our room. He rubbed his  scarred face nervously as he cleared his throat with a series of thin,  tight coughs.\n\n\n Then he pointed to a brown, faded tin box lying on the bed. \"I'm  leavin' that for you. It's full of old stuff, souvenirs mostly. Thought  maybe you'd like to have 'em.\"\n\n\n I scowled, not understanding. \"Why, Charlie? What for?\"\n\n\n He shrugged as if afraid he might be accused of sentimentality. \"Oh,  it's just that I've been dodgin' meteors now for twenty-five years.  That's a long time, boy. Ain't one spaceman in a thousand that lucky.  Some of these days, I won't be so lucky.\"\n\n\n I tried to laugh. \"You're good for another twenty-five years, Charlie.\"\n\n\n He shook his head stiffly, staring at nothing. \"Maybe. Anyway, I'm  gonna get off the Shuttle this time, make one more trip to Mars. Tell  you what. There's a little stone cafe on Mars, the Space Rat , just  off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal. When you get to Mars, take a  look inside. I'll probably be there.\"\n\n\n He coughed again, a deep, rasping cough that filled his eyes with tears.\n\n\n \"Not used to this Earth air,\" he muttered. \"What I need's some Martian  climate.\"\n\n\n Suddenly that cough frightened me. It didn't seem normal. I wondered,  too, about his stiff movements and glassy stare. It was as if he were  drugged.\n\n\n I shook the thought away. If Charlie was sick, he wouldn't talk about  going to Mars. The medics wouldn't let him go even as far as Luna.\n\n\n We watched him leave, you and Mickey and I.\n\n\n \"When will you be back?\" you asked.\n\n\n Charlie's hard face contorted itself into a gargoylish grin. \"Maybe a  couple of months, maybe a couple of years. You know spacemen.\"\n\n\n Then he waved and strode away, a strange, gray, withered gnome of a man.\n\n\n I wanted him to say something, to tell me the secret that would kill  the doubt worming through my brain.\n\n\n But he rounded a corner, still grinning and waving, and then he was  gone. That afternoon Mickey showed me his room. It was more like a boy's  room than a spaceman's. In it were all the little things that kids  treasure\u2014pennants, models of Everson's two ships, a tennis trophy,  books, a home-made video.\n\n\n I began to realize how important a room like this could be to a boy.  I could imagine, too, the happiness that parents felt as they watched  their children grow to adulthood.\n\n\n I'd missed something. My folks were shadow-people, my impressions of  them drawn half from ancient photos, half from imagination. For me, it  had been a cold, automatic kind of life, the life of dormitories and  routines and rules. I'd been so blinded by the brilliancy of my dreams,  I hadn't realized I was different. My folks were killed in a rocket crash. If it weren't for rockets, I'd  have lived the kind of life a kid should live. Mickey noticed my frown.\n\n\n \"What's the matter, Ben? Still sore? I feel like a heel, but I'm just  not like you and Charlie, I guess. I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No, I understand, Mickey. I'm not sore, really.\"\n\n\n \"Listen, then. You haven't accepted any offer yet, have you?\"\n\n\n \"No. I got a couple of possibilities. Could get a berth on the Odyssey , the new ship being finished at Los Angeles. They want me,  too, for the Moon Patrol, but that's old stuff, not much better than  teaching. I want to be in deep space.\"\n\n\n \"Well, how about staying with us till you decide? Might as well enjoy  Earth life while you can. Okay?\"\n\n\n I felt like running from the house, to forget that it existed. I wanted  someone to tell me one of the old stories about space, a tale of  courage that would put fuel on dying dreams.\n\n\n But I wanted, also, to be with you, Laura, to see your smile and the  flecks of silver in your eyes and the way your nose turned upward ever  so slightly when you laughed. You see, I loved you already, almost as  much as I loved the stars.\n\n\n And I said, slowly, my voice sounding unfamiliar and far away, \"Sure,  I'll stay, Mickey. Sure.\" Forty days of joy, forty nights of fear and indecision. We did all the  little things, like watching the rockets land at White Sands and flying  down to the Gulf to swim in cool waters. You tried, unsuccessfully, to  teach me to dance, and we talked about Everson and Charlie and the Moon  and the stars. You felt you had to give the stars all the beauty and  promise of a child's dream, because you knew that was what I wanted.\n\n\n One morning I thought, Why must I make a choice? Why can't I have both  you and the stars? Would that be asking too much? All day the thought lay in my mind like fire.\n\n\n That evening I asked you to marry me. I said it very simply: \"Laura, I  want you to be my wife.\"\n\n\n You looked up at Venus, and you were silent for a long while, your face  flushed.\n\n\n Then you murmured, \"I\u2014I want to marry you, Ben, but are you asking me  to marry a spaceman or a teacher?\"\n\n\n \"Can't a spaceman marry, too?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, a spaceman can marry, but what would it be like? Don't you see,  Ben? You'd be like Charlie. Gone for maybe two months, maybe two  years. Then you'd have a twenty-four hour liberty\u2014and I'd have what?\"\n\n\n Somehow I'd expected words like these, but still they hurt. \"I wouldn't  have to be a spaceman forever. I could try it for a couple of years,  then teach.\"\n\n\n \"Would you, Ben? Would you be satisfied with just seeing Mars? Wouldn't  you want to go on to Jupiter and Saturn and Uranus and on and on?\"\n\n\n Your voice was choked, and even in the semi-darkness I saw tears  glittering in your eyes.\n\n\n \"Do you think I'd dare have children, Ben? Mickey told me what happened  on the Cyclops . There was a leak in the atomic engines. The ship was  flooded with radiation\u2014just for a second. It didn't seem serious. The  men had no burns. But a year later the captain had a child. And it  was\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I know, Laura. Don't say it.\"\n\n\n You had to finish. \"It was a monster.\"\n\n\n That night I lay awake, the fears and doubts too frantic to let me  sleep. You've got to decide now , I told myself. You can't stay here. You've  got to make a choice. The teaching job was still open. The spot on the Odyssey was still  open\u2014and the big ship, it was rumored, was equipped to make it all the  way to Pluto. You can take Dean Dawson's job and stay with Laura and have kids and a  home and live to see what happens in this world sixty years from now. Or you can see what's on the other side of the mountain. You can be a  line in a history book. I cursed. I knew what Charlie would say. He'd say, \"Get the hell out  of there, boy. Don't let a fool woman make a sucker out of you. Get  out there on the Odyssey where you belong. We got a date on Mars,  remember? At the Space Rat , just off Chandler Field on the Grand  Canal.\"\n\n\n That's what he'd say.\n\n\n And yet I wanted you, Laura. I wanted to be with you, always.\n\n\n \"Oh God,\" I moaned, \"what shall I do?\" Next morning the door chimes pealed, and you went to the door and  brought back the audiogram. It was addressed to me; I wondered who  could be sending me a message.\n\n\n I pressed the stud on the little gray cylinder, and a rasping,  automatic voice droned: \"Luna City, Luna, July 27, 1995. Regret to  inform you of death of Charles Taggart, Chief Jetman....\"\n\n\n Then there was a Latin name which was more polite than the word  \"lung-rot\" and the metallic phrase, \"This message brought to you by  courtesy of United Nations Earth-Luna Communication Corps.\"\n\n\n I stood staring at the cylinder.\n\n\n Charles Taggart was dead.\n\n\n Charles Taggart was Charlie. Stardust Charlie.\n\n\n My heart thudded crazily against my chest. It couldn't be! Not Charlie!  The audiogram had lied!\n\n\n I pressed the stud again. \"... regret to inform you of death of  Charles ...\"\n\n\n I hurled the cylinder at the wall. It thudded, fell, rolled. The broken  voice droned on.\n\n\n You ran to it, shut it off. \"I'm sorry, Ben, so terribly\u2014\"\n\n\n Without answering, I walked into my room. I knew it was true now. I  remembered Charlie's coughing, his gaunt features, his drugged gaze.  The metallic words had told the truth.\n\n\n I sat for a long time on my bed, crying inside, but staring dry-eyed at  Charlie's faded tin box.\n\n\n Then, finally, I fingered his meager possessions\u2014a few wrinkled  photos, some letters, a small black statue of a forgotten Martian god,  a gold service medal from the Moon Patrol. This was what remained of Charlie after twenty-five years in space.  It was a bitter bargain. A statue instead of a wife, yellowed letters  instead of children, a medal instead of a home. It'd be a great future , I thought. You'd dream of sitting in a dingy  stone dive on the Grand Canal with sand-wasps buzzing around smoky,  stinking candles. A bottle of luchu juice and a couple of Martian girls  with dirty feet for company. And a sudden cough that would be the first  sign of lung-rot. To hell with it!\n\n\n I walked into your living room and called Dean Dawson on the visiphone.\n\n\n I accepted that job teaching. And now, Laura, it's nearly midnight. You're in your room, sleeping,  and the house is silent.\n\n\n It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am  writing this.\n\n\n I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading  the old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that  Charlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they  could tell me what he could not express in words.\n\n\n And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n\n\n A wedding ring.\n\n\n In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.  Charlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same  decision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to  travel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can be  no compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n\n\n Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he  could look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never  live to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He  left himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a  man's dream.\n\n\n He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven  knows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was  kind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\n\n\n Do you know why he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't  want to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n\n\n It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the  Universe, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,  brothers, the planets his children.\n\n\n You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes  after you reach it. But how can one ever be sure until the journey is  made? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a  star and think, I might have gone there; I could have been the first ?\n\n\n We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one  be lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n\n\n Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us  to celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his  last night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration  to you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n\n\n Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain  the best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n\n\n Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafe  on Mars, the Space Rat , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n\n\n Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever  part of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.\n\n\n I have two wedding rings with me\u2014his wife's ring and yours. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat isn't a reason for Ben to want to be a rocketman?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"he wanted to be the best for Laura\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"he didn't have family to come home to\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"he didn't have family to come home to\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"he didn't have family to come home to\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
