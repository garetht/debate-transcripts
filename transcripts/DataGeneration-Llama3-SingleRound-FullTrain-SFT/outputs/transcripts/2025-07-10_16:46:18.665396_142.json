Something  much the same can be said of the gunman, too.... GUN FOR HIRE By MACK\n\n REYNOLDS Joe Prantera  called  softly, \"Al.\" The pleasurable,  comfortable,  warm feeling began  spreading over him, the  way it always did.\n\n\n The older man stopped and  squinted, but not suspiciously, even  now.\n\n\n The evening was dark, it was unlikely  that the other even saw the  circle of steel that was the mouth of  the shotgun barrel, now resting on  the car's window ledge.\n\n\n \"Who's it?\" he growled.\n\n\n Joe Prantera said softly, \"Big Louis  sent me, Al.\"\n\n\n And he pressed the trigger.\n\n\n And at that moment, the universe  caved inward upon Joseph Marie  Prantera.\n\n\n There was nausea and nausea upon  nausea.\n\n\n There was a falling through all  space and through all time. There was  doubling and twisting and twitching  of every muscle and nerve.\n\n\n There was pain, horror and tumultuous  fear.\n\n\n And he came out of it as quickly  and completely as he'd gone in.\n\n\n He was in, he thought, a hospital  and his first reaction was to think, This here California. Everything different. Then his second thought was Something went wrong. Big Louis, he  ain't going to like this. He brought his thinking to the  present. So far as he could remember,  he hadn't completely pulled the trigger.  That at least meant that whatever  the rap was it wouldn't be too  tough. With luck, the syndicate would  get him off with a couple of years at  Quentin.\n\n\n A door slid open in the wall in a  way that Joe had never seen a door  operate before. This here California. The clothes on the newcomer were  wrong, too. For the first time, Joe  Prantera began to sense an alienness\u2014a  something that was awfully  wrong.\n\n\n The other spoke precisely and  slowly, the way a highly educated man  speaks a language which he reads  and writes fluently but has little occasion  to practice vocally. \"You have recovered?\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera looked at the other  expressionlessly. Maybe the old duck  was one of these foreign doctors, like.\n\n\n The newcomer said, \"You have undoubtedly  been through a most harrowing  experience. If you have any  untoward symptoms, possibly I could  be of assistance.\"\n\n\n Joe couldn't figure out how he  stood. For one thing, there should  have been some kind of police guard.\n\n\n The other said, \"Perhaps a bit of  stimulant?\"\n\n\n Joe said flatly, \"I wanta lawyer.\"\n\n\n The newcomer frowned at him. \"A  lawyer?\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sayin' nothin'. Not until I  get a mouthpiece.\"\n\n\n The newcomer started off on another  tack. \"My name is Lawrence  Reston-Farrell. If I am not mistaken,  you are Joseph Salviati-Prantera.\"\n\n\n Salviati happened to be Joe's mother's  maiden name. But it was unlikely  this character could have known that.  Joe had been born in Naples and his  mother had died in childbirth. His  father hadn't brought him to the  States until the age of five and by that  time he had a stepmother.\n\n\n \"I wanta mouthpiece,\" Joe said  flatly, \"or let me outta here.\"\n\n\n Lawrence Reston-Farrell said, \"You  are not being constrained. There are  clothes for you in the closet there.\"\n\n\n Joe gingerly tried swinging his  feet to the floor and sitting up, while  the other stood watching him, strangely.  He came to his feet. With the exception  of a faint nausea, which  brought back memories of that extreme  condition he'd suffered during  ... during what? He hadn't the  vaguest idea of what had happened.\n\n\n He was dressed in a hospital-type  nightgown. He looked down at it and  snorted and made his way over to the  closet. It opened on his approach, the  door sliding back into the wall in  much the same manner as the room's  door had opened for Reston-Farrell.\n\n\n Joe Prantera scowled and said,  \"These ain't my clothes.\"\n\n\n \"No, I am afraid not.\"\n\n\n \"You think I'd be seen dead wearing  this stuff? What is this, some religious  crackpot hospital?\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"I am afraid,  Mr. Salviati-Prantera, that these are  the only garments available. I suggest  you look out the window there.\"\n\n\n Joe gave him a long, chill look  and then stepped to the window. He  couldn't figure the other. Unless he  was a fruitcake. Maybe he was in  some kind of pressure cooker and  this was one of the fruitcakes.\n\n\n He looked out, however, not on the  lawns and walks of a sanitarium but  upon a wide boulevard of what was  obviously a populous city.\n\n\n And for a moment again, Joe Prantera  felt the depths of nausea.\n\n\n This was not his world.\n\n\n He stared for a long, long moment.  The cars didn't even have wheels, he  noted dully. He turned slowly and  faced the older man.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said compassionately,  \"Try this, it's excellent cognac.\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera stared at him, said finally,  flatly, \"What's it all about?\"\n\n\n The other put down the unaccepted  glass. \"We were afraid first  realization would be a shock to you,\"  he said. \"My colleague is in the adjoining  room. We will be glad to explain  to you if you will join us there.\"\n\n\n \"I wanta get out of here,\" Joe said.\n\n\n \"Where would you go?\"\n\n\n The fear of police, of Al Rossi's  vengeance, of the measures that  might be taken by Big Louis on his  failure, were now far away.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell had approached the  door by which he had entered and it  reopened for him. He went through  it without looking back.\n\n\n There was nothing else to do. Joe  dressed, then followed him. In the adjoining room was a circular  table that would have accommodated  a dozen persons. Two were  seated there now, papers, books and  soiled coffee cups before them. There  had evidently been a long wait.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell, the one Joe had already  met, was tall and drawn of face  and with a chainsmoker's nervousness.  The other was heavier and more  at ease. They were both, Joe estimated,  somewhere in their middle fifties.  They both looked like docs. He  wondered, all over again, if this was  some kind of pressure cooker.\n\n\n But that didn't explain the view  from the window.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"May I present  my colleague, Citizen Warren Brett-James?  Warren, this is our guest from  ... from yesteryear, Mr. Joseph Salviati-Prantera.\"\n\n\n Brett-James nodded to him, friendly,  so far as Joe could see. He said  gently, \"I think it would be Mr. Joseph  Prantera, wouldn't it? The maternal  linage was almost universally  ignored.\" His voice too gave the impression  he was speaking a language  not usually on his tongue.\n\n\n Joe took an empty chair, hardly  bothering to note its alien qualities.  His body seemed to fit into the piece  of furniture, as though it had been  molded to his order.\n\n\n Joe said, \"I think maybe I'll take  that there drink, Doc.\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"Of course,\"  and then something else Joe didn't  get. Whatever the something else  was, a slot opened in the middle of  the table and a glass, so clear of texture  as to be all but invisible, was  elevated. It contained possibly three  ounces of golden fluid.\n\n\n Joe didn't allow himself to think  of its means of delivery. He took up  the drink and bolted it. He put the  glass down and said carefully,  \"What's it all about, huh?\"\n\n\n Warren Brett-James said soothingly,  \"Prepare yourself for somewhat  of a shock, Mr. Prantera. You are no  longer in Los Angeles\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Ya think I'm stupid? I can see  that.\"\n\n\n \"I was about to say, Los Angeles of  1960. Mr. Prantera, we welcome you  to Nuevo Los Angeles.\"\n\n\n \"Ta where?\"\n\n\n \"To Nuevo Los Angeles and to  the year\u2014\" Brett-James looked at his  companion. \"What is the date, Old  Calendar?\"\n\n\n \"2133,\" Reston-Farrell said. \"2133  A.D. they would say.\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera looked from one of  them to the other, scowling. \"What  are you guys talking about?\"\n\n\n Warren Brett-James said softly,  \"Mr. Prantera, you are no longer in  the year 1960, you are now in the  year 2133.\"\n\n\n He said, uncomprehendingly, \"You  mean I been, like, unconscious for\u2014\"  He let the sentence fall away as he  realized the impossibility.\n\n\n Brett-James said gently, \"Hardly  for one hundred and seventy years,  Mr. Prantera.\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"I am afraid we  are confusing you. Briefly, we have transported you, I suppose one might  say, from your own era to ours.\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera had never been exposed  to the concept of time travel.  He had simply never associated with  anyone who had ever even remotely  considered such an idea. Now he said,  \"You mean, like, I been asleep all  that time?\"\n\n\n \"Not exactly,\" Brett-James said,  frowning.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"Suffice to say,  you are now one hundred and seventy-three  years after the last memory you  have.\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera's mind suddenly reverted  to those last memories and his  eyes narrowed dangerously. He felt  suddenly at bay. He said, \"Maybe  you guys better let me in on what's  this all about.\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"Mr. Prantera,  we have brought you from your era  to perform a task for us.\"\n\n\n Joe stared at him, and then at the  other. He couldn't believe he was getting  through to them. Or, at least,  that they were to him.\n\n\n Finally he said, \"If I get this, you  want me to do a job for you.\"\n\n\n \"That is correct.\"\n\n\n Joe said, \"You guys know the kind  of jobs I do?\"\n\n\n \"That is correct.\"\n\n\n \"Like hell you do. You think I'm  stupid? I never even seen you before.\"  Joe Prantera came abruptly to  his feet. \"I'm gettin' outta here.\"\n\n\n For the second time, Reston-Farrell  said, \"Where would you go, Mr.  Prantera?\"\n\n\n Joe glared at him. Then sat down  again, as abruptly as he'd arisen. \"Let's start all over again. I got this  straight, you brought me, some  screwy way, all the way ... here.  O.K., I'll buy that. I seen what it looks  like out that window\u2014\" The real  comprehension was seeping through  to him even as he talked. \"Everybody  I know, Jessie, Tony, the Kid, Big  Louis, everybody, they're dead. Even  Big Louis.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Brett-James said, his voice  soft. \"They are all dead, Mr. Prantera.  Their children are all dead, and their  grandchildren.\"\n\n\n The two men of the future said  nothing more for long minutes while  Joe Prantera's mind whirled its confusion.\n\n\n Finally he said, \"What's this bit  about you wanting me to give it to  some guy.\"\n\n\n \"That is why we brought you here,  Mr. Prantera. You were ... you  are, a professional assassin.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, wait a minute, now.\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell went on, ignoring  the interruption. \"There is small  point in denying your calling. Pray  remember that at the point when we  ... transported you, you were about  to dispose of a contemporary named  Alphonso Annunziata-Rossi. A citizen,  I might say, whose demise would  probably have caused small dismay to  society.\"\n\n\n They had him pegged all right. Joe  said, \"But why me? Why don't you  get some heavy from now? Somebody  knows the ropes these days.\"\n\n\n Brett-James said, \"Mr. Prantera,  there are no professional assassins in  this age, nor have there been for over  a century and a half.\"\n\n\n \"Well, then do it yourself.\" Joe  Prantera's irritation over this whole  complicated mess was growing. And  already he was beginning to long for  the things he knew\u2014for Jessie and  Tony and the others, for his favorite  bar, for the lasagne down at Papa  Giovanni's. Right now he could have  welcomed a calling down at the hands  of Big Louis.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell had come to his feet  and walked to one of the large room's  windows. He looked out, as though  unseeing. Then, his back turned, he  said, \"We have tried, but it is simply  not in us, Mr. Prantera.\"\n\n\n \"You mean you're yella?\"\n\n\n \"No, if by that you mean afraid. It  is simply not within us to take the  life of a fellow creature\u2014not to speak  of a fellow man.\"\n\n\n Joe snapped: \"Everything you guys  say sounds crazy. Let's start all over  again.\"\n\n\n Brett-James said, \"Let me do it,  Lawrence.\" He turned his eyes to Joe.  \"Mr. Prantera, in your own era, did  you ever consider the future?\"\n\n\n Joe looked at him blankly.\n\n\n \"In your day you were confronted  with national and international, problems.  Just as we are today and just as  nations were a century or a millennium  ago.\"\n\n\n \"Sure, O.K., so we had problems. I  know whatcha mean\u2014like wars, and  depressions and dictators and like  that.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, like that,\" Brett-James  nodded.\n\n\n The heavy-set man paused a moment.  \"Yes, like that,\" he repeated.  \"That we confront you now indicates  that the problems of your day were  solved. Hadn't they been, the world  most surely would have destroyed itself.  Wars? Our pedagogues are hard  put to convince their students that  such ever existed. More than a century  and a half ago our society eliminated  the reasons for international  conflict. For that matter,\" he added  musingly, \"we eliminated most international  boundaries. Depressions?  Shortly after your own period, man  awoke to the fact that he had achieved  to the point where it was possible to  produce an abundance for all with a  minimum of toil. Overnight, for all  practical purposes, the whole world  was industrialized, automated. The  second industrial revolution was accompanied  by revolutionary changes  in almost every field, certainly in every  science. Dictators? Your ancestors  found, Mr. Prantera, that it is  difficult for a man to be free so long  as others are still enslaved. Today the  democratic ethic has reached a pinnacle  never dreamed of in your own  era.\"\n\n\n \"O.K., O.K.,\" Joe Prantera growled.  \"So everybody's got it made. What I  wanta know is what's all this about  me giving it ta somebody? If everything's  so great, how come you want  me to knock this guy off?\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell bent forward and  thumped his right index finger twice  on the table. \"The bacterium of hate\u2014a  new strain\u2014has found the human  race unprotected from its disease.  We had thought our vaccines  immunized us.\"\n\n\n \"What's that suppose to mean?\"\n\n\n Brett-James took up the ball again.  \"Mr. Prantera, have you ever heard of  Ghengis Khan, of Tamerlane, Alexander,  Caesar?\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera scowled at him emptily.\n\n\n \"Or, more likely, of Napoleon, Hitler,  Stalin?\"\n\n\n \"Sure I heard of Hitler and Stalin,\"  Joe growled. \"I ain't stupid.\"\n\n\n The other nodded. \"Such men are  unique. They have a drive ... a  drive to power which exceeds by far  the ambitions of the average man.  They are genii in their way, Mr. Prantera,  genii of evil. Such a genius of  evil has appeared on the current  scene.\"\n\n\n \"Now we're getting somewheres,\"  Joe snorted. \"So you got a guy what's  a little ambitious, like, eh? And you  guys ain't got the guts to give it to  him. O.K. What's in it for me?\"\n\n\n The two of them frowned, exchanged  glances. Reston-Farrell said,  \"You know, that is one aspect we had  not considered.\"\n\n\n Brett-James said to Joe Prantera,  \"Had we not, ah, taken you at the  time we did, do you realize what  would have happened?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Joe grunted. \"I woulda let  old Al Rossi have it right in the guts,  five times. Then I woulda took the  plane back to Chi.\"\n\n\n Brett-James was shaking his head.  \"No. You see, by coincidence, a police  squad car was coming down the  street just at that moment to arrest  Mr. Rossi. You would have been apprehended.  As I understand Californian  law of the period, your life  would have been forfeit, Mr. Prantera.\"\n\n\n Joe winced. It didn't occur to him  to doubt their word.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"As to reward,  Mr. Prantera, we have already told  you there is ultra-abundance in this  age. Once this task has been performed,  we will sponsor your entry  into present day society. Competent  psychiatric therapy will soon remove  your present\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Waita minute, now. You figure on  gettin' me candled by some head  shrinker, eh? No thanks, Buster. I'm  going back to my own\u2014\"\n\n\n Brett-James was shaking his head  again. \"I am afraid there is no return,  Mr. Prantera. Time travel works but  in one direction, with the flow of the  time stream. There can be no return  to your own era.\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera had been rocking  with the mental blows he had been  assimilating, but this was the final  haymaker. He was stuck in this  squaresville of a world. Joe Prantera on a job was thorough.\n\n\n Careful, painstaking, competent.\n\n\n He spent the first three days of his  life in the year 2133 getting the feel  of things. Brett-James and Reston-Farrell  had been appointed to work  with him. Joe didn't meet any of the  others who belonged to the group  which had taken the measures to  bring him from the past. He didn't  want to meet them. The fewer persons  involved, the better.\n\n\n He stayed in the apartment of  Reston-Farrell. Joe had been right,  Reston-Farrell was a medical doctor.  Brett-James evidently had something  to do with the process that had enabled  them to bring Joe from the  past. Joe didn't know how they'd  done it, and he didn't care. Joe was a  realist. He was here. The thing was  to adapt.\n\n\n There didn't seem to be any hurry.  Once the deal was made, they left it  up to him to make the decisions.\n\n\n They drove him around the town,  when he wished to check the traffic  arteries. They flew him about the  whole vicinity. From the air, Southern  California looked much the same  as it had in his own time. Oceans,  mountains, and to a lesser extent, deserts,  are fairly permanent even  against man's corroding efforts.\n\n\n It was while he was flying with  Brett-James on the second day that  Joe said, \"How about Mexico? Could  I make the get to Mexico?\"\n\n\n The physicist looked at him questioningly.  \"Get?\" he said.\n\n\n Joe Prantera said impatiently, \"The  getaway. After I give it to this Howard  Temple-Tracy guy, I gotta go on  the run, don't I?\"\n\n\n \"I see.\" Brett-James cleared his  throat. \"Mexico is no longer a separate  nation, Mr. Prantera. All North  America has been united into one  unit. Today, there are only eight nations  in the world.\"\n\n\n \"Where's the nearest?\"\n\n\n \"South America.\"\n\n\n \"That's a helluva long way to go on  a get.\"\n\n\n \"We hadn't thought of the matter  being handled in that manner.\"\n\n\n Joe eyed him in scorn. \"Oh, you  didn't, huh? What happens after I  give it to this guy? I just sit around  and wait for the cops to put the arm  on me?\"\n\n\n Brett-James grimaced in amusement.  \"Mr. Prantera, this will probably  be difficult for you to comprehend,  but there are no police in this  era.\"\n\n\n Joe gaped at him. \"No police!  What happens if you gotta throw  some guy in stir?\"\n\n\n \"If I understand your idiom correctly,  you mean prison. There are  no prisons in this era, Mr. Prantera.\"\n\n\n Joe stared. \"No cops, no jails. What  stops anybody? What stops anybody  from just going into some bank, like,  and collecting up all the bread?\"\n\n\n Brett-James cleared his throat.  \"Mr. Prantera, there are no banks.\"\n\n\n \"No banks! You gotta have banks!\"\n\n\n \"And no money to put in them.  We found it a rather antiquated  method of distribution well over a  century ago.\"\n\n\n Joe had given up. Now he merely  stared.\n\n\n Brett-James said reasonably, \"We  found we were devoting as much  time to financial matters in all their  endless ramifications\u2014including  bank robberies\u2014as we were to productive  efforts. So we turned to more  efficient methods of distribution.\" On the fourth day, Joe said, \"O.K.,  let's get down to facts. Summa the  things you guys say don't stick together  so good. Now, first place,  where's this guy Temple-Tracy you  want knocked off?\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell and Brett-James  were both present. The three of them  sat in the living room of the latter's  apartment, sipping a sparkling wine  which seemed to be the prevailing  beverage of the day. For Joe's taste  it was insipid stuff. Happily, rye was  available to those who wanted it.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"You mean,  where does he reside? Why, here in  this city.\"\n\n\n \"Well, that's handy, eh?\" Joe  scratched himself thoughtfully. \"You  got somebody can finger him for me?\"\n\n\n \"Finger him?\"\n\n\n \"Look, before I can give it to this  guy I gotta know some place where  he'll be at some time. Get it? Like Al  Rossi. My finger, he works in Rossi's  house, see? He lets me know every  Wednesday night, eight o'clock, Al  leaves the house all by hisself. O.K.,  so I can make plans, like, to give it  to him.\" Joe Prantera wound it up  reasonably. \"You gotta have a finger.\"\n\n\n Brett-James said, \"Why not just go  to Temple-Tracy's apartment and, ah,  dispose of him?\"\n\n\n \"Jest walk in, eh? You think I'm  stupid? How do I know how many  witnesses hangin' around? How do I  know if the guy's carryin' heat?\"\n\n\n \"Heat?\"\n\n\n \"A gun, a gun. Ya think I'm stupid?  I come to give it to him and he  gives it to me instead.\"\n\n\n Dr. Reston-Farrell said, \"Howard  Temple-Tracy lives alone. He customarily  receives visitors every afternoon,  largely potential followers. He  is attempting to recruit members to  an organization he is forming. It  would be quite simple for you to  enter his establishment and dispose  of him. I assure you, he does not possess  weapons.\"\n\n\n Joe was indignant. \"Just like that,  eh?\" he said sarcastically. \"Then what  happens? How do I get out of the  building? Where's my get car parked?  Where do I hide out? Where do I  dump the heat?\"\n\n\n \"Dump the heat?\"\n\n\n \"Get rid of the gun. You want I  should get caught with the gun on  me? I'd wind up in the gas chamber  so quick\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, Mr. Prantera,\" Brett-James  said softly. \"We no longer have  capital punishment, you must realize.\"\n\n\n \"O.K. I still don't wanta get caught.  What is the rap these days, huh?\"  Joe scowled. \"You said they didn't  have no jails any more.\"\n\n\n \"This is difficult for you to understand,  I imagine,\" Reston-Farrell told  him, \"but, you see, we no longer punish  people in this era.\"\n\n\n That took a long, unbelieving moment  to sink in. \"You mean, like, no  matter what they do? That's crazy.  Everybody'd be running around giving  it to everybody else.\"\n\n\n \"The motivation for crime has  been removed, Mr. Prantera,\" Reston-Farrell  attempted to explain. \"A  person who commits a violence  against another is obviously in need  of medical care. And, consequently,  receives it.\"\n\n\n \"You mean, like, if I steal a car or  something, they just take me to a  doctor?\" Joe Prantera was unbelieving.\n\n\n \"Why would anybody wish to steal  a car?\" Reston-Farrell said easily.\n\n\n \"But if I give it to somebody?\"\n\n\n \"You will be turned over to a medical  institution. Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy  is the last man you will  ever kill, Mr. Prantera.\"\n\n\n A chillness was in the belly of Joe  Prantera. He said very slowly, very  dangerously, \"You guys figure on me  getting caught, don't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Brett-James said evenly.\n\n\n \"Well then, figure something else.  You think I'm stupid?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Prantera,\" Dr. Reston-Farrell  said, \"there has been as much progress  in the field of psychiatry in the  past two centuries as there has in  any other. Your treatment would be  brief and painless, believe me.\"\n\n\n Joe said coldly, \"And what happens  to you guys? How do you know I  won't rat on you?\"\n\n\n Brett-James said gently, \"The moment  after you have accomplished  your mission, we plan to turn ourselves  over to the nearest institution  to have determined whether or not  we also need therapy.\"\n\n\n \"Now I'm beginning to wonder  about you guys,\" Joe said. \"Look, all  over again, what'd'ya wanta give it to  this guy for?\"\n\n\n The doctor said, \"We explained  the other day, Mr. Prantera. Citizen  Howard Temple-Tracy is a dangerous,  atavistic, evil genius. We are  afraid for our institutions if his plans  are allowed to mature.\"\n\n\n \"Well if you got things so good,  everybody's got it made, like, who'd  listen to him?\"\n\n\n The doctor nodded at the validity  of the question. \"Mr. Prantera, Homo  sapiens is a unique animal. Physically  he matures at approximately the age  of thirteen. However, mental maturity  and adjustment is often not fully  realized until thirty or even more.  Indeed, it is sometimes never  achieved. Before such maturity is  reached, our youth are susceptible to  romantic appeal. Nationalism, chauvinism,  racism, the supposed glory of  the military, all seem romantic to the  immature. They rebel at the orderliness  of present society. They seek entertainment  in excitement. Citizen  Temple-Tracy is aware of this and  finds his recruits among the young.\"\n\n\n \"O.K., so this guy is dangerous.  You want him knocked off before he  screws everything up. But the way  things are, there's no way of making  a get. So you'll have to get some other  patsy. Not me.\"\n\n\n \"I am afraid you have no alternative,\"  Brett-James said gently. \"Without  us, what will you do? Mr. Prantera,  you do not even speak the language.\"\n\n\n \"What'd'ya mean? I don't understand  summa the big words you eggheads  use, but I get by O.K.\"\n\n\n Brett-James said, \"Amer-English is  no longer the language spoken by the  man in the street, Mr. Prantera. Only  students of such subjects any longer  speak such tongues as Amer-English,  French, Russian or the many others  that once confused the race with  their limitations as a means of communication.\"\n\n\n \"You mean there's no place in the  whole world where they talk American?\"  Joe demanded, aghast. Dr. Reston-Farrell controlled the  car. Joe Prantera sat in the seat next  to him and Warren Brett-James sat  in the back. Joe had, tucked in his  belt, a .45 caliber automatic, once displayed  in a museum. It had been  more easily procured than the ammunition  to fit it, but that problem too  had been solved.\n\n\n The others were nervous, obviously  repelled by the very conception of  what they had planned.\n\n\n Inwardly, Joe was amused. Now  that they had got in the clutch, the  others were on the verge of chickening  out. He knew it wouldn't have  taken much for them to cancel the  project. It wasn't any answer though.  If they allowed him to call it off today,  they'd talk themselves into it  again before the week was through.\n\n\n Besides, already Joe was beginning  to feel the comfortable, pleasurable,  warm feeling that came to him on  occasions like this.\n\n\n He said, \"You're sure this guy talks  American, eh?\"\n\n\n Warren Brett-James said, \"Quite  sure. He is a student of history.\"\n\n\n \"And he won't think it's funny I  talk American to him, eh?\"\n\n\n \"He'll undoubtedly be intrigued.\"\n\n\n They pulled up before a large  apartment building that overlooked  the area once known as Wilmington.\n\n\n Joe was coolly efficient now. He  pulled out the automatic, held it  down below his knees and threw a  shell into the barrel. He eased the  hammer down, thumbed on the  safety, stuck the weapon back in his  belt and beneath the jacketlike garment  he wore.\n\n\n He said, \"O.K. See you guys later.\"  He left them and entered the building.\n\n\n An elevator\u2014he still wasn't used  to their speed in this era\u2014whooshed  him to the penthouse duplex occupied  by Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy.\n\n\n There were two persons in the reception  room but they left on Joe's  arrival, without bothering to look at  him more than glancingly.\n\n\n He spotted the screen immediately  and went over and stood before it.\n\n\n The screen lit and revealed a  heavy-set, dour of countenance man  seated at a desk. He looked into Joe  Prantera's face, scowled and said  something.\n\n\n Joe said, \"Joseph Salviati-Prantera  to interview Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy.\"\n\n\n The other's shaggy eyebrows rose.  \"Indeed,\" he said. \"In Amer-English?\"\n\n\n Joe nodded.\n\n\n \"Enter,\" the other said.\n\n\n A door had slid open on the other  side of the room. Joe walked through  it and into what was obviously an office.  Citizen Temple-Tracy sat at a  desk. There was only one other chair  in the room. Joe Prantera ignored it  and remained standing.\n\n\n Citizen Temple-Tracy said, \"What  can I do for you?\"\n\n\n Joe looked at him for a long, long  moment. Then he reached down to  his belt and brought forth the .45  automatic. He moistened his lips.\n\n\n Joe said softly, \"You know what  this here is?\"\n\n\n Temple-Tracy stared at the weapon.  \"It's a handgun, circa, I would  say, about 1925 Old Calendar. What  in the world are you doing with it?\"\n\n\n Joe said, very slowly, \"Chief, in the  line you're in these days you needa  heavy around with wunna these. Otherwise,  Chief, you're gunna wind up  in some gutter with a lotta holes in  you. What I'm doin', I'm askin' for a  job. You need a good man knows how  to handle wunna these, Chief.\"\n\n\n Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy  eyed him appraisingly. \"Perhaps,\" he  said, \"you are right at that. In the near  future, I may well need an assistant  knowledgeable in the field of violence.  Tell me more about yourself.  You surprise me considerably.\"\n\n\n \"Sure, Chief. It's kinda a long  story, though. First off, I better tell  you you got some bad enemies, Chief.  Two guys special, named Brett-James  and Doc Reston-Farrell. I think one  of the first jobs I'm gunna hafta do  for you, Chief, is to give it to those  two.\" THE END Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Analog December  1960.

Something  much the same can be said of the gunman, too.... GUN FOR HIRE By MACK\n\n REYNOLDS Joe Prantera  called  softly, \"Al.\" The pleasurable,  comfortable,  warm feeling began  spreading over him, the  way it always did.\n\n\n The older man stopped and  squinted, but not suspiciously, even  now.\n\n\n The evening was dark, it was unlikely  that the other even saw the  circle of steel that was the mouth of  the shotgun barrel, now resting on  the car's window ledge.\n\n\n \"Who's it?\" he growled.\n\n\n Joe Prantera said softly, \"Big Louis  sent me, Al.\"\n\n\n And he pressed the trigger.\n\n\n And at that moment, the universe  caved inward upon Joseph Marie  Prantera.\n\n\n There was nausea and nausea upon  nausea.\n\n\n There was a falling through all  space and through all time. There was  doubling and twisting and twitching  of every muscle and nerve.\n\n\n There was pain, horror and tumultuous  fear.\n\n\n And he came out of it as quickly  and completely as he'd gone in.\n\n\n He was in, he thought, a hospital  and his first reaction was to think, This here California. Everything different. Then his second thought was Something went wrong. Big Louis, he  ain't going to like this. He brought his thinking to the  present. So far as he could remember,  he hadn't completely pulled the trigger.  That at least meant that whatever  the rap was it wouldn't be too  tough. With luck, the syndicate would  get him off with a couple of years at  Quentin.\n\n\n A door slid open in the wall in a  way that Joe had never seen a door  operate before. This here California. The clothes on the newcomer were  wrong, too. For the first time, Joe  Prantera began to sense an alienness\u2014a  something that was awfully  wrong.\n\n\n The other spoke precisely and  slowly, the way a highly educated man  speaks a language which he reads  and writes fluently but has little occasion  to practice vocally. \"You have recovered?\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera looked at the other  expressionlessly. Maybe the old duck  was one of these foreign doctors, like.\n\n\n The newcomer said, \"You have undoubtedly  been through a most harrowing  experience. If you have any  untoward symptoms, possibly I could  be of assistance.\"\n\n\n Joe couldn't figure out how he  stood. For one thing, there should  have been some kind of police guard.\n\n\n The other said, \"Perhaps a bit of  stimulant?\"\n\n\n Joe said flatly, \"I wanta lawyer.\"\n\n\n The newcomer frowned at him. \"A  lawyer?\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sayin' nothin'. Not until I  get a mouthpiece.\"\n\n\n The newcomer started off on another  tack. \"My name is Lawrence  Reston-Farrell. If I am not mistaken,  you are Joseph Salviati-Prantera.\"\n\n\n Salviati happened to be Joe's mother's  maiden name. But it was unlikely  this character could have known that.  Joe had been born in Naples and his  mother had died in childbirth. His  father hadn't brought him to the  States until the age of five and by that  time he had a stepmother.\n\n\n \"I wanta mouthpiece,\" Joe said  flatly, \"or let me outta here.\"\n\n\n Lawrence Reston-Farrell said, \"You  are not being constrained. There are  clothes for you in the closet there.\"\n\n\n Joe gingerly tried swinging his  feet to the floor and sitting up, while  the other stood watching him, strangely.  He came to his feet. With the exception  of a faint nausea, which  brought back memories of that extreme  condition he'd suffered during  ... during what? He hadn't the  vaguest idea of what had happened.\n\n\n He was dressed in a hospital-type  nightgown. He looked down at it and  snorted and made his way over to the  closet. It opened on his approach, the  door sliding back into the wall in  much the same manner as the room's  door had opened for Reston-Farrell.\n\n\n Joe Prantera scowled and said,  \"These ain't my clothes.\"\n\n\n \"No, I am afraid not.\"\n\n\n \"You think I'd be seen dead wearing  this stuff? What is this, some religious  crackpot hospital?\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"I am afraid,  Mr. Salviati-Prantera, that these are  the only garments available. I suggest  you look out the window there.\"\n\n\n Joe gave him a long, chill look  and then stepped to the window. He  couldn't figure the other. Unless he  was a fruitcake. Maybe he was in  some kind of pressure cooker and  this was one of the fruitcakes.\n\n\n He looked out, however, not on the  lawns and walks of a sanitarium but  upon a wide boulevard of what was  obviously a populous city.\n\n\n And for a moment again, Joe Prantera  felt the depths of nausea.\n\n\n This was not his world.\n\n\n He stared for a long, long moment.  The cars didn't even have wheels, he  noted dully. He turned slowly and  faced the older man.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said compassionately,  \"Try this, it's excellent cognac.\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera stared at him, said finally,  flatly, \"What's it all about?\"\n\n\n The other put down the unaccepted  glass. \"We were afraid first  realization would be a shock to you,\"  he said. \"My colleague is in the adjoining  room. We will be glad to explain  to you if you will join us there.\"\n\n\n \"I wanta get out of here,\" Joe said.\n\n\n \"Where would you go?\"\n\n\n The fear of police, of Al Rossi's  vengeance, of the measures that  might be taken by Big Louis on his  failure, were now far away.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell had approached the  door by which he had entered and it  reopened for him. He went through  it without looking back.\n\n\n There was nothing else to do. Joe  dressed, then followed him. In the adjoining room was a circular  table that would have accommodated  a dozen persons. Two were  seated there now, papers, books and  soiled coffee cups before them. There  had evidently been a long wait.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell, the one Joe had already  met, was tall and drawn of face  and with a chainsmoker's nervousness.  The other was heavier and more  at ease. They were both, Joe estimated,  somewhere in their middle fifties.  They both looked like docs. He  wondered, all over again, if this was  some kind of pressure cooker.\n\n\n But that didn't explain the view  from the window.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"May I present  my colleague, Citizen Warren Brett-James?  Warren, this is our guest from  ... from yesteryear, Mr. Joseph Salviati-Prantera.\"\n\n\n Brett-James nodded to him, friendly,  so far as Joe could see. He said  gently, \"I think it would be Mr. Joseph  Prantera, wouldn't it? The maternal  linage was almost universally  ignored.\" His voice too gave the impression  he was speaking a language  not usually on his tongue.\n\n\n Joe took an empty chair, hardly  bothering to note its alien qualities.  His body seemed to fit into the piece  of furniture, as though it had been  molded to his order.\n\n\n Joe said, \"I think maybe I'll take  that there drink, Doc.\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"Of course,\"  and then something else Joe didn't  get. Whatever the something else  was, a slot opened in the middle of  the table and a glass, so clear of texture  as to be all but invisible, was  elevated. It contained possibly three  ounces of golden fluid.\n\n\n Joe didn't allow himself to think  of its means of delivery. He took up  the drink and bolted it. He put the  glass down and said carefully,  \"What's it all about, huh?\"\n\n\n Warren Brett-James said soothingly,  \"Prepare yourself for somewhat  of a shock, Mr. Prantera. You are no  longer in Los Angeles\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Ya think I'm stupid? I can see  that.\"\n\n\n \"I was about to say, Los Angeles of  1960. Mr. Prantera, we welcome you  to Nuevo Los Angeles.\"\n\n\n \"Ta where?\"\n\n\n \"To Nuevo Los Angeles and to  the year\u2014\" Brett-James looked at his  companion. \"What is the date, Old  Calendar?\"\n\n\n \"2133,\" Reston-Farrell said. \"2133  A.D. they would say.\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera looked from one of  them to the other, scowling. \"What  are you guys talking about?\"\n\n\n Warren Brett-James said softly,  \"Mr. Prantera, you are no longer in  the year 1960, you are now in the  year 2133.\"\n\n\n He said, uncomprehendingly, \"You  mean I been, like, unconscious for\u2014\"  He let the sentence fall away as he  realized the impossibility.\n\n\n Brett-James said gently, \"Hardly  for one hundred and seventy years,  Mr. Prantera.\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"I am afraid we  are confusing you. Briefly, we have transported you, I suppose one might  say, from your own era to ours.\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera had never been exposed  to the concept of time travel.  He had simply never associated with  anyone who had ever even remotely  considered such an idea. Now he said,  \"You mean, like, I been asleep all  that time?\"\n\n\n \"Not exactly,\" Brett-James said,  frowning.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"Suffice to say,  you are now one hundred and seventy-three  years after the last memory you  have.\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera's mind suddenly reverted  to those last memories and his  eyes narrowed dangerously. He felt  suddenly at bay. He said, \"Maybe  you guys better let me in on what's  this all about.\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"Mr. Prantera,  we have brought you from your era  to perform a task for us.\"\n\n\n Joe stared at him, and then at the  other. He couldn't believe he was getting  through to them. Or, at least,  that they were to him.\n\n\n Finally he said, \"If I get this, you  want me to do a job for you.\"\n\n\n \"That is correct.\"\n\n\n Joe said, \"You guys know the kind  of jobs I do?\"\n\n\n \"That is correct.\"\n\n\n \"Like hell you do. You think I'm  stupid? I never even seen you before.\"  Joe Prantera came abruptly to  his feet. \"I'm gettin' outta here.\"\n\n\n For the second time, Reston-Farrell  said, \"Where would you go, Mr.  Prantera?\"\n\n\n Joe glared at him. Then sat down  again, as abruptly as he'd arisen. \"Let's start all over again. I got this  straight, you brought me, some  screwy way, all the way ... here.  O.K., I'll buy that. I seen what it looks  like out that window\u2014\" The real  comprehension was seeping through  to him even as he talked. \"Everybody  I know, Jessie, Tony, the Kid, Big  Louis, everybody, they're dead. Even  Big Louis.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Brett-James said, his voice  soft. \"They are all dead, Mr. Prantera.  Their children are all dead, and their  grandchildren.\"\n\n\n The two men of the future said  nothing more for long minutes while  Joe Prantera's mind whirled its confusion.\n\n\n Finally he said, \"What's this bit  about you wanting me to give it to  some guy.\"\n\n\n \"That is why we brought you here,  Mr. Prantera. You were ... you  are, a professional assassin.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, wait a minute, now.\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell went on, ignoring  the interruption. \"There is small  point in denying your calling. Pray  remember that at the point when we  ... transported you, you were about  to dispose of a contemporary named  Alphonso Annunziata-Rossi. A citizen,  I might say, whose demise would  probably have caused small dismay to  society.\"\n\n\n They had him pegged all right. Joe  said, \"But why me? Why don't you  get some heavy from now? Somebody  knows the ropes these days.\"\n\n\n Brett-James said, \"Mr. Prantera,  there are no professional assassins in  this age, nor have there been for over  a century and a half.\"\n\n\n \"Well, then do it yourself.\" Joe  Prantera's irritation over this whole  complicated mess was growing. And  already he was beginning to long for  the things he knew\u2014for Jessie and  Tony and the others, for his favorite  bar, for the lasagne down at Papa  Giovanni's. Right now he could have  welcomed a calling down at the hands  of Big Louis.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell had come to his feet  and walked to one of the large room's  windows. He looked out, as though  unseeing. Then, his back turned, he  said, \"We have tried, but it is simply  not in us, Mr. Prantera.\"\n\n\n \"You mean you're yella?\"\n\n\n \"No, if by that you mean afraid. It  is simply not within us to take the  life of a fellow creature\u2014not to speak  of a fellow man.\"\n\n\n Joe snapped: \"Everything you guys  say sounds crazy. Let's start all over  again.\"\n\n\n Brett-James said, \"Let me do it,  Lawrence.\" He turned his eyes to Joe.  \"Mr. Prantera, in your own era, did  you ever consider the future?\"\n\n\n Joe looked at him blankly.\n\n\n \"In your day you were confronted  with national and international, problems.  Just as we are today and just as  nations were a century or a millennium  ago.\"\n\n\n \"Sure, O.K., so we had problems. I  know whatcha mean\u2014like wars, and  depressions and dictators and like  that.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, like that,\" Brett-James  nodded.\n\n\n The heavy-set man paused a moment.  \"Yes, like that,\" he repeated.  \"That we confront you now indicates  that the problems of your day were  solved. Hadn't they been, the world  most surely would have destroyed itself.  Wars? Our pedagogues are hard  put to convince their students that  such ever existed. More than a century  and a half ago our society eliminated  the reasons for international  conflict. For that matter,\" he added  musingly, \"we eliminated most international  boundaries. Depressions?  Shortly after your own period, man  awoke to the fact that he had achieved  to the point where it was possible to  produce an abundance for all with a  minimum of toil. Overnight, for all  practical purposes, the whole world  was industrialized, automated. The  second industrial revolution was accompanied  by revolutionary changes  in almost every field, certainly in every  science. Dictators? Your ancestors  found, Mr. Prantera, that it is  difficult for a man to be free so long  as others are still enslaved. Today the  democratic ethic has reached a pinnacle  never dreamed of in your own  era.\"\n\n\n \"O.K., O.K.,\" Joe Prantera growled.  \"So everybody's got it made. What I  wanta know is what's all this about  me giving it ta somebody? If everything's  so great, how come you want  me to knock this guy off?\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell bent forward and  thumped his right index finger twice  on the table. \"The bacterium of hate\u2014a  new strain\u2014has found the human  race unprotected from its disease.  We had thought our vaccines  immunized us.\"\n\n\n \"What's that suppose to mean?\"\n\n\n Brett-James took up the ball again.  \"Mr. Prantera, have you ever heard of  Ghengis Khan, of Tamerlane, Alexander,  Caesar?\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera scowled at him emptily.\n\n\n \"Or, more likely, of Napoleon, Hitler,  Stalin?\"\n\n\n \"Sure I heard of Hitler and Stalin,\"  Joe growled. \"I ain't stupid.\"\n\n\n The other nodded. \"Such men are  unique. They have a drive ... a  drive to power which exceeds by far  the ambitions of the average man.  They are genii in their way, Mr. Prantera,  genii of evil. Such a genius of  evil has appeared on the current  scene.\"\n\n\n \"Now we're getting somewheres,\"  Joe snorted. \"So you got a guy what's  a little ambitious, like, eh? And you  guys ain't got the guts to give it to  him. O.K. What's in it for me?\"\n\n\n The two of them frowned, exchanged  glances. Reston-Farrell said,  \"You know, that is one aspect we had  not considered.\"\n\n\n Brett-James said to Joe Prantera,  \"Had we not, ah, taken you at the  time we did, do you realize what  would have happened?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Joe grunted. \"I woulda let  old Al Rossi have it right in the guts,  five times. Then I woulda took the  plane back to Chi.\"\n\n\n Brett-James was shaking his head.  \"No. You see, by coincidence, a police  squad car was coming down the  street just at that moment to arrest  Mr. Rossi. You would have been apprehended.  As I understand Californian  law of the period, your life  would have been forfeit, Mr. Prantera.\"\n\n\n Joe winced. It didn't occur to him  to doubt their word.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"As to reward,  Mr. Prantera, we have already told  you there is ultra-abundance in this  age. Once this task has been performed,  we will sponsor your entry  into present day society. Competent  psychiatric therapy will soon remove  your present\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Waita minute, now. You figure on  gettin' me candled by some head  shrinker, eh? No thanks, Buster. I'm  going back to my own\u2014\"\n\n\n Brett-James was shaking his head  again. \"I am afraid there is no return,  Mr. Prantera. Time travel works but  in one direction, with the flow of the  time stream. There can be no return  to your own era.\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera had been rocking  with the mental blows he had been  assimilating, but this was the final  haymaker. He was stuck in this  squaresville of a world. Joe Prantera on a job was thorough.\n\n\n Careful, painstaking, competent.\n\n\n He spent the first three days of his  life in the year 2133 getting the feel  of things. Brett-James and Reston-Farrell  had been appointed to work  with him. Joe didn't meet any of the  others who belonged to the group  which had taken the measures to  bring him from the past. He didn't  want to meet them. The fewer persons  involved, the better.\n\n\n He stayed in the apartment of  Reston-Farrell. Joe had been right,  Reston-Farrell was a medical doctor.  Brett-James evidently had something  to do with the process that had enabled  them to bring Joe from the  past. Joe didn't know how they'd  done it, and he didn't care. Joe was a  realist. He was here. The thing was  to adapt.\n\n\n There didn't seem to be any hurry.  Once the deal was made, they left it  up to him to make the decisions.\n\n\n They drove him around the town,  when he wished to check the traffic  arteries. They flew him about the  whole vicinity. From the air, Southern  California looked much the same  as it had in his own time. Oceans,  mountains, and to a lesser extent, deserts,  are fairly permanent even  against man's corroding efforts.\n\n\n It was while he was flying with  Brett-James on the second day that  Joe said, \"How about Mexico? Could  I make the get to Mexico?\"\n\n\n The physicist looked at him questioningly.  \"Get?\" he said.\n\n\n Joe Prantera said impatiently, \"The  getaway. After I give it to this Howard  Temple-Tracy guy, I gotta go on  the run, don't I?\"\n\n\n \"I see.\" Brett-James cleared his  throat. \"Mexico is no longer a separate  nation, Mr. Prantera. All North  America has been united into one  unit. Today, there are only eight nations  in the world.\"\n\n\n \"Where's the nearest?\"\n\n\n \"South America.\"\n\n\n \"That's a helluva long way to go on  a get.\"\n\n\n \"We hadn't thought of the matter  being handled in that manner.\"\n\n\n Joe eyed him in scorn. \"Oh, you  didn't, huh? What happens after I  give it to this guy? I just sit around  and wait for the cops to put the arm  on me?\"\n\n\n Brett-James grimaced in amusement.  \"Mr. Prantera, this will probably  be difficult for you to comprehend,  but there are no police in this  era.\"\n\n\n Joe gaped at him. \"No police!  What happens if you gotta throw  some guy in stir?\"\n\n\n \"If I understand your idiom correctly,  you mean prison. There are  no prisons in this era, Mr. Prantera.\"\n\n\n Joe stared. \"No cops, no jails. What  stops anybody? What stops anybody  from just going into some bank, like,  and collecting up all the bread?\"\n\n\n Brett-James cleared his throat.  \"Mr. Prantera, there are no banks.\"\n\n\n \"No banks! You gotta have banks!\"\n\n\n \"And no money to put in them.  We found it a rather antiquated  method of distribution well over a  century ago.\"\n\n\n Joe had given up. Now he merely  stared.\n\n\n Brett-James said reasonably, \"We  found we were devoting as much  time to financial matters in all their  endless ramifications\u2014including  bank robberies\u2014as we were to productive  efforts. So we turned to more  efficient methods of distribution.\" On the fourth day, Joe said, \"O.K.,  let's get down to facts. Summa the  things you guys say don't stick together  so good. Now, first place,  where's this guy Temple-Tracy you  want knocked off?\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell and Brett-James  were both present. The three of them  sat in the living room of the latter's  apartment, sipping a sparkling wine  which seemed to be the prevailing  beverage of the day. For Joe's taste  it was insipid stuff. Happily, rye was  available to those who wanted it.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"You mean,  where does he reside? Why, here in  this city.\"\n\n\n \"Well, that's handy, eh?\" Joe  scratched himself thoughtfully. \"You  got somebody can finger him for me?\"\n\n\n \"Finger him?\"\n\n\n \"Look, before I can give it to this  guy I gotta know some place where  he'll be at some time. Get it? Like Al  Rossi. My finger, he works in Rossi's  house, see? He lets me know every  Wednesday night, eight o'clock, Al  leaves the house all by hisself. O.K.,  so I can make plans, like, to give it  to him.\" Joe Prantera wound it up  reasonably. \"You gotta have a finger.\"\n\n\n Brett-James said, \"Why not just go  to Temple-Tracy's apartment and, ah,  dispose of him?\"\n\n\n \"Jest walk in, eh? You think I'm  stupid? How do I know how many  witnesses hangin' around? How do I  know if the guy's carryin' heat?\"\n\n\n \"Heat?\"\n\n\n \"A gun, a gun. Ya think I'm stupid?  I come to give it to him and he  gives it to me instead.\"\n\n\n Dr. Reston-Farrell said, \"Howard  Temple-Tracy lives alone. He customarily  receives visitors every afternoon,  largely potential followers. He  is attempting to recruit members to  an organization he is forming. It  would be quite simple for you to  enter his establishment and dispose  of him. I assure you, he does not possess  weapons.\"\n\n\n Joe was indignant. \"Just like that,  eh?\" he said sarcastically. \"Then what  happens? How do I get out of the  building? Where's my get car parked?  Where do I hide out? Where do I  dump the heat?\"\n\n\n \"Dump the heat?\"\n\n\n \"Get rid of the gun. You want I  should get caught with the gun on  me? I'd wind up in the gas chamber  so quick\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, Mr. Prantera,\" Brett-James  said softly. \"We no longer have  capital punishment, you must realize.\"\n\n\n \"O.K. I still don't wanta get caught.  What is the rap these days, huh?\"  Joe scowled. \"You said they didn't  have no jails any more.\"\n\n\n \"This is difficult for you to understand,  I imagine,\" Reston-Farrell told  him, \"but, you see, we no longer punish  people in this era.\"\n\n\n That took a long, unbelieving moment  to sink in. \"You mean, like, no  matter what they do? That's crazy.  Everybody'd be running around giving  it to everybody else.\"\n\n\n \"The motivation for crime has  been removed, Mr. Prantera,\" Reston-Farrell  attempted to explain. \"A  person who commits a violence  against another is obviously in need  of medical care. And, consequently,  receives it.\"\n\n\n \"You mean, like, if I steal a car or  something, they just take me to a  doctor?\" Joe Prantera was unbelieving.\n\n\n \"Why would anybody wish to steal  a car?\" Reston-Farrell said easily.\n\n\n \"But if I give it to somebody?\"\n\n\n \"You will be turned over to a medical  institution. Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy  is the last man you will  ever kill, Mr. Prantera.\"\n\n\n A chillness was in the belly of Joe  Prantera. He said very slowly, very  dangerously, \"You guys figure on me  getting caught, don't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Brett-James said evenly.\n\n\n \"Well then, figure something else.  You think I'm stupid?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Prantera,\" Dr. Reston-Farrell  said, \"there has been as much progress  in the field of psychiatry in the  past two centuries as there has in  any other. Your treatment would be  brief and painless, believe me.\"\n\n\n Joe said coldly, \"And what happens  to you guys? How do you know I  won't rat on you?\"\n\n\n Brett-James said gently, \"The moment  after you have accomplished  your mission, we plan to turn ourselves  over to the nearest institution  to have determined whether or not  we also need therapy.\"\n\n\n \"Now I'm beginning to wonder  about you guys,\" Joe said. \"Look, all  over again, what'd'ya wanta give it to  this guy for?\"\n\n\n The doctor said, \"We explained  the other day, Mr. Prantera. Citizen  Howard Temple-Tracy is a dangerous,  atavistic, evil genius. We are  afraid for our institutions if his plans  are allowed to mature.\"\n\n\n \"Well if you got things so good,  everybody's got it made, like, who'd  listen to him?\"\n\n\n The doctor nodded at the validity  of the question. \"Mr. Prantera, Homo  sapiens is a unique animal. Physically  he matures at approximately the age  of thirteen. However, mental maturity  and adjustment is often not fully  realized until thirty or even more.  Indeed, it is sometimes never  achieved. Before such maturity is  reached, our youth are susceptible to  romantic appeal. Nationalism, chauvinism,  racism, the supposed glory of  the military, all seem romantic to the  immature. They rebel at the orderliness  of present society. They seek entertainment  in excitement. Citizen  Temple-Tracy is aware of this and  finds his recruits among the young.\"\n\n\n \"O.K., so this guy is dangerous.  You want him knocked off before he  screws everything up. But the way  things are, there's no way of making  a get. So you'll have to get some other  patsy. Not me.\"\n\n\n \"I am afraid you have no alternative,\"  Brett-James said gently. \"Without  us, what will you do? Mr. Prantera,  you do not even speak the language.\"\n\n\n \"What'd'ya mean? I don't understand  summa the big words you eggheads  use, but I get by O.K.\"\n\n\n Brett-James said, \"Amer-English is  no longer the language spoken by the  man in the street, Mr. Prantera. Only  students of such subjects any longer  speak such tongues as Amer-English,  French, Russian or the many others  that once confused the race with  their limitations as a means of communication.\"\n\n\n \"You mean there's no place in the  whole world where they talk American?\"  Joe demanded, aghast. Dr. Reston-Farrell controlled the  car. Joe Prantera sat in the seat next  to him and Warren Brett-James sat  in the back. Joe had, tucked in his  belt, a .45 caliber automatic, once displayed  in a museum. It had been  more easily procured than the ammunition  to fit it, but that problem too  had been solved.\n\n\n The others were nervous, obviously  repelled by the very conception of  what they had planned.\n\n\n Inwardly, Joe was amused. Now  that they had got in the clutch, the  others were on the verge of chickening  out. He knew it wouldn't have  taken much for them to cancel the  project. It wasn't any answer though.  If they allowed him to call it off today,  they'd talk themselves into it  again before the week was through.\n\n\n Besides, already Joe was beginning  to feel the comfortable, pleasurable,  warm feeling that came to him on  occasions like this.\n\n\n He said, \"You're sure this guy talks  American, eh?\"\n\n\n Warren Brett-James said, \"Quite  sure. He is a student of history.\"\n\n\n \"And he won't think it's funny I  talk American to him, eh?\"\n\n\n \"He'll undoubtedly be intrigued.\"\n\n\n They pulled up before a large  apartment building that overlooked  the area once known as Wilmington.\n\n\n Joe was coolly efficient now. He  pulled out the automatic, held it  down below his knees and threw a  shell into the barrel. He eased the  hammer down, thumbed on the  safety, stuck the weapon back in his  belt and beneath the jacketlike garment  he wore.\n\n\n He said, \"O.K. See you guys later.\"  He left them and entered the building.\n\n\n An elevator\u2014he still wasn't used  to their speed in this era\u2014whooshed  him to the penthouse duplex occupied  by Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy.\n\n\n There were two persons in the reception  room but they left on Joe's  arrival, without bothering to look at  him more than glancingly.\n\n\n He spotted the screen immediately  and went over and stood before it.\n\n\n The screen lit and revealed a  heavy-set, dour of countenance man  seated at a desk. He looked into Joe  Prantera's face, scowled and said  something.\n\n\n Joe said, \"Joseph Salviati-Prantera  to interview Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy.\"\n\n\n The other's shaggy eyebrows rose.  \"Indeed,\" he said. \"In Amer-English?\"\n\n\n Joe nodded.\n\n\n \"Enter,\" the other said.\n\n\n A door had slid open on the other  side of the room. Joe walked through  it and into what was obviously an office.  Citizen Temple-Tracy sat at a  desk. There was only one other chair  in the room. Joe Prantera ignored it  and remained standing.\n\n\n Citizen Temple-Tracy said, \"What  can I do for you?\"\n\n\n Joe looked at him for a long, long  moment. Then he reached down to  his belt and brought forth the .45  automatic. He moistened his lips.\n\n\n Joe said softly, \"You know what  this here is?\"\n\n\n Temple-Tracy stared at the weapon.  \"It's a handgun, circa, I would  say, about 1925 Old Calendar. What  in the world are you doing with it?\"\n\n\n Joe said, very slowly, \"Chief, in the  line you're in these days you needa  heavy around with wunna these. Otherwise,  Chief, you're gunna wind up  in some gutter with a lotta holes in  you. What I'm doin', I'm askin' for a  job. You need a good man knows how  to handle wunna these, Chief.\"\n\n\n Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy  eyed him appraisingly. \"Perhaps,\" he  said, \"you are right at that. In the near  future, I may well need an assistant  knowledgeable in the field of violence.  Tell me more about yourself.  You surprise me considerably.\"\n\n\n \"Sure, Chief. It's kinda a long  story, though. First off, I better tell  you you got some bad enemies, Chief.  Two guys special, named Brett-James  and Doc Reston-Farrell. I think one  of the first jobs I'm gunna hafta do  for you, Chief, is to give it to those  two.\" THE END Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Analog December  1960.

GUN FOR HIRE By MACK\n\n REYNOLDS Joe Prantera  called  softly, \"Al.\" The pleasurable,  comfortable,  warm feeling began  spreading over him, the  way it always did.\n\n\n The older man stopped and  squinted, but not suspiciously, even  now.\n\n\n The evening was dark, it was unlikely  that the other even saw the  circle of steel that was the mouth of  the shotgun barrel, now resting on  the car's window ledge.\n\n\n \"Who's it?\" he growled.\n\n\n Joe Prantera said softly, \"Big Louis  sent me, Al.\"\n\n\n And he pressed the trigger.\n\n\n And at that moment, the universe  caved inward upon Joseph Marie  Prantera.\n\n\n There was nausea and nausea upon  nausea.\n\n\n There was a falling through all  space and through all time. There was  doubling and twisting and twitching  of every muscle and nerve.\n\n\n There was pain, horror and tumultuous  fear.\n\n\n And he came out of it as quickly  and completely as he'd gone in.\n\n\n He was in, he thought, a hospital  and his first reaction was to think, This here California. Everything different. Then his second thought was Something went wrong. Big Louis, he  ain't going to like this. He brought his thinking to the  present. So far as he could remember,  he hadn't completely pulled the trigger.  That at least meant that whatever  the rap was it wouldn't be too  tough. With luck, the syndicate would  get him off with a couple of years at  Quentin.\n\n\n A door slid open in the wall in a  way that Joe had never seen a door  operate before. This here California. The clothes on the newcomer were  wrong, too. For the first time, Joe  Prantera began to sense an alienness\u2014a  something that was awfully  wrong.\n\n\n The other spoke precisely and  slowly, the way a highly educated man  speaks a language which he reads  and writes fluently but has little occasion  to practice vocally. \"You have recovered?\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera looked at the other  expressionlessly. Maybe the old duck  was one of these foreign doctors, like.\n\n\n The newcomer said, \"You have undoubtedly  been through a most harrowing  experience. If you have any  untoward symptoms, possibly I could  be of assistance.\"\n\n\n Joe couldn't figure out how he  stood. For one thing, there should  have been some kind of police guard.\n\n\n The other said, \"Perhaps a bit of  stimulant?\"\n\n\n Joe said flatly, \"I wanta lawyer.\"\n\n\n The newcomer frowned at him. \"A  lawyer?\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sayin' nothin'. Not until I  get a mouthpiece.\"\n\n\n The newcomer started off on another  tack. \"My name is Lawrence  Reston-Farrell. If I am not mistaken,  you are Joseph Salviati-Prantera.\"\n\n\n Salviati happened to be Joe's mother's  maiden name. But it was unlikely  this character could have known that.  Joe had been born in Naples and his  mother had died in childbirth. His  father hadn't brought him to the  States until the age of five and by that  time he had a stepmother.\n\n\n \"I wanta mouthpiece,\" Joe said  flatly, \"or let me outta here.\"\n\n\n Lawrence Reston-Farrell said, \"You  are not being constrained. There are  clothes for you in the closet there.\"\n\n\n Joe gingerly tried swinging his  feet to the floor and sitting up, while  the other stood watching him, strangely.  He came to his feet. With the exception  of a faint nausea, which  brought back memories of that extreme  condition he'd suffered during  ... during what? He hadn't the  vaguest idea of what had happened.\n\n\n He was dressed in a hospital-type  nightgown. He looked down at it and  snorted and made his way over to the  closet. It opened on his approach, the  door sliding back into the wall in  much the same manner as the room's  door had opened for Reston-Farrell.\n\n\n Joe Prantera scowled and said,  \"These ain't my clothes.\"\n\n\n \"No, I am afraid not.\"\n\n\n \"You think I'd be seen dead wearing  this stuff? What is this, some religious  crackpot hospital?\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"I am afraid,  Mr. Salviati-Prantera, that these are  the only garments available. I suggest  you look out the window there.\"\n\n\n Joe gave him a long, chill look  and then stepped to the window. He  couldn't figure the other. Unless he  was a fruitcake. Maybe he was in  some kind of pressure cooker and  this was one of the fruitcakes.\n\n\n He looked out, however, not on the  lawns and walks of a sanitarium but  upon a wide boulevard of what was  obviously a populous city.\n\n\n And for a moment again, Joe Prantera  felt the depths of nausea.\n\n\n This was not his world.\n\n\n He stared for a long, long moment.  The cars didn't even have wheels, he  noted dully. He turned slowly and  faced the older man.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said compassionately,  \"Try this, it's excellent cognac.\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera stared at him, said finally,  flatly, \"What's it all about?\"\n\n\n The other put down the unaccepted  glass. \"We were afraid first  realization would be a shock to you,\"  he said. \"My colleague is in the adjoining  room. We will be glad to explain  to you if you will join us there.\"\n\n\n \"I wanta get out of here,\" Joe said.\n\n\n \"Where would you go?\"\n\n\n The fear of police, of Al Rossi's  vengeance, of the measures that  might be taken by Big Louis on his  failure, were now far away.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell had approached the  door by which he had entered and it  reopened for him. He went through  it without looking back.\n\n\n There was nothing else to do. Joe  dressed, then followed him. In the adjoining room was a circular  table that would have accommodated  a dozen persons. Two were  seated there now, papers, books and  soiled coffee cups before them. There  had evidently been a long wait.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell, the one Joe had already  met, was tall and drawn of face  and with a chainsmoker's nervousness.  The other was heavier and more  at ease. They were both, Joe estimated,  somewhere in their middle fifties.  They both looked like docs. He  wondered, all over again, if this was  some kind of pressure cooker.\n\n\n But that didn't explain the view  from the window.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"May I present  my colleague, Citizen Warren Brett-James?  Warren, this is our guest from  ... from yesteryear, Mr. Joseph Salviati-Prantera.\"\n\n\n Brett-James nodded to him, friendly,  so far as Joe could see. He said  gently, \"I think it would be Mr. Joseph  Prantera, wouldn't it? The maternal  linage was almost universally  ignored.\" His voice too gave the impression  he was speaking a language  not usually on his tongue.\n\n\n Joe took an empty chair, hardly  bothering to note its alien qualities.  His body seemed to fit into the piece  of furniture, as though it had been  molded to his order.\n\n\n Joe said, \"I think maybe I'll take  that there drink, Doc.\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"Of course,\"  and then something else Joe didn't  get. Whatever the something else  was, a slot opened in the middle of  the table and a glass, so clear of texture  as to be all but invisible, was  elevated. It contained possibly three  ounces of golden fluid.\n\n\n Joe didn't allow himself to think  of its means of delivery. He took up  the drink and bolted it. He put the  glass down and said carefully,  \"What's it all about, huh?\"\n\n\n Warren Brett-James said soothingly,  \"Prepare yourself for somewhat  of a shock, Mr. Prantera. You are no  longer in Los Angeles\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Ya think I'm stupid? I can see  that.\"\n\n\n \"I was about to say, Los Angeles of  1960. Mr. Prantera, we welcome you  to Nuevo Los Angeles.\"\n\n\n \"Ta where?\"\n\n\n \"To Nuevo Los Angeles and to  the year\u2014\" Brett-James looked at his  companion. \"What is the date, Old  Calendar?\"\n\n\n \"2133,\" Reston-Farrell said. \"2133  A.D. they would say.\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera looked from one of  them to the other, scowling. \"What  are you guys talking about?\"\n\n\n Warren Brett-James said softly,  \"Mr. Prantera, you are no longer in  the year 1960, you are now in the  year 2133.\"\n\n\n He said, uncomprehendingly, \"You  mean I been, like, unconscious for\u2014\"  He let the sentence fall away as he  realized the impossibility.\n\n\n Brett-James said gently, \"Hardly  for one hundred and seventy years,  Mr. Prantera.\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"I am afraid we  are confusing you. Briefly, we have transported you, I suppose one might  say, from your own era to ours.\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera had never been exposed  to the concept of time travel.  He had simply never associated with  anyone who had ever even remotely  considered such an idea. Now he said,  \"You mean, like, I been asleep all  that time?\"\n\n\n \"Not exactly,\" Brett-James said,  frowning.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"Suffice to say,  you are now one hundred and seventy-three  years after the last memory you  have.\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera's mind suddenly reverted  to those last memories and his  eyes narrowed dangerously. He felt  suddenly at bay. He said, \"Maybe  you guys better let me in on what's  this all about.\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"Mr. Prantera,  we have brought you from your era  to perform a task for us.\"\n\n\n Joe stared at him, and then at the  other. He couldn't believe he was getting  through to them. Or, at least,  that they were to him.\n\n\n Finally he said, \"If I get this, you  want me to do a job for you.\"\n\n\n \"That is correct.\"\n\n\n Joe said, \"You guys know the kind  of jobs I do?\"\n\n\n \"That is correct.\"\n\n\n \"Like hell you do. You think I'm  stupid? I never even seen you before.\"  Joe Prantera came abruptly to  his feet. \"I'm gettin' outta here.\"\n\n\n For the second time, Reston-Farrell  said, \"Where would you go, Mr.  Prantera?\"\n\n\n Joe glared at him. Then sat down  again, as abruptly as he'd arisen. \"Let's start all over again. I got this  straight, you brought me, some  screwy way, all the way ... here.  O.K., I'll buy that. I seen what it looks  like out that window\u2014\" The real  comprehension was seeping through  to him even as he talked. \"Everybody  I know, Jessie, Tony, the Kid, Big  Louis, everybody, they're dead. Even  Big Louis.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Brett-James said, his voice  soft. \"They are all dead, Mr. Prantera.  Their children are all dead, and their  grandchildren.\"\n\n\n The two men of the future said  nothing more for long minutes while  Joe Prantera's mind whirled its confusion.\n\n\n Finally he said, \"What's this bit  about you wanting me to give it to  some guy.\"\n\n\n \"That is why we brought you here,  Mr. Prantera. You were ... you  are, a professional assassin.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, wait a minute, now.\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell went on, ignoring  the interruption. \"There is small  point in denying your calling. Pray  remember that at the point when we  ... transported you, you were about  to dispose of a contemporary named  Alphonso Annunziata-Rossi. A citizen,  I might say, whose demise would  probably have caused small dismay to  society.\"\n\n\n They had him pegged all right. Joe  said, \"But why me? Why don't you  get some heavy from now? Somebody  knows the ropes these days.\"\n\n\n Brett-James said, \"Mr. Prantera,  there are no professional assassins in  this age, nor have there been for over  a century and a half.\"\n\n\n \"Well, then do it yourself.\" Joe  Prantera's irritation over this whole  complicated mess was growing. And  already he was beginning to long for  the things he knew\u2014for Jessie and  Tony and the others, for his favorite  bar, for the lasagne down at Papa  Giovanni's. Right now he could have  welcomed a calling down at the hands  of Big Louis.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell had come to his feet  and walked to one of the large room's  windows. He looked out, as though  unseeing. Then, his back turned, he  said, \"We have tried, but it is simply  not in us, Mr. Prantera.\"\n\n\n \"You mean you're yella?\"\n\n\n \"No, if by that you mean afraid. It  is simply not within us to take the  life of a fellow creature\u2014not to speak  of a fellow man.\"\n\n\n Joe snapped: \"Everything you guys  say sounds crazy. Let's start all over  again.\"\n\n\n Brett-James said, \"Let me do it,  Lawrence.\" He turned his eyes to Joe.  \"Mr. Prantera, in your own era, did  you ever consider the future?\"\n\n\n Joe looked at him blankly.\n\n\n \"In your day you were confronted  with national and international, problems.  Just as we are today and just as  nations were a century or a millennium  ago.\"\n\n\n \"Sure, O.K., so we had problems. I  know whatcha mean\u2014like wars, and  depressions and dictators and like  that.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, like that,\" Brett-James  nodded.\n\n\n The heavy-set man paused a moment.  \"Yes, like that,\" he repeated.  \"That we confront you now indicates  that the problems of your day were  solved. Hadn't they been, the world  most surely would have destroyed itself.  Wars? Our pedagogues are hard  put to convince their students that  such ever existed. More than a century  and a half ago our society eliminated  the reasons for international  conflict. For that matter,\" he added  musingly, \"we eliminated most international  boundaries. Depressions?  Shortly after your own period, man  awoke to the fact that he had achieved  to the point where it was possible to  produce an abundance for all with a  minimum of toil. Overnight, for all  practical purposes, the whole world  was industrialized, automated. The  second industrial revolution was accompanied  by revolutionary changes  in almost every field, certainly in every  science. Dictators? Your ancestors  found, Mr. Prantera, that it is  difficult for a man to be free so long  as others are still enslaved. Today the  democratic ethic has reached a pinnacle  never dreamed of in your own  era.\"\n\n\n \"O.K., O.K.,\" Joe Prantera growled.  \"So everybody's got it made. What I  wanta know is what's all this about  me giving it ta somebody? If everything's  so great, how come you want  me to knock this guy off?\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell bent forward and  thumped his right index finger twice  on the table. \"The bacterium of hate\u2014a  new strain\u2014has found the human  race unprotected from its disease.  We had thought our vaccines  immunized us.\"\n\n\n \"What's that suppose to mean?\"\n\n\n Brett-James took up the ball again.  \"Mr. Prantera, have you ever heard of  Ghengis Khan, of Tamerlane, Alexander,  Caesar?\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera scowled at him emptily.\n\n\n \"Or, more likely, of Napoleon, Hitler,  Stalin?\"\n\n\n \"Sure I heard of Hitler and Stalin,\"  Joe growled. \"I ain't stupid.\"\n\n\n The other nodded. \"Such men are  unique. They have a drive ... a  drive to power which exceeds by far  the ambitions of the average man.  They are genii in their way, Mr. Prantera,  genii of evil. Such a genius of  evil has appeared on the current  scene.\"\n\n\n \"Now we're getting somewheres,\"  Joe snorted. \"So you got a guy what's  a little ambitious, like, eh? And you  guys ain't got the guts to give it to  him. O.K. What's in it for me?\"\n\n\n The two of them frowned, exchanged  glances. Reston-Farrell said,  \"You know, that is one aspect we had  not considered.\"\n\n\n Brett-James said to Joe Prantera,  \"Had we not, ah, taken you at the  time we did, do you realize what  would have happened?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Joe grunted. \"I woulda let  old Al Rossi have it right in the guts,  five times. Then I woulda took the  plane back to Chi.\"\n\n\n Brett-James was shaking his head.  \"No. You see, by coincidence, a police  squad car was coming down the  street just at that moment to arrest  Mr. Rossi. You would have been apprehended.  As I understand Californian  law of the period, your life  would have been forfeit, Mr. Prantera.\"\n\n\n Joe winced. It didn't occur to him  to doubt their word.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"As to reward,  Mr. Prantera, we have already told  you there is ultra-abundance in this  age. Once this task has been performed,  we will sponsor your entry  into present day society. Competent  psychiatric therapy will soon remove  your present\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Waita minute, now. You figure on  gettin' me candled by some head  shrinker, eh? No thanks, Buster. I'm  going back to my own\u2014\"\n\n\n Brett-James was shaking his head  again. \"I am afraid there is no return,  Mr. Prantera. Time travel works but  in one direction, with the flow of the  time stream. There can be no return  to your own era.\"\n\n\n Joe Prantera had been rocking  with the mental blows he had been  assimilating, but this was the final  haymaker. He was stuck in this  squaresville of a world. Joe Prantera on a job was thorough.\n\n\n Careful, painstaking, competent.\n\n\n He spent the first three days of his  life in the year 2133 getting the feel  of things. Brett-James and Reston-Farrell  had been appointed to work  with him. Joe didn't meet any of the  others who belonged to the group  which had taken the measures to  bring him from the past. He didn't  want to meet them. The fewer persons  involved, the better.\n\n\n He stayed in the apartment of  Reston-Farrell. Joe had been right,  Reston-Farrell was a medical doctor.  Brett-James evidently had something  to do with the process that had enabled  them to bring Joe from the  past. Joe didn't know how they'd  done it, and he didn't care. Joe was a  realist. He was here. The thing was  to adapt.\n\n\n There didn't seem to be any hurry.  Once the deal was made, they left it  up to him to make the decisions.\n\n\n They drove him around the town,  when he wished to check the traffic  arteries. They flew him about the  whole vicinity. From the air, Southern  California looked much the same  as it had in his own time. Oceans,  mountains, and to a lesser extent, deserts,  are fairly permanent even  against man's corroding efforts.\n\n\n It was while he was flying with  Brett-James on the second day that  Joe said, \"How about Mexico? Could  I make the get to Mexico?\"\n\n\n The physicist looked at him questioningly.  \"Get?\" he said.\n\n\n Joe Prantera said impatiently, \"The  getaway. After I give it to this Howard  Temple-Tracy guy, I gotta go on  the run, don't I?\"\n\n\n \"I see.\" Brett-James cleared his  throat. \"Mexico is no longer a separate  nation, Mr. Prantera. All North  America has been united into one  unit. Today, there are only eight nations  in the world.\"\n\n\n \"Where's the nearest?\"\n\n\n \"South America.\"\n\n\n \"That's a helluva long way to go on  a get.\"\n\n\n \"We hadn't thought of the matter  being handled in that manner.\"\n\n\n Joe eyed him in scorn. \"Oh, you  didn't, huh? What happens after I  give it to this guy? I just sit around  and wait for the cops to put the arm  on me?\"\n\n\n Brett-James grimaced in amusement.  \"Mr. Prantera, this will probably  be difficult for you to comprehend,  but there are no police in this  era.\"\n\n\n Joe gaped at him. \"No police!  What happens if you gotta throw  some guy in stir?\"\n\n\n \"If I understand your idiom correctly,  you mean prison. There are  no prisons in this era, Mr. Prantera.\"\n\n\n Joe stared. \"No cops, no jails. What  stops anybody? What stops anybody  from just going into some bank, like,  and collecting up all the bread?\"\n\n\n Brett-James cleared his throat.  \"Mr. Prantera, there are no banks.\"\n\n\n \"No banks! You gotta have banks!\"\n\n\n \"And no money to put in them.  We found it a rather antiquated  method of distribution well over a  century ago.\"\n\n\n Joe had given up. Now he merely  stared.\n\n\n Brett-James said reasonably, \"We  found we were devoting as much  time to financial matters in all their  endless ramifications\u2014including  bank robberies\u2014as we were to productive  efforts. So we turned to more  efficient methods of distribution.\" On the fourth day, Joe said, \"O.K.,  let's get down to facts. Summa the  things you guys say don't stick together  so good. Now, first place,  where's this guy Temple-Tracy you  want knocked off?\"\n\n\n Reston-Farrell and Brett-James  were both present. The three of them  sat in the living room of the latter's  apartment, sipping a sparkling wine  which seemed to be the prevailing  beverage of the day. For Joe's taste  it was insipid stuff. Happily, rye was  available to those who wanted it.\n\n\n Reston-Farrell said, \"You mean,  where does he reside? Why, here in  this city.\"\n\n\n \"Well, that's handy, eh?\" Joe  scratched himself thoughtfully. \"You  got somebody can finger him for me?\"\n\n\n \"Finger him?\"\n\n\n \"Look, before I can give it to this  guy I gotta know some place where  he'll be at some time. Get it? Like Al  Rossi. My finger, he works in Rossi's  house, see? He lets me know every  Wednesday night, eight o'clock, Al  leaves the house all by hisself. O.K.,  so I can make plans, like, to give it  to him.\" Joe Prantera wound it up  reasonably. \"You gotta have a finger.\"\n\n\n Brett-James said, \"Why not just go  to Temple-Tracy's apartment and, ah,  dispose of him?\"\n\n\n \"Jest walk in, eh? You think I'm  stupid? How do I know how many  witnesses hangin' around? How do I  know if the guy's carryin' heat?\"\n\n\n \"Heat?\"\n\n\n \"A gun, a gun. Ya think I'm stupid?  I come to give it to him and he  gives it to me instead.\"\n\n\n Dr. Reston-Farrell said, \"Howard  Temple-Tracy lives alone. He customarily  receives visitors every afternoon,  largely potential followers. He  is attempting to recruit members to  an organization he is forming. It  would be quite simple for you to  enter his establishment and dispose  of him. I assure you, he does not possess  weapons.\"\n\n\n Joe was indignant. \"Just like that,  eh?\" he said sarcastically. \"Then what  happens? How do I get out of the  building? Where's my get car parked?  Where do I hide out? Where do I  dump the heat?\"\n\n\n \"Dump the heat?\"\n\n\n \"Get rid of the gun. You want I  should get caught with the gun on  me? I'd wind up in the gas chamber  so quick\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, Mr. Prantera,\" Brett-James  said softly. \"We no longer have  capital punishment, you must realize.\"\n\n\n \"O.K. I still don't wanta get caught.  What is the rap these days, huh?\"  Joe scowled. \"You said they didn't  have no jails any more.\"\n\n\n \"This is difficult for you to understand,  I imagine,\" Reston-Farrell told  him, \"but, you see, we no longer punish  people in this era.\"\n\n\n That took a long, unbelieving moment  to sink in. \"You mean, like, no  matter what they do? That's crazy.  Everybody'd be running around giving  it to everybody else.\"\n\n\n \"The motivation for crime has  been removed, Mr. Prantera,\" Reston-Farrell  attempted to explain. \"A  person who commits a violence  against another is obviously in need  of medical care. And, consequently,  receives it.\"\n\n\n \"You mean, like, if I steal a car or  something, they just take me to a  doctor?\" Joe Prantera was unbelieving.\n\n\n \"Why would anybody wish to steal  a car?\" Reston-Farrell said easily.\n\n\n \"But if I give it to somebody?\"\n\n\n \"You will be turned over to a medical  institution. Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy  is the last man you will  ever kill, Mr. Prantera.\"\n\n\n A chillness was in the belly of Joe  Prantera. He said very slowly, very  dangerously, \"You guys figure on me  getting caught, don't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Brett-James said evenly.\n\n\n \"Well then, figure something else.  You think I'm stupid?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Prantera,\" Dr. Reston-Farrell  said, \"there has been as much progress  in the field of psychiatry in the  past two centuries as there has in  any other. Your treatment would be  brief and painless, believe me.\"\n\n\n Joe said coldly, \"And what happens  to you guys? How do you know I  won't rat on you?\"\n\n\n Brett-James said gently, \"The moment  after you have accomplished  your mission, we plan to turn ourselves  over to the nearest institution  to have determined whether or not  we also need therapy.\"\n\n\n \"Now I'm beginning to wonder  about you guys,\" Joe said. \"Look, all  over again, what'd'ya wanta give it to  this guy for?\"\n\n\n The doctor said, \"We explained  the other day, Mr. Prantera. Citizen  Howard Temple-Tracy is a dangerous,  atavistic, evil genius. We are  afraid for our institutions if his plans  are allowed to mature.\"\n\n\n \"Well if you got things so good,  everybody's got it made, like, who'd  listen to him?\"\n\n\n The doctor nodded at the validity  of the question. \"Mr. Prantera, Homo  sapiens is a unique animal. Physically  he matures at approximately the age  of thirteen. However, mental maturity  and adjustment is often not fully  realized until thirty or even more.  Indeed, it is sometimes never  achieved. Before such maturity is  reached, our youth are susceptible to  romantic appeal. Nationalism, chauvinism,  racism, the supposed glory of  the military, all seem romantic to the  immature. They rebel at the orderliness  of present society. They seek entertainment  in excitement. Citizen  Temple-Tracy is aware of this and  finds his recruits among the young.\"\n\n\n \"O.K., so this guy is dangerous.  You want him knocked off before he  screws everything up. But the way  things are, there's no way of making  a get. So you'll have to get some other  patsy. Not me.\"\n\n\n \"I am afraid you have no alternative,\"  Brett-James said gently. \"Without  us, what will you do? Mr. Prantera,  you do not even speak the language.\"\n\n\n \"What'd'ya mean? I don't understand  summa the big words you eggheads  use, but I get by O.K.\"\n\n\n Brett-James said, \"Amer-English is  no longer the language spoken by the  man in the street, Mr. Prantera. Only  students of such subjects any longer  speak such tongues as Amer-English,  French, Russian or the many others  that once confused the race with  their limitations as a means of communication.\"\n\n\n \"You mean there's no place in the  whole world where they talk American?\"  Joe demanded, aghast. Dr. Reston-Farrell controlled the  car. Joe Prantera sat in the seat next  to him and Warren Brett-James sat  in the back. Joe had, tucked in his  belt, a .45 caliber automatic, once displayed  in a museum. It had been  more easily procured than the ammunition  to fit it, but that problem too  had been solved.\n\n\n The others were nervous, obviously  repelled by the very conception of  what they had planned.\n\n\n Inwardly, Joe was amused. Now  that they had got in the clutch, the  others were on the verge of chickening  out. He knew it wouldn't have  taken much for them to cancel the  project. It wasn't any answer though.  If they allowed him to call it off today,  they'd talk themselves into it  again before the week was through.\n\n\n Besides, already Joe was beginning  to feel the comfortable, pleasurable,  warm feeling that came to him on  occasions like this.\n\n\n He said, \"You're sure this guy talks  American, eh?\"\n\n\n Warren Brett-James said, \"Quite  sure. He is a student of history.\"\n\n\n \"And he won't think it's funny I  talk American to him, eh?\"\n\n\n \"He'll undoubtedly be intrigued.\"\n\n\n They pulled up before a large  apartment building that overlooked  the area once known as Wilmington.\n\n\n Joe was coolly efficient now. He  pulled out the automatic, held it  down below his knees and threw a  shell into the barrel. He eased the  hammer down, thumbed on the  safety, stuck the weapon back in his  belt and beneath the jacketlike garment  he wore.\n\n\n He said, \"O.K. See you guys later.\"  He left them and entered the building.\n\n\n An elevator\u2014he still wasn't used  to their speed in this era\u2014whooshed  him to the penthouse duplex occupied  by Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy.\n\n\n There were two persons in the reception  room but they left on Joe's  arrival, without bothering to look at  him more than glancingly.\n\n\n He spotted the screen immediately  and went over and stood before it.\n\n\n The screen lit and revealed a  heavy-set, dour of countenance man  seated at a desk. He looked into Joe  Prantera's face, scowled and said  something.\n\n\n Joe said, \"Joseph Salviati-Prantera  to interview Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy.\"\n\n\n The other's shaggy eyebrows rose.  \"Indeed,\" he said. \"In Amer-English?\"\n\n\n Joe nodded.\n\n\n \"Enter,\" the other said.\n\n\n A door had slid open on the other  side of the room. Joe walked through  it and into what was obviously an office.  Citizen Temple-Tracy sat at a  desk. There was only one other chair  in the room. Joe Prantera ignored it  and remained standing.\n\n\n Citizen Temple-Tracy said, \"What  can I do for you?\"\n\n\n Joe looked at him for a long, long  moment. Then he reached down to  his belt and brought forth the .45  automatic. He moistened his lips.\n\n\n Joe said softly, \"You know what  this here is?\"\n\n\n Temple-Tracy stared at the weapon.  \"It's a handgun, circa, I would  say, about 1925 Old Calendar. What  in the world are you doing with it?\"\n\n\n Joe said, very slowly, \"Chief, in the  line you're in these days you needa  heavy around with wunna these. Otherwise,  Chief, you're gunna wind up  in some gutter with a lotta holes in  you. What I'm doin', I'm askin' for a  job. You need a good man knows how  to handle wunna these, Chief.\"\n\n\n Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy  eyed him appraisingly. \"Perhaps,\" he  said, \"you are right at that. In the near  future, I may well need an assistant  knowledgeable in the field of violence.  Tell me more about yourself.  You surprise me considerably.\"\n\n\n \"Sure, Chief. It's kinda a long  story, though. First off, I better tell  you you got some bad enemies, Chief.  Two guys special, named Brett-James  and Doc Reston-Farrell. I think one  of the first jobs I'm gunna hafta do  for you, Chief, is to give it to those  two.\" THE END Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Analog December  1960.
