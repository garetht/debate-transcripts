Oh, I'm A Stranger   Here Myself By MACK REYNOLDS The  Place de France is the  town's hub. It marks the end  of Boulevard Pasteur, the main  drag of the westernized part of  the city, and the beginning of  Rue de la Libert\u00e9, which leads  down to the Grand Socco and  the medina. In a three-minute  walk from the Place de France  you can go from an ultra-modern,  California-like resort to the  Baghdad of Harun al-Rashid.\n\n\n It's quite a town, Tangier.\n\n\n King-size sidewalk cafes occupy  three of the strategic  corners on the Place de France.  The Cafe de Paris serves the  best draft beer in town, gets all  the better custom, and has three  shoeshine boys attached to the  establishment. You can sit of a  sunny morning and read the  Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune while getting  your shoes done up like mirrors  for thirty Moroccan francs  which comes to about five cents  at current exchange.\n\n\n You can sit there, after the  paper's read, sip your expresso  and watch the people go by.\n\n\n Tangier is possibly the most  cosmopolitan city in the world.  In native costume you'll see  Berber and Rif, Arab and Blue  Man, and occasionally a Senegalese  from further south. In  European dress you'll see Japs  and Chinese, Hindus and Turks,  Levantines and Filipinos, North  Americans and South Americans,  and, of course, even Europeans\u2014from  both sides of the  Curtain.\n\n\n In Tangier you'll find some of  the world's poorest and some of  the richest. The poorest will try  to sell you anything from a  shoeshine to their not very lily-white  bodies, and the richest will  avoid your eyes, afraid you might try to sell them something.\n\n\n In spite of recent changes, the  town still has its unique qualities.  As a result of them the permanent  population includes  smugglers and black-marketeers,  fugitives from justice and international  con men, espionage  and counter-espionage agents,  homosexuals, nymphomaniacs, alcoholics,  drug addicts, displaced  persons, ex-royalty, and subversives  of every flavor. Local law  limits the activities of few of  these.\n\n\n Like I said, it's quite a town. I looked up from my Herald  Tribune and said, \"Hello, Paul.  Anything new cooking?\"\n\n\n He sank into the chair opposite  me and looked around for  the waiter. The tables were all  crowded and since mine was a  face he recognized, he assumed  he was welcome to intrude. It was  more or less standard procedure  at the Cafe de Paris. It wasn't  a place to go if you wanted to  be alone.\n\n\n Paul said, \"How are you,  Rupert? Haven't seen you for  donkey's years.\"\n\n\n The waiter came along and  Paul ordered a glass of beer.  Paul was an easy-going, sallow-faced  little man. I vaguely remembered  somebody saying he  was from Liverpool and in  exports.\n\n\n \"What's in the newspaper?\"  he said, disinterestedly.\n\n\n \"Pogo and Albert are going  to fight a duel,\" I told him, \"and  Lil Abner is becoming a rock'n'roll  singer.\"\n\n\n He grunted.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said, \"the intellectual  type.\" I scanned the front page.  \"The Russkies have put up  another manned satellite.\"\n\n\n \"They have, eh? How big?\"\n\n\n \"Several times bigger than  anything we Americans have.\"\n\n\n The beer came and looked  good, so I ordered a glass too.\n\n\n Paul said, \"What ever happened  to those poxy flying  saucers?\"\n\n\n \"What flying saucers?\"\n\n\n A French girl went by with a  poodle so finely clipped as to look  as though it'd been shaven. The  girl was in the latest from  Paris. Every pore in place. We  both looked after her.\n\n\n \"You know, what everybody  was seeing a few years ago. It's  too bad one of these bloody manned  satellites wasn't up then.  Maybe they would've seen one.\"\n\n\n \"That's an idea,\" I said.\n\n\n We didn't say anything else for  a while and I began to wonder  if I could go back to my paper  without rubbing him the wrong  way. I didn't know Paul very  well, but, for that matter, it's  comparatively seldom you ever  get to know anybody very well  in Tangier. Largely, cards are  played close to the chest. My beer came and a plate of  tapas for us both. Tapas at the  Cafe de Paris are apt to be  potato salad, a few anchovies,  olives, and possibly some cheese.  Free lunch, they used to call it  in the States.\n\n\n Just to say something, I said,  \"Where do you think they came  from?\" And when he looked  blank, I added, \"The Flying  Saucers.\"\n\n\n He grinned. \"From Mars or  Venus, or someplace.\"\n\n\n \"Ummmm,\" I said. \"Too bad  none of them ever crashed, or  landed on the Yale football field  and said Take me to your cheerleader ,  or something.\"\n\n\n Paul yawned and said, \"That  was always the trouble with those  crackpot blokes' explanations of  them. If they were aliens from  space, then why not show themselves?\"\n\n\n I ate one of the potato chips.  It'd been cooked in rancid olive  oil.\n\n\n I said, \"Oh, there are various  answers to that one. We could  probably sit around here and  think of two or three that made  sense.\"\n\n\n Paul was mildly interested.  \"Like what?\"\n\n\n \"Well, hell, suppose for instance  there's this big Galactic League  of civilized planets. But it's restricted,  see. You're not eligible  for membership until you, well,  say until you've developed space  flight. Then you're invited into  the club. Meanwhile, they send  secret missions down from time  to time to keep an eye on your  progress.\"\n\n\n Paul grinned at me. \"I see you  read the same poxy stuff I do.\"\n\n\n A Moorish girl went by dressed  in a neatly tailored gray  jellaba, European style high-heeled  shoes, and a pinkish silk  veil so transparent that you  could see she wore lipstick. Very  provocative, dark eyes can be  over a veil. We both looked  after her.\n\n\n I said, \"Or, here's another  one. Suppose you have a very  advanced civilization on, say,  Mars.\"\n\n\n \"Not Mars. No air, and too  bloody dry to support life.\"\n\n\n \"Don't interrupt, please,\" I  said with mock severity. \"This  is a very old civilization and as  the planet began to lose its  water and air, it withdrew underground.  Uses hydroponics and  so forth, husbands its water and  air. Isn't that what we'd do, in  a few million years, if Earth lost  its water and air?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so,\" he said. \"Anyway,  what about them?\"\n\n\n \"Well, they observe how man  is going through a scientific  boom, an industrial boom, a  population boom. A boom, period.  Any day now he's going to have  practical space ships. Meanwhile,  he's also got the H-Bomb and  the way he beats the drums on  both sides of the Curtain, he's  not against using it, if he could  get away with it.\"\n\n\n Paul said, \"I got it. So they're  scared and are keeping an eye on  us. That's an old one. I've read  that a dozen times, dished up  different.\"\n\n\n I shifted my shoulders. \"Well,  it's one possibility.\"\n\n\n \"I got a better one. How's  this. There's this alien life form  that's way ahead of us. Their  civilization is so old that they  don't have any records of when  it began and how it was in the  early days. They've gone beyond  things like wars and depressions  and revolutions, and greed for  power or any of these things  giving us a bad time here on  Earth. They're all like scholars,  get it? And some of them are  pretty jolly well taken by Earth,  especially the way we are right  now, with all the problems, get  it? Things developing so fast we  don't know where we're going  or how we're going to get there.\" I finished my beer and clapped  my hands for Mouley. \"How do  you mean, where we're going ?\"\n\n\n \"Well, take half the countries  in the world today. They're trying  to industrialize, modernize,  catch up with the advanced countries.  Look at Egypt, and Israel,  and India and China, and Yugoslavia  and Brazil, and all the  rest. Trying to drag themselves  up to the level of the advanced  countries, and all using different  methods of doing it. But look  at the so-called advanced countries.  Up to their bottoms in  problems. Juvenile delinquents,  climbing crime and suicide rates,  the loony-bins full of the balmy,  unemployed, threat of war,  spending all their money on armaments  instead of things like  schools. All the bloody mess of  it. Why, a man from Mars would  be fascinated, like.\"\n\n\n Mouley came shuffling up in  his babouche slippers and we  both ordered another schooner  of beer.\n\n\n Paul said seriously, \"You  know, there's only one big snag  in this sort of talk. I've sorted  the whole thing out before, and  you always come up against this  brick wall. Where are they, these  observers, or scholars, or spies  or whatever they are? Sooner  or later we'd nab one of them.  You know, Scotland Yard, or  the F.B.I., or Russia's secret  police, or the French S\u00fbret\u00e9, or  Interpol. This world is so deep  in police, counter-espionage outfits  and security agents that an  alien would slip up in time, no  matter how much he'd been  trained. Sooner or later, he'd slip  up, and they'd nab him.\"\n\n\n I shook my head. \"Not necessarily.  The first time I ever considered  this possibility, it seemed  to me that such an alien would  base himself in London or New  York. Somewhere where he could  use the libraries for research,  get the daily newspapers and  the magazines. Be right in the  center of things. But now I don't  think so. I think he'd be right  here in Tangier.\"\n\n\n \"Why Tangier?\"\n\n\n \"It's the one town in the world  where anything goes. Nobody  gives a damn about you or your  affairs. For instance, I've known  you a year or more now, and I  haven't the slightest idea of how  you make your living.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Paul admitted.  \"In this town you seldom even  ask a man where's he's from. He  can be British, a White Russian,  a Basque or a Sikh and nobody  could care less. Where are you from, Rupert?\"\n\n\n \"California,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"No, you're not,\" he grinned.\n\n\n I was taken aback. \"What do  you mean?\"\n\n\n \"I felt your mind probe back  a few minutes ago when I was  talking about Scotland Yard or  the F.B.I. possibly flushing an  alien. Telepathy is a sense not  trained by the humanoids. If  they had it, your job\u2014and mine\u2014would  be considerably more  difficult. Let's face it, in spite of  these human bodies we're disguised  in, neither of us is  humanoid. Where are you really  from, Rupert?\"\n\n\n \"Aldebaran,\" I said. \"How  about you?\"\n\n\n \"Deneb,\" he told me, shaking.\n\n\n We had a laugh and ordered  another beer.\n\n\n \"What're you doing here on  Earth?\" I asked him.\n\n\n \"Researching for one of our  meat trusts. We're protein  eaters. Humanoid flesh is considered  quite a delicacy. How  about you?\"\n\n\n \"Scouting the place for thrill  tourists. My job is to go around  to these backward cultures and  help stir up inter-tribal, or international,  conflicts\u2014all according  to how advanced they  are. Then our tourists come in\u2014well  shielded, of course\u2014and get  their kicks watching it.\"\n\n\n Paul frowned. \"That sort of  practice could spoil an awful  lot of good meat.\" THE END Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Amazing Stories December 1960.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds.

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

For instance, I've known  you a year or more now, and I  haven't the slightest idea of how  you make your living.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Paul admitted.  \"In this town you seldom even  ask a man where's he's from. He  can be British, a White Russian,  a Basque or a Sikh and nobody  could care less. Where are you from, Rupert?\"\n\n\n \"California,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"No, you're not,\" he grinned.\n\n\n I was taken aback. \"What do  you mean?\"\n\n\n \"I felt your mind probe back  a few minutes ago when I was  talking about Scotland Yard or  the F.B.I. possibly flushing an  alien. Telepathy is a sense not  trained by the humanoids. If  they had it, your job\u2014and mine\u2014would  be considerably more  difficult.

They're all     weirdies of one kind or another.     Me? Oh, I'm A Stranger   Here Myself By MACK REYNOLDS The  Place de France is the  town's hub. It marks the end  of Boulevard Pasteur, the main  drag of the westernized part of  the city, and the beginning of  Rue de la Libert\u00e9, which leads  down to the Grand Socco and  the medina. In a three-minute  walk from the Place de France  you can go from an ultra-modern,  California-like resort to the  Baghdad of Harun al-Rashid.\n\n\n It's quite a town, Tangier.\n\n\n King-size sidewalk cafes occupy  three of the strategic  corners on the Place de France.  The Cafe de Paris serves the  best draft beer in town, gets all  the better custom, and has three  shoeshine boys attached to the  establishment. You can sit of a  sunny morning and read the  Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune while getting  your shoes done up like mirrors  for thirty Moroccan francs  which comes to about five cents  at current exchange.\n\n\n You can sit there, after the  paper's read, sip your expresso  and watch the people go by.\n\n\n Tangier is possibly the most  cosmopolitan city in the world.  In native costume you'll see  Berber and Rif, Arab and Blue  Man, and occasionally a Senegalese  from further south. In  European dress you'll see Japs  and Chinese, Hindus and Turks,  Levantines and Filipinos, North  Americans and South Americans,  and, of course, even Europeans\u2014from  both sides of the  Curtain.\n\n\n In Tangier you'll find some of  the world's poorest and some of  the richest. The poorest will try  to sell you anything from a  shoeshine to their not very lily-white  bodies, and the richest will  avoid your eyes, afraid you might try to sell them something.\n\n\n In spite of recent changes, the  town still has its unique qualities.  As a result of them the permanent  population includes  smugglers and black-marketeers,  fugitives from justice and international  con men, espionage  and counter-espionage agents,  homosexuals, nymphomaniacs, alcoholics,  drug addicts, displaced  persons, ex-royalty, and subversives  of every flavor. Local law  limits the activities of few of  these.\n\n\n Like I said, it's quite a town. I looked up from my Herald  Tribune and said, \"Hello, Paul.  Anything new cooking?\"\n\n\n He sank into the chair opposite  me and looked around for  the waiter. The tables were all  crowded and since mine was a  face he recognized, he assumed  he was welcome to intrude. It was  more or less standard procedure  at the Cafe de Paris. It wasn't  a place to go if you wanted to  be alone.\n\n\n Paul said, \"How are you,  Rupert? Haven't seen you for  donkey's years.\"\n\n\n The waiter came along and  Paul ordered a glass of beer.  Paul was an easy-going, sallow-faced  little man. I vaguely remembered  somebody saying he  was from Liverpool and in  exports.\n\n\n \"What's in the newspaper?\"  he said, disinterestedly.\n\n\n \"Pogo and Albert are going  to fight a duel,\" I told him, \"and  Lil Abner is becoming a rock'n'roll  singer.\"\n\n\n He grunted.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said, \"the intellectual  type.\" I scanned the front page.  \"The Russkies have put up  another manned satellite.\"\n\n\n \"They have, eh? How big?\"\n\n\n \"Several times bigger than  anything we Americans have.\"\n\n\n The beer came and looked  good, so I ordered a glass too.\n\n\n Paul said, \"What ever happened  to those poxy flying  saucers?\"\n\n\n \"What flying saucers?\"\n\n\n A French girl went by with a  poodle so finely clipped as to look  as though it'd been shaven. The  girl was in the latest from  Paris. Every pore in place. We  both looked after her.\n\n\n \"You know, what everybody  was seeing a few years ago. It's  too bad one of these bloody manned  satellites wasn't up then.  Maybe they would've seen one.\"\n\n\n \"That's an idea,\" I said.\n\n\n We didn't say anything else for  a while and I began to wonder  if I could go back to my paper  without rubbing him the wrong  way. I didn't know Paul very  well, but, for that matter, it's  comparatively seldom you ever  get to know anybody very well  in Tangier. Largely, cards are  played close to the chest. My beer came and a plate of  tapas for us both. Tapas at the  Cafe de Paris are apt to be  potato salad, a few anchovies,  olives, and possibly some cheese.  Free lunch, they used to call it  in the States.\n\n\n Just to say something, I said,  \"Where do you think they came  from?\" And when he looked  blank, I added, \"The Flying  Saucers.\"\n\n\n He grinned. \"From Mars or  Venus, or someplace.\"\n\n\n \"Ummmm,\" I said. \"Too bad  none of them ever crashed, or  landed on the Yale football field  and said Take me to your cheerleader ,  or something.\"\n\n\n Paul yawned and said, \"That  was always the trouble with those  crackpot blokes' explanations of  them. If they were aliens from  space, then why not show themselves?\"\n\n\n I ate one of the potato chips.  It'd been cooked in rancid olive  oil.\n\n\n I said, \"Oh, there are various  answers to that one. We could  probably sit around here and  think of two or three that made  sense.\"\n\n\n Paul was mildly interested.  \"Like what?\"\n\n\n \"Well, hell, suppose for instance  there's this big Galactic League  of civilized planets. But it's restricted,  see. You're not eligible  for membership until you, well,  say until you've developed space  flight. Then you're invited into  the club. Meanwhile, they send  secret missions down from time  to time to keep an eye on your  progress.\"\n\n\n Paul grinned at me. \"I see you  read the same poxy stuff I do.\"\n\n\n A Moorish girl went by dressed  in a neatly tailored gray  jellaba, European style high-heeled  shoes, and a pinkish silk  veil so transparent that you  could see she wore lipstick. Very  provocative, dark eyes can be  over a veil. We both looked  after her.\n\n\n I said, \"Or, here's another  one. Suppose you have a very  advanced civilization on, say,  Mars.\"\n\n\n \"Not Mars. No air, and too  bloody dry to support life.\"\n\n\n \"Don't interrupt, please,\" I  said with mock severity. \"This  is a very old civilization and as  the planet began to lose its  water and air, it withdrew underground.  Uses hydroponics and  so forth, husbands its water and  air. Isn't that what we'd do, in  a few million years, if Earth lost  its water and air?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so,\" he said. \"Anyway,  what about them?\"\n\n\n \"Well, they observe how man  is going through a scientific  boom, an industrial boom, a  population boom. A boom, period.  Any day now he's going to have  practical space ships. Meanwhile,  he's also got the H-Bomb and  the way he beats the drums on  both sides of the Curtain, he's  not against using it, if he could  get away with it.\"\n\n\n Paul said, \"I got it. So they're  scared and are keeping an eye on  us. That's an old one. I've read  that a dozen times, dished up  different.\"\n\n\n I shifted my shoulders. \"Well,  it's one possibility.\"\n\n\n \"I got a better one. How's  this. There's this alien life form  that's way ahead of us. Their  civilization is so old that they  don't have any records of when  it began and how it was in the  early days. They've gone beyond  things like wars and depressions  and revolutions, and greed for  power or any of these things  giving us a bad time here on  Earth. They're all like scholars,  get it? And some of them are  pretty jolly well taken by Earth,  especially the way we are right  now, with all the problems, get  it? Things developing so fast we  don't know where we're going  or how we're going to get there.\" I finished my beer and clapped  my hands for Mouley. \"How do  you mean, where we're going ?\"\n\n\n \"Well, take half the countries  in the world today. They're trying  to industrialize, modernize,  catch up with the advanced countries.  Look at Egypt, and Israel,  and India and China, and Yugoslavia  and Brazil, and all the  rest. Trying to drag themselves  up to the level of the advanced  countries, and all using different  methods of doing it. But look  at the so-called advanced countries.  Up to their bottoms in  problems. Juvenile delinquents,  climbing crime and suicide rates,  the loony-bins full of the balmy,  unemployed, threat of war,  spending all their money on armaments  instead of things like  schools. All the bloody mess of  it. Why, a man from Mars would  be fascinated, like.\"\n\n\n Mouley came shuffling up in  his babouche slippers and we  both ordered another schooner  of beer.\n\n\n Paul said seriously, \"You  know, there's only one big snag  in this sort of talk. I've sorted  the whole thing out before, and  you always come up against this  brick wall. Where are they, these  observers, or scholars, or spies  or whatever they are? Sooner  or later we'd nab one of them.  You know, Scotland Yard, or  the F.B.I., or Russia's secret  police, or the French S\u00fbret\u00e9, or  Interpol. This world is so deep  in police, counter-espionage outfits  and security agents that an  alien would slip up in time, no  matter how much he'd been  trained. Sooner or later, he'd slip  up, and they'd nab him.\"\n\n\n I shook my head. \"Not necessarily.  The first time I ever considered  this possibility, it seemed  to me that such an alien would  base himself in London or New  York. Somewhere where he could  use the libraries for research,  get the daily newspapers and  the magazines. Be right in the  center of things. But now I don't  think so. I think he'd be right  here in Tangier.\"\n\n\n \"Why Tangier?\"\n\n\n \"It's the one town in the world  where anything goes. Nobody  gives a damn about you or your  affairs. For instance, I've known  you a year or more now, and I  haven't the slightest idea of how  you make your living.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Paul admitted.  \"In this town you seldom even  ask a man where's he's from.
