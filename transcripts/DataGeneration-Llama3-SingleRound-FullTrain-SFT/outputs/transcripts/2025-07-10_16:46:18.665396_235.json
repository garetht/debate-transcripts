SMITH\n\n\n Illustrated by DILLON\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction August 1957.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] No one, least of all Martin, could dispute   that a man's life should be guarded by his   kin\u2014but by those who hadn't been born yet? Nobody in the neighborhood was surprised when Martin's mother  disappeared and Ninian came to take care of him. Mothers had a way  of disappearing around those parts and the kids were often better  off without them. Martin was no exception. He'd never had it this  good while he was living with his old lady. As for his father, Martin  had never had one. He'd been a war baby, born of one of the tides of  soldiers\u2014enemies and allies, both\u2014that had engulfed the country in  successive waves and bought or taken the women. So there was no trouble  that way.\n\n\n Sometimes he wondered who Ninian really was. Obviously that story  about her coming from the future was just a gag. Besides, if she really  was his great-great-grand-daughter, as she said, why would she tell  him to call her \" Aunt Ninian \"? Maybe he was only eleven, but he'd  been around and he knew just what the score was. At first he'd thought  maybe she was some new kind of social worker, but she acted a little  too crazy for that.\n\n\n He loved to bait her, as he had loved to bait his mother. It was safer  with Ninian, though, because when he pushed her too far, she would cry  instead of mopping up the floor with him.\n\n\n \"But I can't understand,\" he would say, keeping his face straight. \"Why  do you have to come from the future to protect me against your cousin  Conrad?\"\n\n\n \"Because he's coming to kill you.\"\n\n\n \"Why should he kill me? I ain't done him nothing.\"\n\n\n Ninian sighed. \"He's dissatisfied with the current social order and  killing you is part of an elaborate plan he's formulated to change it.  You wouldn't understand.\"\n\n\n \"You're damn right. I don't understand. What's it all about in  straight gas?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, just don't ask any questions,\" Ninian said petulantly. \"When you  get older, someone will explain the whole thing to you.\" So Martin held his peace, because, on the whole, he liked things the  way they were. Ninian really was the limit, though. All the people he  knew lived in scabrous tenement apartments like his, but she seemed to  think it was disgusting.\n\n\n \"So if you don't like it, clean it up,\" he suggested.\n\n\n She looked at him as if he were out of his mind.\n\n\n \"Hire a maid, then!\" he jeered.\n\n\n And darned if that dope didn't go out and get a woman to come clean up  the place! He was so embarrassed, he didn't even dare show his face in  the streets\u2014especially with the women buttonholing him and demanding  to know what gave. They tried talking to Ninian, but she certainly knew  how to give them the cold shoulder.\n\n\n One day the truant officer came to ask why Martin hadn't been coming  to school. Very few of the neighborhood kids attended classes very  regularly, so this was just routine. But Ninian didn't know that and  she went into a real tizzy, babbling that Martin had been sick and  would make up the work. Martin nearly did get sick from laughing so  hard inside.\n\n\n But he laughed out of the other side of his mouth when she went out and  hired a private tutor for him. A tutor\u2014in that neighborhood! Martin  had to beat up every kid on the block before he could walk a step  without hearing \"Fancy Pants!\" yelled after him.\n\n\n Ninian worried all the time. It wasn't that she cared what these people  thought of her, for she made no secret of regarding them as little  better than animals, but she was shy of attracting attention. There  were an awful lot of people in that neighborhood who felt exactly the  same way, only she didn't know that, either. She was really pretty  dumb, Martin thought, for all her fancy lingo.\n\n\n \"It's so hard to think these things out without any prior practical  application to go by,\" she told him.\n\n\n He nodded, knowing what she meant was that everything was coming out  wrong. But he didn't try to help her; he just watched to see what  she'd do next. Already he had begun to assume the detached role of a  spectator.\n\n\n When it became clear that his mother was never going to show up again,  Ninian bought one of those smallish, almost identical houses that  mushroom on the fringes of a city after every war, particularly where  intensive bombing has created a number of desirable building sites.\n\n\n \"This is a much better neighborhood for a boy to grow up in,\" she  declared. \"Besides, it's easier to keep an eye on you here.\"\n\n\n And keep an eye on him she did\u2014she or a rather foppish young man who  came to stay with them occasionally. Martin was told to call him Uncle  Raymond.\n\n\n From time to time, there were other visitors\u2014Uncles Ives and  Bartholomew and Olaf, Aunts Ottillie and Grania and Lalage, and many  more\u2014all cousins to one another, he was told, all descendants of his. Martin was never left alone for a minute. He wasn't allowed to play  with the other kids in the new neighborhood. Not that their parents  would have let them, anyway. The adults obviously figured that if  a one-car family hired private tutors for their kid, there must be  something pretty wrong with him. So Martin and Ninian were just as  conspicuous as before. But he didn't tip her off. She was grown up; she  was supposed to know better than he did.\n\n\n He lived well. He had food to eat that he'd never dreamed of before,  warm clothes that no one had ever worn before him. He was surrounded by  more luxury than he knew what to do with.\n\n\n The furniture was the latest New Grand Rapids African modern. There  were tidy, colorful Picasso and Braque prints on the walls. And every  inch of the floor was modestly covered by carpeting, though the walls  were mostly unabashed glass. There were hot water and heat all the time  and a freezer well stocked with food\u2014somewhat erratically chosen, for  Ninian didn't know much about meals.\n\n\n The non-glass part of the house was of neat, natural-toned wood, with a  neat green lawn in front and a neat parti-colored garden in back.\n\n\n Martin missed the old neighborhood, though. He missed having other  kids to play with. He even missed his mother. Sure, she hadn't given  him enough to eat and she'd beaten him up so hard sometimes that she'd  nearly killed him\u2014but then there had also been times when she'd hugged  and kissed him and soaked his collar with her tears. She'd done all  she could for him, supporting him in the only way she knew how\u2014and if  respectable society didn't like it, the hell with respectable society.\n\n\n From Ninian and her cousins, there was only an impersonal kindness.  They made no bones about the fact that they were there only to carry  out a rather unpleasant duty. Though they were in the house with him,  in their minds and in their talk they were living in another world\u2014a  world of warmth and peace and plenty where nobody worked, except in the  government service or the essential professions. And they seemed to  think even that kind of job was pretty low-class, though better than  actually doing anything with the hands.\n\n\n In their world, Martin came to understand, nobody worked with hands;  everything was done by machinery. All the people ever did was wear  pretty clothes and have good times and eat all they wanted. There was  no devastation, no war, no unhappiness, none of the concomitants of  normal living.\n\n\n It was then that Martin began to realize that either the whole lot of  them were insane, or what Ninian had told him at first was the truth.  They came from the future. When Martin was sixteen, Raymond took him aside for the talk Ninian had  promised five years before.\n\n\n \"The whole thing's all my brother Conrad's fault. You see, he's an  idealist,\" Raymond explained, pronouncing the last word with distaste.\n\n\n Martin nodded gravely. He was a quiet boy now, his brief past a dim and  rather ridiculous memory. Who could ever imagine him robbing a grocery  store or wielding a broken bottle now? He still was rather undersized  and he'd read so much that he'd weakened his eyes and had to wear  glasses. His face was pallid, because he spent little time in the sun,  and his speech rather overbred, his mentors from the future having  carefully eradicated all current vulgarities.\n\n\n \"And Conrad really got upset over the way Earth has been exploiting  the not so intelligent life-forms on the other planets,\" Raymond  continued. \"Which is distressing\u2014though, of course, it's not as  if they were people. Besides, the government has been talking about  passing laws to do away with the\u2014well, abuses and things like that,  and I'm sure someday everything will come out all right. However,  Conrad is so impatient.\"\n\n\n \"I thought, in your world, machines did all the work,\" Martin suggested.\n\n\n \"I've told you\u2014our world is precisely the same as this one!\" Raymond  snapped. \"We just come a couple of centuries or so later, that's all.  But remember, our interests are identical. We're virtually the same  people ... although it is amazing what a difference two hundred odd  years of progress and polish can make in a species, isn't it?\"\n\n\n He continued more mildly: \"However, even you ought to be able to  understand that we can't make machinery without metal. We need food.  All that sort of thing comes from the out-system planets. And, on those  worlds, it's far cheaper to use native labor than to ship out all that  expensive machinery. After all, if we didn't give the natives jobs, how  would they manage to live?\"\n\n\n \"How did they live before? Come to think of it, if you don't work, how  do you live now?... I don't mean in the now for me, but the now for  you,\" Martin explained laboriously. It was so difficult to live in the  past and think in the future.\n\n\n \"I'm trying to talk to you as if you were an adult,\" Raymond said, \"but  if you will persist in these childish interruptions\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry,\" Martin said.\n\n\n But he wasn't, for by now he had little respect left for any of  his descendants. They were all exceedingly handsome and cultivated  young people, with superior educations, smooth ways of speaking and  considerable self-confidence, but they just weren't very bright. And  he had discovered that Raymond was perhaps the most intelligent of the  lot. Somewhere in that relatively short span of time, his line or\u2014more  frightening\u2014his race had lost something vital.\n\n\n Unaware of the near-contempt in which his young ancestor held him,  Raymond went on blandly: \"Anyhow, Conrad took it upon himself to  feel particularly guilty, because, he decided, if it hadn't been for  the fact that our great-grandfather discovered the super-drive, we  might never have reached the stars. Which is ridiculous\u2014his feeling  guilty, I mean. Perhaps a great-grandfather is responsible for his  great-grandchildren, but a great-grandchild can hardly be held  accountable for his great-grandfather.\"\n\n\n \"How about a great-great-grandchild?\" Martin couldn't help asking. Raymond flushed a delicate pink. \"Do you want to hear the rest of this  or don't you?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I do!\" Martin said. He had pieced the whole thing together for  himself long since, but he wanted to hear how Raymond would put it.\n\n\n \"Unfortunately, Professor Farkas has just perfected the time  transmitter. Those government scientists are so infernally  officious\u2014always inventing such senseless things. It's supposed to  be hush-hush, but you know how news will leak out when one is always  desperate for a fresh topic of conversation.\"\n\n\n Anyhow, Raymond went on to explain, Conrad had bribed one of Farkas'  assistants for a set of the plans. Conrad's idea had been to go back  in time and \"eliminate!\" their common great-grandfather. In that way,  there would be no space-drive, and, hence, the Terrestrials would never  get to the other planets and oppress the local aborigines.\n\n\n \"Sounds like a good way of dealing with the problem,\" Martin observed.\n\n\n Raymond looked annoyed. \"It's the adolescent way,\" he said, \"to do  away with it, rather than find a solution. Would you destroy a whole  society in order to root out a single injustice?\"\n\n\n \"Not if it were a good one otherwise.\"\n\n\n \"Well, there's your answer. Conrad got the apparatus built, or perhaps  he built it himself. One doesn't inquire too closely into such  matters. But when it came to the point, Conrad couldn't bear the idea  of eliminating our great-grandfather\u2014because our great-grandfather  was such a good man, you know.\" Raymond's expressive upper lip  curled. \"So Conrad decided to go further back still and get rid of  his great-grandfather's father\u2014who'd been, by all accounts, a pretty  worthless character.\"\n\n\n \"That would be me, I suppose,\" Martin said quietly.\n\n\n Raymond turned a deep rose. \"Well, doesn't that just go to prove you  mustn't believe everything you hear?\" The next sentence tumbled out in  a rush. \"I wormed the whole thing out of him and all of us\u2014the other  cousins and me\u2014held a council of war, as it were, and we decided it  was our moral duty to go back in time ourselves and protect you.\" He  beamed at Martin.\n\n\n The boy smiled slowly. \"Of course. You had to. If Conrad succeeded in eliminating me, then none of you would exist, would you?\"\n\n\n Raymond frowned. Then he shrugged cheerfully. \"Well, you didn't really  suppose we were going to all this trouble and expense out of sheer  altruism, did you?\" he asked, turning on the charm which all the  cousins possessed to a consternating degree. Martin had, of course, no illusions on that score; he had learned long  ago that nobody did anything for nothing. But saying so was unwise.\n\n\n \"We bribed another set of plans out of another of the professor's  assistants,\" Raymond continued, as if Martin had answered,  \"and\u2014ah\u2014induced a handicraft enthusiast to build the gadget for us.\" Induced , Martin knew, could have meant anything from blackmail to the  use of the iron maiden.\n\n\n \"Then we were all ready to forestall Conrad. If one of us guarded you  night and day, he would never be able to carry out his plot. So we made  our counter-plan, set the machine as far back as it would go\u2014and here  we are!\"\n\n\n \"I see,\" Martin said.\n\n\n Raymond didn't seem to think he really did. \"After all,\" he pointed  out defensively, \"whatever our motives, it has turned into a good  thing for you. Nice home, cultured companions, all the contemporary  conveniences, plus some handy anachronisms\u2014I don't see what more you  could ask for. You're getting the best of all possible worlds. Of  course Ninian was a ninny to locate in a mercantile suburb where any  little thing out of the way will cause talk. How thankful I am that our  era has completely disposed of the mercantiles\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What did you do with them?\" Martin asked.\n\n\n But Raymond rushed on: \"Soon as Ninian goes and I'm in full charge,  we'll get a more isolated place and run it on a far grander scale.  Ostentation\u2014that's the way to live here and now; the richer you are,  the more eccentricity you can get away with. And,\" he added, \"I might  as well be as comfortable as possible while I suffer through this  wretched historical stint.\"\n\n\n \"So Ninian's going,\" said Martin, wondering why the news made him feel  curiously desolate. Because, although he supposed he liked her in a  remote kind of way, he had no fondness for her\u2014or she, he knew, for  him.\n\n\n \"Well, five years is rather a long stretch for any girl to spend in  exile,\" Raymond explained, \"even though our life spans are a bit longer  than yours. Besides, you're getting too old now to be under petticoat  government.\" He looked inquisitively at Martin. \"You're not going to  go all weepy and make a scene when she leaves, are you?\"\n\n\n \"No....\" Martin said hesitantly. \"Oh, I suppose I will miss her. But we  aren't very close, so it won't make a real difference.\" That was the  sad part: he already knew it wouldn't make a difference.\n\n\n Raymond clapped him on the shoulder. \"I knew you weren't a sloppy  sentimentalist like Conrad. Though you do have rather a look of him,  you know.\"\n\n\n Suddenly that seemed to make Conrad real. Martin felt a vague stirring  of alarm. He kept his voice composed, however. \"How do you plan to  protect me when he comes?\"\n\n\n \"Well, each one of us is armed to the teeth, of course,\" Raymond said  with modest pride, displaying something that looked like a child's  combination spaceman's gun and death ray, but which, Martin had no  doubt, was a perfectly genuine\u2014and lethal\u2014weapon. \"And we've got a  rather elaborate burglar alarm system.\"\n\n\n Martin inspected the system and made one or two changes in the wiring  which, he felt, would increase its efficiency. But still he was  dubious. \"Maybe it'll work on someone coming from outside this house ,  but do you think it will work on someone coming from outside this time ?\"\n\n\n \"Never fear\u2014it has a temporal radius,\" Raymond replied. \"Factory  guarantee and all that.\"\n\n\n \"Just to be on the safe side,\" Martin said, \"I think I'd better have  one of those guns, too.\"\n\n\n \"A splendid idea!\" enthused Raymond. \"I was just about to think of that  myself!\" When it came time for the parting, it was Ninian who cried\u2014tears at  her own inadequacy, Martin knew, not of sorrow. He was getting skillful  at understanding his descendants, far better than they at understanding  him. But then they never really tried. Ninian kissed him wetly on the  cheek and said she was sure everything would work out all right and  that she'd come see him again. She never did, though, except at the  very last.\n\n\n Raymond and Martin moved into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. The  site proved a well-chosen one; when the Second Atomic War came, half a  dozen years later, they weren't touched. Martin was never sure whether  this had been sheer luck or expert planning. Probably luck, because his  descendants were exceedingly inept planners.\n\n\n Few people in the world then could afford to live as stylishly as  Martin and his guardian. The place not only contained every possible  convenience and gadget but was crammed with bibelots and antiques,  carefully chosen by Raymond and disputed by Martin, for, to the man  from the future, all available artifacts were antiques. Otherwise,  Martin accepted his new surroundings. His sense of wonder had become  dulled by now and the pink pseudo-Spanish castle\u2014\"architecturally  dreadful, of course,\" Raymond had said, \"but so hilariously  typical\"\u2014impressed him far less than had the suburban split-level  aquarium.\n\n\n \"How about a moat?\" Martin suggested when they first came. \"It seems to  go with a castle.\" \"Do you think a moat could stop Conrad?\" Raymond asked, amused.\n\n\n \"No,\" Martin smiled, feeling rather silly, \"but it would make the place  seem safer somehow.\"\n\n\n The threat of Conrad was beginning to make him grow more and more  nervous. He got Raymond's permission to take two suits of armor that  stood in the front hall and present them to a local museum, because  several times he fancied he saw them move. He also became an adept with  the ray gun and changed the surrounding landscape quite a bit with it,  until Raymond warned that this might lead Conrad to them.\n\n\n During those early years, Martin's tutors were exchanged for the  higher-degreed ones that were now needful. The question inevitably  arose of what the youth's vocation in that life was going to be. At  least twenty of the cousins came back through time to hold one of  their vigorous family councils. Martin was still young enough to enjoy  such occasions, finding them vastly superior to all other forms of  entertainment. \"This sort of problem wouldn't arise in our day, Martin,\" Raymond  commented as he took his place at the head of the table, \"because,  unless one specifically feels a call to some profession or other, one  just\u2014well, drifts along happily.\"\n\n\n \"Ours is a wonderful world,\" Grania sighed at Martin. \"I only wish we  could take you there. I'm sure you would like it.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Grania!\" Raymond snapped. \"Well, Martin, have you  made up your mind what you want to be?\"\n\n\n Martin affected to think. \"A physicist,\" he said, not without malice.  \"Or perhaps an engineer.\"\n\n\n There was a loud, excited chorus of dissent. He chuckled inwardly.\n\n\n \"Can't do that,\" Ives said. \"Might pick up some concepts from us. Don't  know how; none of us knows a thing about science. But it could happen.  Subconscious osmosis, if there is such a thing. That way, you might  invent something ahead of time. And the fellow we got the plans from  particularly cautioned us against that. Changing history. Dangerous.\"\n\n\n \"Might mess up our time frightfully,\" Bartholomew contributed, \"though,  to be perfectly frank, I can't quite understand how.\"\n\n\n \"I am not going to sit down and explain the whole thing to you all over  again, Bart!\" Raymond said impatiently. \"Well, Martin?\"\n\n\n \"What would you suggest?\" Martin asked.\n\n\n \"How about becoming a painter? Art is eternal. And quite gentlemanly.  Besides, artists are always expected to be either behind or ahead of  their times.\"\n\n\n \"Furthermore,\" Ottillie added, \"one more artist couldn't make much  difference in history. There were so many of them all through the ages.\"\n\n\n Martin couldn't hold back his question. \"What was I, actually, in that  other time?\"\n\n\n There was a chilly silence.\n\n\n \"Let's not talk about it, dear,\" Lalage finally said. \"Let's just be  thankful we've saved you from that !\"\n\n\n So drawing teachers were engaged and Martin became a very competent  second-rate artist. He knew he would never be able to achieve first  rank because, even though he was still so young, his work was almost  purely intellectual. The only emotion he seemed able to feel was  fear\u2014the ever-present fear that someday he would turn a corridor and  walk into a man who looked like him\u2014a man who wanted to kill him for  the sake of an ideal.\n\n\n But the fear did not show in Martin's pictures. They were pretty  pictures. Cousin Ives\u2014now that Martin was older, he was told to call the  descendants cousin \u2014next assumed guardianship. Ives took his  responsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arranged  to have Martin's work shown at an art gallery. The paintings received  critical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm. The modest  sale they enjoyed was mostly to interior decorators. Museums were not  interested.\n\n\n \"Takes time,\" Ives tried to reassure him. \"One day they'll be buying  your pictures, Martin. Wait and see.\"\n\n\n Ives was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martin  as an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other young  man failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was a  change of air and scenery.\n\n\n \"'Course you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't invented  space travel yet. But we can go see this world. What's left of it.  Tourists always like ruins best, anyway.\"\n\n\n So he drew on the family's vast future resources and bought a yacht,  which Martin christened The Interregnum . They traveled about from sea  to ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and making  trips inland. Martin saw the civilized world\u2014mostly in fragments; the  nearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much the  same as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormous  museum; he couldn't seem to identify with his own time any more.\n\n\n The other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters,  largely because they could spend so much time far away from the  contemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. So  they never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on The Interregnum . He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, although  there was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler through  time.\n\n\n More cousins were in residence at once than ever before, because  they came for the ocean voyage. They spent most of their time aboard  ship, giving each other parties and playing an avant-garde form of  shuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usually  ended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another of  having got advance information about the results.\n\n\n Martin didn't care much for their company and associated with them only  when not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, though  they were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn't court  his society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable. He rather liked Ives, though. Sometimes the two of them would be alone  together; then Ives would tell Martin of the future world he had come  from. The picture drawn by Raymond and Ninian had not been entirely  accurate, Ives admitted. True, there was no war or poverty on Earth  proper, but that was because there were only a couple of million people  left on the planet. It was an enclave for the highly privileged, highly  interbred aristocracy, to which Martin's descendants belonged by virtue  of their distinguished ancestry.\n\n\n \"Rather feudal, isn't it?\" Martin asked.\n\n\n Ives agreed, adding that the system had, however, been deliberately  planned, rather than the result of haphazard natural development.  Everything potentially unpleasant, like the mercantiles, had been  deported.\n\n\n \"Not only natives livin' on the other worlds,\" Ives said as the two  of them stood at the ship's rail, surrounded by the limitless expanse  of some ocean or other. \"People, too. Mostly lower classes, except  for officials and things. With wars and want and suffering,\" he added  regretfully, \"same as in your day.... Like now, I mean,\" he corrected  himself. \"Maybe it is worse, the way Conrad thinks. More planets  for us to make trouble on. Three that were habitable aren't any more.  Bombed. Very thorough job.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" Martin murmured, trying to sound shocked, horrified\u2014interested,  even.\n\n\n \"Sometimes I'm not altogether sure Conrad was wrong,\" Ives said, after  a pause. \"Tried to keep us from getting to the stars, hurting the  people\u2014I expect you could call them people\u2014there. Still\u2014\" he smiled  shamefacedly\u2014\"couldn't stand by and see my own way of life destroyed,  could I?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose not,\" Martin said.\n\n\n \"Would take moral courage. I don't have it. None of us does, except  Conrad, and even he\u2014\" Ives looked out over the sea. \"Must be a better  way out than Conrad's,\" he said without conviction. \"And everything  will work out all right in the end. Bound to. No sense to\u2014to anything,  if it doesn't.\" He glanced wistfully at Martin.\n\n\n \"I hope so,\" said Martin. But he couldn't hope; he couldn't feel; he  couldn't even seem to care.\n\n\n During all this time, Conrad still did not put in an appearance. Martin  had gotten to be such a crack shot with the ray pistol that he almost  wished his descendant would show up, so there would be some excitement.  But he didn't come. And Martin got to thinking....\n\n\n He always felt that if any of the cousins could have come to realize  the basic flaw in the elaborate plan they had concocted, it would have  been Ives. However, when the yacht touched at Tierra del Fuego one  bitter winter, Ives took a severe chill. They sent for a doctor from  the future\u2014one of the descendants who had been eccentric enough to  take a medical degree\u2014but he wasn't able to save Ives. The body was  buried in the frozen ground at Ushuaia, on the southern tip of the  continent, a hundred years or more before the date of his birth.\n\n\n A great many of the cousins turned up at the simple ceremony. All were  dressed in overwhelming black and showed a great deal of grief. Raymond  read the burial service, because they didn't dare summon a clerical  cousin from the future; they were afraid he might prove rather stuffy  about the entire undertaking.\n\n\n \"He died for all of us,\" Raymond concluded his funeral eulogy over  Ives, \"so his death was not in vain.\"\n\n\n But Martin disagreed. The ceaseless voyaging began again. The Interregnum voyaged to every  ocean and every sea. Some were blue and some green and some dun. After  a while, Martin couldn't tell one from another. Cousin after cousin  came to watch over him and eventually they were as hard for him to tell  apart as the different oceans. All the cousins were young, for, though they came at different times in  his life, they had all started out from the same time in theirs. Only  the young ones had been included in the venture; they did not trust  their elders.\n\n\n As the years went by, Martin began to lose even his detached interest  in the land and its doings. Although the yacht frequently touched port  for fuel or supplies\u2014it was more economical to purchase them in that  era than to have them shipped from the future\u2014he seldom went ashore,  and then only at the urging of a newly assigned cousin anxious to see  the sights. Most of the time Martin spent in watching the sea\u2014and  sometimes he painted it. There seemed to be a depth to his seascapes  that his other work lacked.\n\n\n When he was pressed by the current cousin to make a land visit  somewhere, he decided to exhibit a few of his sea paintings. That way,  he could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to this  journey. He'd come to believe that perhaps what his life lacked was  purpose, and for a while he kept looking for meaning everywhere, to the  cousin's utter disgust.\n\n\n \"Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as you  do,\" the cousin\u2014who was rather woolly in history; the descendants were  scraping bottom now\u2014advised.\n\n\n Martin showed his work in Italy, so that the cousin could be  disillusioned by the current crop of Romans. He found that neither  purpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored.  However, a museum bought two of the paintings. Martin thought of Ives  and felt an uncomfortable pang of a sensation he could no longer  understand.\n\n\n \"Where do you suppose Conrad has been all this time?\" Martin idly asked  the current cousin\u2014who was passing as his nephew by now.\n\n\n The young man jumped, then glanced around him uncomfortably. \"Conrad's  a very shrewd fellow,\" he whispered. \"He's biding his time\u2014waiting  until we're off guard. And then\u2014pow!\u2014he'll attack!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I see,\" Martin said.\n\n\n He had often fancied that Conrad would prove to be the most stimulating  member of the whole generation. But it seemed unlikely that he would  ever have a chance for a conversation with the young man. More than one  conversation, anyhow.\n\n\n \"When he does show up, I'll protect you,\" the cousin vowed, touching  his ray gun. \"You haven't a thing to worry about.\"\n\n\n Martin smiled with all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire. \"I  have every confidence in you,\" he told his descendant. He himself had  given up carrying a gun long ago.\n\n\n There was a war in the Northern Hemisphere and so The Interregnum voyaged to southern waters. There was a war in the south and they hid  out in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power\u2014fuel  and man and will\u2014to fight, so there was a sterile peace for a long  time. The Interregnum roamed the seas restlessly, with her load of  passengers from the future, plus one bored and aging contemporary. She  bore big guns now, because of the ever-present danger of pirates.

SMITH\n\n\n Illustrated by DILLON\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction August 1957.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] No one, least of all Martin, could dispute   that a man's life should be guarded by his   kin\u2014but by those who hadn't been born yet? Nobody in the neighborhood was surprised when Martin's mother  disappeared and Ninian came to take care of him. Mothers had a way  of disappearing around those parts and the kids were often better  off without them. Martin was no exception. He'd never had it this  good while he was living with his old lady. As for his father, Martin  had never had one. He'd been a war baby, born of one of the tides of  soldiers\u2014enemies and allies, both\u2014that had engulfed the country in  successive waves and bought or taken the women. So there was no trouble  that way.\n\n\n Sometimes he wondered who Ninian really was. Obviously that story  about her coming from the future was just a gag. Besides, if she really  was his great-great-grand-daughter, as she said, why would she tell  him to call her \" Aunt Ninian \"? Maybe he was only eleven, but he'd  been around and he knew just what the score was. At first he'd thought  maybe she was some new kind of social worker, but she acted a little  too crazy for that.\n\n\n He loved to bait her, as he had loved to bait his mother. It was safer  with Ninian, though, because when he pushed her too far, she would cry  instead of mopping up the floor with him.\n\n\n \"But I can't understand,\" he would say, keeping his face straight. \"Why  do you have to come from the future to protect me against your cousin  Conrad?\"\n\n\n \"Because he's coming to kill you.\"\n\n\n \"Why should he kill me? I ain't done him nothing.\"\n\n\n Ninian sighed. \"He's dissatisfied with the current social order and  killing you is part of an elaborate plan he's formulated to change it.  You wouldn't understand.\"\n\n\n \"You're damn right. I don't understand. What's it all about in  straight gas?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, just don't ask any questions,\" Ninian said petulantly. \"When you  get older, someone will explain the whole thing to you.\" So Martin held his peace, because, on the whole, he liked things the  way they were. Ninian really was the limit, though. All the people he  knew lived in scabrous tenement apartments like his, but she seemed to  think it was disgusting.\n\n\n \"So if you don't like it, clean it up,\" he suggested.\n\n\n She looked at him as if he were out of his mind.\n\n\n \"Hire a maid, then!\" he jeered.\n\n\n And darned if that dope didn't go out and get a woman to come clean up  the place! He was so embarrassed, he didn't even dare show his face in  the streets\u2014especially with the women buttonholing him and demanding  to know what gave. They tried talking to Ninian, but she certainly knew  how to give them the cold shoulder.\n\n\n One day the truant officer came to ask why Martin hadn't been coming  to school. Very few of the neighborhood kids attended classes very  regularly, so this was just routine. But Ninian didn't know that and  she went into a real tizzy, babbling that Martin had been sick and  would make up the work. Martin nearly did get sick from laughing so  hard inside.\n\n\n But he laughed out of the other side of his mouth when she went out and  hired a private tutor for him. A tutor\u2014in that neighborhood! Martin  had to beat up every kid on the block before he could walk a step  without hearing \"Fancy Pants!\" yelled after him.\n\n\n Ninian worried all the time. It wasn't that she cared what these people  thought of her, for she made no secret of regarding them as little  better than animals, but she was shy of attracting attention. There  were an awful lot of people in that neighborhood who felt exactly the  same way, only she didn't know that, either. She was really pretty  dumb, Martin thought, for all her fancy lingo.\n\n\n \"It's so hard to think these things out without any prior practical  application to go by,\" she told him.\n\n\n He nodded, knowing what she meant was that everything was coming out  wrong. But he didn't try to help her; he just watched to see what  she'd do next. Already he had begun to assume the detached role of a  spectator.\n\n\n When it became clear that his mother was never going to show up again,  Ninian bought one of those smallish, almost identical houses that  mushroom on the fringes of a city after every war, particularly where  intensive bombing has created a number of desirable building sites.\n\n\n \"This is a much better neighborhood for a boy to grow up in,\" she  declared. \"Besides, it's easier to keep an eye on you here.\"\n\n\n And keep an eye on him she did\u2014she or a rather foppish young man who  came to stay with them occasionally. Martin was told to call him Uncle  Raymond.\n\n\n From time to time, there were other visitors\u2014Uncles Ives and  Bartholomew and Olaf, Aunts Ottillie and Grania and Lalage, and many  more\u2014all cousins to one another, he was told, all descendants of his. Martin was never left alone for a minute. He wasn't allowed to play  with the other kids in the new neighborhood. Not that their parents  would have let them, anyway. The adults obviously figured that if  a one-car family hired private tutors for their kid, there must be  something pretty wrong with him. So Martin and Ninian were just as  conspicuous as before. But he didn't tip her off. She was grown up; she  was supposed to know better than he did.\n\n\n He lived well. He had food to eat that he'd never dreamed of before,  warm clothes that no one had ever worn before him. He was surrounded by  more luxury than he knew what to do with.\n\n\n The furniture was the latest New Grand Rapids African modern. There  were tidy, colorful Picasso and Braque prints on the walls. And every  inch of the floor was modestly covered by carpeting, though the walls  were mostly unabashed glass. There were hot water and heat all the time  and a freezer well stocked with food\u2014somewhat erratically chosen, for  Ninian didn't know much about meals.\n\n\n The non-glass part of the house was of neat, natural-toned wood, with a  neat green lawn in front and a neat parti-colored garden in back.\n\n\n Martin missed the old neighborhood, though. He missed having other  kids to play with. He even missed his mother. Sure, she hadn't given  him enough to eat and she'd beaten him up so hard sometimes that she'd  nearly killed him\u2014but then there had also been times when she'd hugged  and kissed him and soaked his collar with her tears. She'd done all  she could for him, supporting him in the only way she knew how\u2014and if  respectable society didn't like it, the hell with respectable society.\n\n\n From Ninian and her cousins, there was only an impersonal kindness.  They made no bones about the fact that they were there only to carry  out a rather unpleasant duty. Though they were in the house with him,  in their minds and in their talk they were living in another world\u2014a  world of warmth and peace and plenty where nobody worked, except in the  government service or the essential professions. And they seemed to  think even that kind of job was pretty low-class, though better than  actually doing anything with the hands.\n\n\n In their world, Martin came to understand, nobody worked with hands;  everything was done by machinery. All the people ever did was wear  pretty clothes and have good times and eat all they wanted. There was  no devastation, no war, no unhappiness, none of the concomitants of  normal living.\n\n\n It was then that Martin began to realize that either the whole lot of  them were insane, or what Ninian had told him at first was the truth.  They came from the future. When Martin was sixteen, Raymond took him aside for the talk Ninian had  promised five years before.\n\n\n \"The whole thing's all my brother Conrad's fault. You see, he's an  idealist,\" Raymond explained, pronouncing the last word with distaste.\n\n\n Martin nodded gravely. He was a quiet boy now, his brief past a dim and  rather ridiculous memory. Who could ever imagine him robbing a grocery  store or wielding a broken bottle now? He still was rather undersized  and he'd read so much that he'd weakened his eyes and had to wear  glasses. His face was pallid, because he spent little time in the sun,  and his speech rather overbred, his mentors from the future having  carefully eradicated all current vulgarities.\n\n\n \"And Conrad really got upset over the way Earth has been exploiting  the not so intelligent life-forms on the other planets,\" Raymond  continued. \"Which is distressing\u2014though, of course, it's not as  if they were people. Besides, the government has been talking about  passing laws to do away with the\u2014well, abuses and things like that,  and I'm sure someday everything will come out all right. However,  Conrad is so impatient.\"\n\n\n \"I thought, in your world, machines did all the work,\" Martin suggested.\n\n\n \"I've told you\u2014our world is precisely the same as this one!\" Raymond  snapped. \"We just come a couple of centuries or so later, that's all.  But remember, our interests are identical. We're virtually the same  people ... although it is amazing what a difference two hundred odd  years of progress and polish can make in a species, isn't it?\"\n\n\n He continued more mildly: \"However, even you ought to be able to  understand that we can't make machinery without metal. We need food.  All that sort of thing comes from the out-system planets. And, on those  worlds, it's far cheaper to use native labor than to ship out all that  expensive machinery. After all, if we didn't give the natives jobs, how  would they manage to live?\"\n\n\n \"How did they live before? Come to think of it, if you don't work, how  do you live now?... I don't mean in the now for me, but the now for  you,\" Martin explained laboriously. It was so difficult to live in the  past and think in the future.\n\n\n \"I'm trying to talk to you as if you were an adult,\" Raymond said, \"but  if you will persist in these childish interruptions\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry,\" Martin said.\n\n\n But he wasn't, for by now he had little respect left for any of  his descendants. They were all exceedingly handsome and cultivated  young people, with superior educations, smooth ways of speaking and  considerable self-confidence, but they just weren't very bright. And  he had discovered that Raymond was perhaps the most intelligent of the  lot. Somewhere in that relatively short span of time, his line or\u2014more  frightening\u2014his race had lost something vital.\n\n\n Unaware of the near-contempt in which his young ancestor held him,  Raymond went on blandly: \"Anyhow, Conrad took it upon himself to  feel particularly guilty, because, he decided, if it hadn't been for  the fact that our great-grandfather discovered the super-drive, we  might never have reached the stars. Which is ridiculous\u2014his feeling  guilty, I mean. Perhaps a great-grandfather is responsible for his  great-grandchildren, but a great-grandchild can hardly be held  accountable for his great-grandfather.\"\n\n\n \"How about a great-great-grandchild?\" Martin couldn't help asking. Raymond flushed a delicate pink. \"Do you want to hear the rest of this  or don't you?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I do!\" Martin said. He had pieced the whole thing together for  himself long since, but he wanted to hear how Raymond would put it.\n\n\n \"Unfortunately, Professor Farkas has just perfected the time  transmitter. Those government scientists are so infernally  officious\u2014always inventing such senseless things. It's supposed to  be hush-hush, but you know how news will leak out when one is always  desperate for a fresh topic of conversation.\"\n\n\n Anyhow, Raymond went on to explain, Conrad had bribed one of Farkas'  assistants for a set of the plans. Conrad's idea had been to go back  in time and \"eliminate!\" their common great-grandfather. In that way,  there would be no space-drive, and, hence, the Terrestrials would never  get to the other planets and oppress the local aborigines.\n\n\n \"Sounds like a good way of dealing with the problem,\" Martin observed.\n\n\n Raymond looked annoyed. \"It's the adolescent way,\" he said, \"to do  away with it, rather than find a solution. Would you destroy a whole  society in order to root out a single injustice?\"\n\n\n \"Not if it were a good one otherwise.\"\n\n\n \"Well, there's your answer. Conrad got the apparatus built, or perhaps  he built it himself. One doesn't inquire too closely into such  matters. But when it came to the point, Conrad couldn't bear the idea  of eliminating our great-grandfather\u2014because our great-grandfather  was such a good man, you know.\" Raymond's expressive upper lip  curled. \"So Conrad decided to go further back still and get rid of  his great-grandfather's father\u2014who'd been, by all accounts, a pretty  worthless character.\"\n\n\n \"That would be me, I suppose,\" Martin said quietly.\n\n\n Raymond turned a deep rose. \"Well, doesn't that just go to prove you  mustn't believe everything you hear?\" The next sentence tumbled out in  a rush. \"I wormed the whole thing out of him and all of us\u2014the other  cousins and me\u2014held a council of war, as it were, and we decided it  was our moral duty to go back in time ourselves and protect you.\" He  beamed at Martin.\n\n\n The boy smiled slowly. \"Of course. You had to. If Conrad succeeded in eliminating me, then none of you would exist, would you?\"\n\n\n Raymond frowned. Then he shrugged cheerfully. \"Well, you didn't really  suppose we were going to all this trouble and expense out of sheer  altruism, did you?\" he asked, turning on the charm which all the  cousins possessed to a consternating degree. Martin had, of course, no illusions on that score; he had learned long  ago that nobody did anything for nothing. But saying so was unwise.\n\n\n \"We bribed another set of plans out of another of the professor's  assistants,\" Raymond continued, as if Martin had answered,  \"and\u2014ah\u2014induced a handicraft enthusiast to build the gadget for us.\" Induced , Martin knew, could have meant anything from blackmail to the  use of the iron maiden.\n\n\n \"Then we were all ready to forestall Conrad. If one of us guarded you  night and day, he would never be able to carry out his plot. So we made  our counter-plan, set the machine as far back as it would go\u2014and here  we are!\"\n\n\n \"I see,\" Martin said.\n\n\n Raymond didn't seem to think he really did. \"After all,\" he pointed  out defensively, \"whatever our motives, it has turned into a good  thing for you. Nice home, cultured companions, all the contemporary  conveniences, plus some handy anachronisms\u2014I don't see what more you  could ask for. You're getting the best of all possible worlds. Of  course Ninian was a ninny to locate in a mercantile suburb where any  little thing out of the way will cause talk. How thankful I am that our  era has completely disposed of the mercantiles\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What did you do with them?\" Martin asked.\n\n\n But Raymond rushed on: \"Soon as Ninian goes and I'm in full charge,  we'll get a more isolated place and run it on a far grander scale.  Ostentation\u2014that's the way to live here and now; the richer you are,  the more eccentricity you can get away with. And,\" he added, \"I might  as well be as comfortable as possible while I suffer through this  wretched historical stint.\"\n\n\n \"So Ninian's going,\" said Martin, wondering why the news made him feel  curiously desolate. Because, although he supposed he liked her in a  remote kind of way, he had no fondness for her\u2014or she, he knew, for  him.\n\n\n \"Well, five years is rather a long stretch for any girl to spend in  exile,\" Raymond explained, \"even though our life spans are a bit longer  than yours. Besides, you're getting too old now to be under petticoat  government.\" He looked inquisitively at Martin. \"You're not going to  go all weepy and make a scene when she leaves, are you?\"\n\n\n \"No....\" Martin said hesitantly. \"Oh, I suppose I will miss her. But we  aren't very close, so it won't make a real difference.\" That was the  sad part: he already knew it wouldn't make a difference.\n\n\n Raymond clapped him on the shoulder. \"I knew you weren't a sloppy  sentimentalist like Conrad. Though you do have rather a look of him,  you know.\"\n\n\n Suddenly that seemed to make Conrad real. Martin felt a vague stirring  of alarm. He kept his voice composed, however. \"How do you plan to  protect me when he comes?\"\n\n\n \"Well, each one of us is armed to the teeth, of course,\" Raymond said  with modest pride, displaying something that looked like a child's  combination spaceman's gun and death ray, but which, Martin had no  doubt, was a perfectly genuine\u2014and lethal\u2014weapon. \"And we've got a  rather elaborate burglar alarm system.\"\n\n\n Martin inspected the system and made one or two changes in the wiring  which, he felt, would increase its efficiency. But still he was  dubious. \"Maybe it'll work on someone coming from outside this house ,  but do you think it will work on someone coming from outside this time ?\"\n\n\n \"Never fear\u2014it has a temporal radius,\" Raymond replied. \"Factory  guarantee and all that.\"\n\n\n \"Just to be on the safe side,\" Martin said, \"I think I'd better have  one of those guns, too.\"\n\n\n \"A splendid idea!\" enthused Raymond. \"I was just about to think of that  myself!\" When it came time for the parting, it was Ninian who cried\u2014tears at  her own inadequacy, Martin knew, not of sorrow. He was getting skillful  at understanding his descendants, far better than they at understanding  him. But then they never really tried. Ninian kissed him wetly on the  cheek and said she was sure everything would work out all right and  that she'd come see him again. She never did, though, except at the  very last.\n\n\n Raymond and Martin moved into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. The  site proved a well-chosen one; when the Second Atomic War came, half a  dozen years later, they weren't touched. Martin was never sure whether  this had been sheer luck or expert planning. Probably luck, because his  descendants were exceedingly inept planners.\n\n\n Few people in the world then could afford to live as stylishly as  Martin and his guardian. The place not only contained every possible  convenience and gadget but was crammed with bibelots and antiques,  carefully chosen by Raymond and disputed by Martin, for, to the man  from the future, all available artifacts were antiques. Otherwise,  Martin accepted his new surroundings. His sense of wonder had become  dulled by now and the pink pseudo-Spanish castle\u2014\"architecturally  dreadful, of course,\" Raymond had said, \"but so hilariously  typical\"\u2014impressed him far less than had the suburban split-level  aquarium.\n\n\n \"How about a moat?\" Martin suggested when they first came. \"It seems to  go with a castle.\" \"Do you think a moat could stop Conrad?\" Raymond asked, amused.\n\n\n \"No,\" Martin smiled, feeling rather silly, \"but it would make the place  seem safer somehow.\"\n\n\n The threat of Conrad was beginning to make him grow more and more  nervous. He got Raymond's permission to take two suits of armor that  stood in the front hall and present them to a local museum, because  several times he fancied he saw them move. He also became an adept with  the ray gun and changed the surrounding landscape quite a bit with it,  until Raymond warned that this might lead Conrad to them.\n\n\n During those early years, Martin's tutors were exchanged for the  higher-degreed ones that were now needful. The question inevitably  arose of what the youth's vocation in that life was going to be. At  least twenty of the cousins came back through time to hold one of  their vigorous family councils. Martin was still young enough to enjoy  such occasions, finding them vastly superior to all other forms of  entertainment. \"This sort of problem wouldn't arise in our day, Martin,\" Raymond  commented as he took his place at the head of the table, \"because,  unless one specifically feels a call to some profession or other, one  just\u2014well, drifts along happily.\"\n\n\n \"Ours is a wonderful world,\" Grania sighed at Martin. \"I only wish we  could take you there. I'm sure you would like it.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Grania!\" Raymond snapped. \"Well, Martin, have you  made up your mind what you want to be?\"\n\n\n Martin affected to think. \"A physicist,\" he said, not without malice.  \"Or perhaps an engineer.\"\n\n\n There was a loud, excited chorus of dissent. He chuckled inwardly.\n\n\n \"Can't do that,\" Ives said. \"Might pick up some concepts from us. Don't  know how; none of us knows a thing about science. But it could happen.  Subconscious osmosis, if there is such a thing. That way, you might  invent something ahead of time. And the fellow we got the plans from  particularly cautioned us against that. Changing history. Dangerous.\"\n\n\n \"Might mess up our time frightfully,\" Bartholomew contributed, \"though,  to be perfectly frank, I can't quite understand how.\"\n\n\n \"I am not going to sit down and explain the whole thing to you all over  again, Bart!\" Raymond said impatiently. \"Well, Martin?\"\n\n\n \"What would you suggest?\" Martin asked.\n\n\n \"How about becoming a painter? Art is eternal. And quite gentlemanly.  Besides, artists are always expected to be either behind or ahead of  their times.\"\n\n\n \"Furthermore,\" Ottillie added, \"one more artist couldn't make much  difference in history. There were so many of them all through the ages.\"\n\n\n Martin couldn't hold back his question. \"What was I, actually, in that  other time?\"\n\n\n There was a chilly silence.\n\n\n \"Let's not talk about it, dear,\" Lalage finally said. \"Let's just be  thankful we've saved you from that !\"\n\n\n So drawing teachers were engaged and Martin became a very competent  second-rate artist. He knew he would never be able to achieve first  rank because, even though he was still so young, his work was almost  purely intellectual. The only emotion he seemed able to feel was  fear\u2014the ever-present fear that someday he would turn a corridor and  walk into a man who looked like him\u2014a man who wanted to kill him for  the sake of an ideal.\n\n\n But the fear did not show in Martin's pictures. They were pretty  pictures. Cousin Ives\u2014now that Martin was older, he was told to call the  descendants cousin \u2014next assumed guardianship. Ives took his  responsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arranged  to have Martin's work shown at an art gallery. The paintings received  critical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm. The modest  sale they enjoyed was mostly to interior decorators. Museums were not  interested.\n\n\n \"Takes time,\" Ives tried to reassure him. \"One day they'll be buying  your pictures, Martin. Wait and see.\"\n\n\n Ives was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martin  as an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other young  man failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was a  change of air and scenery.\n\n\n \"'Course you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't invented  space travel yet. But we can go see this world. What's left of it.  Tourists always like ruins best, anyway.\"\n\n\n So he drew on the family's vast future resources and bought a yacht,  which Martin christened The Interregnum . They traveled about from sea  to ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and making  trips inland. Martin saw the civilized world\u2014mostly in fragments; the  nearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much the  same as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormous  museum; he couldn't seem to identify with his own time any more.\n\n\n The other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters,  largely because they could spend so much time far away from the  contemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. So  they never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on The Interregnum . He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, although  there was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler through  time.\n\n\n More cousins were in residence at once than ever before, because  they came for the ocean voyage. They spent most of their time aboard  ship, giving each other parties and playing an avant-garde form of  shuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usually  ended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another of  having got advance information about the results.\n\n\n Martin didn't care much for their company and associated with them only  when not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, though  they were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn't court  his society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable. He rather liked Ives, though. Sometimes the two of them would be alone  together; then Ives would tell Martin of the future world he had come  from. The picture drawn by Raymond and Ninian had not been entirely  accurate, Ives admitted. True, there was no war or poverty on Earth  proper, but that was because there were only a couple of million people  left on the planet. It was an enclave for the highly privileged, highly  interbred aristocracy, to which Martin's descendants belonged by virtue  of their distinguished ancestry.\n\n\n \"Rather feudal, isn't it?\" Martin asked.\n\n\n Ives agreed, adding that the system had, however, been deliberately  planned, rather than the result of haphazard natural development.  Everything potentially unpleasant, like the mercantiles, had been  deported.\n\n\n \"Not only natives livin' on the other worlds,\" Ives said as the two  of them stood at the ship's rail, surrounded by the limitless expanse  of some ocean or other. \"People, too. Mostly lower classes, except  for officials and things. With wars and want and suffering,\" he added  regretfully, \"same as in your day.... Like now, I mean,\" he corrected  himself. \"Maybe it is worse, the way Conrad thinks. More planets  for us to make trouble on. Three that were habitable aren't any more.  Bombed. Very thorough job.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" Martin murmured, trying to sound shocked, horrified\u2014interested,  even.\n\n\n \"Sometimes I'm not altogether sure Conrad was wrong,\" Ives said, after  a pause. \"Tried to keep us from getting to the stars, hurting the  people\u2014I expect you could call them people\u2014there. Still\u2014\" he smiled  shamefacedly\u2014\"couldn't stand by and see my own way of life destroyed,  could I?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose not,\" Martin said.\n\n\n \"Would take moral courage. I don't have it. None of us does, except  Conrad, and even he\u2014\" Ives looked out over the sea. \"Must be a better  way out than Conrad's,\" he said without conviction. \"And everything  will work out all right in the end. Bound to. No sense to\u2014to anything,  if it doesn't.\" He glanced wistfully at Martin.\n\n\n \"I hope so,\" said Martin. But he couldn't hope; he couldn't feel; he  couldn't even seem to care.\n\n\n During all this time, Conrad still did not put in an appearance. Martin  had gotten to be such a crack shot with the ray pistol that he almost  wished his descendant would show up, so there would be some excitement.  But he didn't come. And Martin got to thinking....\n\n\n He always felt that if any of the cousins could have come to realize  the basic flaw in the elaborate plan they had concocted, it would have  been Ives. However, when the yacht touched at Tierra del Fuego one  bitter winter, Ives took a severe chill. They sent for a doctor from  the future\u2014one of the descendants who had been eccentric enough to  take a medical degree\u2014but he wasn't able to save Ives. The body was  buried in the frozen ground at Ushuaia, on the southern tip of the  continent, a hundred years or more before the date of his birth.\n\n\n A great many of the cousins turned up at the simple ceremony. All were  dressed in overwhelming black and showed a great deal of grief. Raymond  read the burial service, because they didn't dare summon a clerical  cousin from the future; they were afraid he might prove rather stuffy  about the entire undertaking.\n\n\n \"He died for all of us,\" Raymond concluded his funeral eulogy over  Ives, \"so his death was not in vain.\"\n\n\n But Martin disagreed. The ceaseless voyaging began again. The Interregnum voyaged to every  ocean and every sea. Some were blue and some green and some dun. After  a while, Martin couldn't tell one from another. Cousin after cousin  came to watch over him and eventually they were as hard for him to tell  apart as the different oceans. All the cousins were young, for, though they came at different times in  his life, they had all started out from the same time in theirs. Only  the young ones had been included in the venture; they did not trust  their elders.\n\n\n As the years went by, Martin began to lose even his detached interest  in the land and its doings. Although the yacht frequently touched port  for fuel or supplies\u2014it was more economical to purchase them in that  era than to have them shipped from the future\u2014he seldom went ashore,  and then only at the urging of a newly assigned cousin anxious to see  the sights. Most of the time Martin spent in watching the sea\u2014and  sometimes he painted it. There seemed to be a depth to his seascapes  that his other work lacked.\n\n\n When he was pressed by the current cousin to make a land visit  somewhere, he decided to exhibit a few of his sea paintings. That way,  he could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to this  journey. He'd come to believe that perhaps what his life lacked was  purpose, and for a while he kept looking for meaning everywhere, to the  cousin's utter disgust.\n\n\n \"Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as you  do,\" the cousin\u2014who was rather woolly in history; the descendants were  scraping bottom now\u2014advised.\n\n\n Martin showed his work in Italy, so that the cousin could be  disillusioned by the current crop of Romans. He found that neither  purpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored.  However, a museum bought two of the paintings. Martin thought of Ives  and felt an uncomfortable pang of a sensation he could no longer  understand.\n\n\n \"Where do you suppose Conrad has been all this time?\" Martin idly asked  the current cousin\u2014who was passing as his nephew by now.\n\n\n The young man jumped, then glanced around him uncomfortably. \"Conrad's  a very shrewd fellow,\" he whispered. \"He's biding his time\u2014waiting  until we're off guard. And then\u2014pow!\u2014he'll attack!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I see,\" Martin said.\n\n\n He had often fancied that Conrad would prove to be the most stimulating  member of the whole generation. But it seemed unlikely that he would  ever have a chance for a conversation with the young man. More than one  conversation, anyhow.\n\n\n \"When he does show up, I'll protect you,\" the cousin vowed, touching  his ray gun. \"You haven't a thing to worry about.\"\n\n\n Martin smiled with all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire. \"I  have every confidence in you,\" he told his descendant. He himself had  given up carrying a gun long ago.\n\n\n There was a war in the Northern Hemisphere and so The Interregnum voyaged to southern waters. There was a war in the south and they hid  out in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power\u2014fuel  and man and will\u2014to fight, so there was a sterile peace for a long  time. The Interregnum roamed the seas restlessly, with her load of  passengers from the future, plus one bored and aging contemporary. She  bore big guns now, because of the ever-present danger of pirates. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy doesn't Martin explain the flaw in the plan to the cousins?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Martin does not want the future generations to turn out like his descendants.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Martin finds the cousins very irritating.

SMITH\n\n\n Illustrated by DILLON\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction August 1957.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] No one, least of all Martin, could dispute   that a man's life should be guarded by his   kin\u2014but by those who hadn't been born yet? Nobody in the neighborhood was surprised when Martin's mother  disappeared and Ninian came to take care of him. Mothers had a way  of disappearing around those parts and the kids were often better  off without them. Martin was no exception. He'd never had it this  good while he was living with his old lady. As for his father, Martin  had never had one. He'd been a war baby, born of one of the tides of  soldiers\u2014enemies and allies, both\u2014that had engulfed the country in  successive waves and bought or taken the women. So there was no trouble  that way.\n\n\n Sometimes he wondered who Ninian really was. Obviously that story  about her coming from the future was just a gag. Besides, if she really  was his great-great-grand-daughter, as she said, why would she tell  him to call her \" Aunt Ninian \"? Maybe he was only eleven, but he'd  been around and he knew just what the score was. At first he'd thought  maybe she was some new kind of social worker, but she acted a little  too crazy for that.\n\n\n He loved to bait her, as he had loved to bait his mother. It was safer  with Ninian, though, because when he pushed her too far, she would cry  instead of mopping up the floor with him.\n\n\n \"But I can't understand,\" he would say, keeping his face straight. \"Why  do you have to come from the future to protect me against your cousin  Conrad?\"\n\n\n \"Because he's coming to kill you.\"\n\n\n \"Why should he kill me? I ain't done him nothing.\"\n\n\n Ninian sighed. \"He's dissatisfied with the current social order and  killing you is part of an elaborate plan he's formulated to change it.  You wouldn't understand.\"\n\n\n \"You're damn right. I don't understand. What's it all about in  straight gas?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, just don't ask any questions,\" Ninian said petulantly. \"When you  get older, someone will explain the whole thing to you.\" So Martin held his peace, because, on the whole, he liked things the  way they were. Ninian really was the limit, though. All the people he  knew lived in scabrous tenement apartments like his, but she seemed to  think it was disgusting.\n\n\n \"So if you don't like it, clean it up,\" he suggested.\n\n\n She looked at him as if he were out of his mind.\n\n\n \"Hire a maid, then!\" he jeered.\n\n\n And darned if that dope didn't go out and get a woman to come clean up  the place! He was so embarrassed, he didn't even dare show his face in  the streets\u2014especially with the women buttonholing him and demanding  to know what gave. They tried talking to Ninian, but she certainly knew  how to give them the cold shoulder.\n\n\n One day the truant officer came to ask why Martin hadn't been coming  to school. Very few of the neighborhood kids attended classes very  regularly, so this was just routine. But Ninian didn't know that and  she went into a real tizzy, babbling that Martin had been sick and  would make up the work. Martin nearly did get sick from laughing so  hard inside.\n\n\n But he laughed out of the other side of his mouth when she went out and  hired a private tutor for him. A tutor\u2014in that neighborhood! Martin  had to beat up every kid on the block before he could walk a step  without hearing \"Fancy Pants!\" yelled after him.\n\n\n Ninian worried all the time. It wasn't that she cared what these people  thought of her, for she made no secret of regarding them as little  better than animals, but she was shy of attracting attention. There  were an awful lot of people in that neighborhood who felt exactly the  same way, only she didn't know that, either. She was really pretty  dumb, Martin thought, for all her fancy lingo.\n\n\n \"It's so hard to think these things out without any prior practical  application to go by,\" she told him.\n\n\n He nodded, knowing what she meant was that everything was coming out  wrong. But he didn't try to help her; he just watched to see what  she'd do next. Already he had begun to assume the detached role of a  spectator.\n\n\n When it became clear that his mother was never going to show up again,  Ninian bought one of those smallish, almost identical houses that  mushroom on the fringes of a city after every war, particularly where  intensive bombing has created a number of desirable building sites.\n\n\n \"This is a much better neighborhood for a boy to grow up in,\" she  declared. \"Besides, it's easier to keep an eye on you here.\"\n\n\n And keep an eye on him she did\u2014she or a rather foppish young man who  came to stay with them occasionally. Martin was told to call him Uncle  Raymond.\n\n\n From time to time, there were other visitors\u2014Uncles Ives and  Bartholomew and Olaf, Aunts Ottillie and Grania and Lalage, and many  more\u2014all cousins to one another, he was told, all descendants of his. Martin was never left alone for a minute. He wasn't allowed to play  with the other kids in the new neighborhood. Not that their parents  would have let them, anyway. The adults obviously figured that if  a one-car family hired private tutors for their kid, there must be  something pretty wrong with him. So Martin and Ninian were just as  conspicuous as before. But he didn't tip her off. She was grown up; she  was supposed to know better than he did.\n\n\n He lived well. He had food to eat that he'd never dreamed of before,  warm clothes that no one had ever worn before him. He was surrounded by  more luxury than he knew what to do with.\n\n\n The furniture was the latest New Grand Rapids African modern. There  were tidy, colorful Picasso and Braque prints on the walls. And every  inch of the floor was modestly covered by carpeting, though the walls  were mostly unabashed glass. There were hot water and heat all the time  and a freezer well stocked with food\u2014somewhat erratically chosen, for  Ninian didn't know much about meals.\n\n\n The non-glass part of the house was of neat, natural-toned wood, with a  neat green lawn in front and a neat parti-colored garden in back.\n\n\n Martin missed the old neighborhood, though. He missed having other  kids to play with. He even missed his mother. Sure, she hadn't given  him enough to eat and she'd beaten him up so hard sometimes that she'd  nearly killed him\u2014but then there had also been times when she'd hugged  and kissed him and soaked his collar with her tears. She'd done all  she could for him, supporting him in the only way she knew how\u2014and if  respectable society didn't like it, the hell with respectable society.\n\n\n From Ninian and her cousins, there was only an impersonal kindness.  They made no bones about the fact that they were there only to carry  out a rather unpleasant duty. Though they were in the house with him,  in their minds and in their talk they were living in another world\u2014a  world of warmth and peace and plenty where nobody worked, except in the  government service or the essential professions. And they seemed to  think even that kind of job was pretty low-class, though better than  actually doing anything with the hands.\n\n\n In their world, Martin came to understand, nobody worked with hands;  everything was done by machinery. All the people ever did was wear  pretty clothes and have good times and eat all they wanted. There was  no devastation, no war, no unhappiness, none of the concomitants of  normal living.\n\n\n It was then that Martin began to realize that either the whole lot of  them were insane, or what Ninian had told him at first was the truth.  They came from the future. When Martin was sixteen, Raymond took him aside for the talk Ninian had  promised five years before.\n\n\n \"The whole thing's all my brother Conrad's fault. You see, he's an  idealist,\" Raymond explained, pronouncing the last word with distaste.\n\n\n Martin nodded gravely. He was a quiet boy now, his brief past a dim and  rather ridiculous memory. Who could ever imagine him robbing a grocery  store or wielding a broken bottle now? He still was rather undersized  and he'd read so much that he'd weakened his eyes and had to wear  glasses. His face was pallid, because he spent little time in the sun,  and his speech rather overbred, his mentors from the future having  carefully eradicated all current vulgarities.\n\n\n \"And Conrad really got upset over the way Earth has been exploiting  the not so intelligent life-forms on the other planets,\" Raymond  continued. \"Which is distressing\u2014though, of course, it's not as  if they were people. Besides, the government has been talking about  passing laws to do away with the\u2014well, abuses and things like that,  and I'm sure someday everything will come out all right. However,  Conrad is so impatient.\"\n\n\n \"I thought, in your world, machines did all the work,\" Martin suggested.\n\n\n \"I've told you\u2014our world is precisely the same as this one!\" Raymond  snapped. \"We just come a couple of centuries or so later, that's all.  But remember, our interests are identical. We're virtually the same  people ... although it is amazing what a difference two hundred odd  years of progress and polish can make in a species, isn't it?\"\n\n\n He continued more mildly: \"However, even you ought to be able to  understand that we can't make machinery without metal. We need food.  All that sort of thing comes from the out-system planets. And, on those  worlds, it's far cheaper to use native labor than to ship out all that  expensive machinery. After all, if we didn't give the natives jobs, how  would they manage to live?\"\n\n\n \"How did they live before? Come to think of it, if you don't work, how  do you live now?... I don't mean in the now for me, but the now for  you,\" Martin explained laboriously. It was so difficult to live in the  past and think in the future.\n\n\n \"I'm trying to talk to you as if you were an adult,\" Raymond said, \"but  if you will persist in these childish interruptions\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry,\" Martin said.\n\n\n But he wasn't, for by now he had little respect left for any of  his descendants. They were all exceedingly handsome and cultivated  young people, with superior educations, smooth ways of speaking and  considerable self-confidence, but they just weren't very bright. And  he had discovered that Raymond was perhaps the most intelligent of the  lot. Somewhere in that relatively short span of time, his line or\u2014more  frightening\u2014his race had lost something vital.\n\n\n Unaware of the near-contempt in which his young ancestor held him,  Raymond went on blandly: \"Anyhow, Conrad took it upon himself to  feel particularly guilty, because, he decided, if it hadn't been for  the fact that our great-grandfather discovered the super-drive, we  might never have reached the stars. Which is ridiculous\u2014his feeling  guilty, I mean. Perhaps a great-grandfather is responsible for his  great-grandchildren, but a great-grandchild can hardly be held  accountable for his great-grandfather.\"\n\n\n \"How about a great-great-grandchild?\" Martin couldn't help asking. Raymond flushed a delicate pink. \"Do you want to hear the rest of this  or don't you?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I do!\" Martin said. He had pieced the whole thing together for  himself long since, but he wanted to hear how Raymond would put it.\n\n\n \"Unfortunately, Professor Farkas has just perfected the time  transmitter. Those government scientists are so infernally  officious\u2014always inventing such senseless things. It's supposed to  be hush-hush, but you know how news will leak out when one is always  desperate for a fresh topic of conversation.\"\n\n\n Anyhow, Raymond went on to explain, Conrad had bribed one of Farkas'  assistants for a set of the plans. Conrad's idea had been to go back  in time and \"eliminate!\" their common great-grandfather. In that way,  there would be no space-drive, and, hence, the Terrestrials would never  get to the other planets and oppress the local aborigines.\n\n\n \"Sounds like a good way of dealing with the problem,\" Martin observed.\n\n\n Raymond looked annoyed. \"It's the adolescent way,\" he said, \"to do  away with it, rather than find a solution. Would you destroy a whole  society in order to root out a single injustice?\"\n\n\n \"Not if it were a good one otherwise.\"\n\n\n \"Well, there's your answer. Conrad got the apparatus built, or perhaps  he built it himself. One doesn't inquire too closely into such  matters. But when it came to the point, Conrad couldn't bear the idea  of eliminating our great-grandfather\u2014because our great-grandfather  was such a good man, you know.\" Raymond's expressive upper lip  curled. \"So Conrad decided to go further back still and get rid of  his great-grandfather's father\u2014who'd been, by all accounts, a pretty  worthless character.\"\n\n\n \"That would be me, I suppose,\" Martin said quietly.\n\n\n Raymond turned a deep rose. \"Well, doesn't that just go to prove you  mustn't believe everything you hear?\" The next sentence tumbled out in  a rush. \"I wormed the whole thing out of him and all of us\u2014the other  cousins and me\u2014held a council of war, as it were, and we decided it  was our moral duty to go back in time ourselves and protect you.\" He  beamed at Martin.\n\n\n The boy smiled slowly. \"Of course. You had to. If Conrad succeeded in eliminating me, then none of you would exist, would you?\"\n\n\n Raymond frowned. Then he shrugged cheerfully. \"Well, you didn't really  suppose we were going to all this trouble and expense out of sheer  altruism, did you?\" he asked, turning on the charm which all the  cousins possessed to a consternating degree. Martin had, of course, no illusions on that score; he had learned long  ago that nobody did anything for nothing. But saying so was unwise.\n\n\n \"We bribed another set of plans out of another of the professor's  assistants,\" Raymond continued, as if Martin had answered,  \"and\u2014ah\u2014induced a handicraft enthusiast to build the gadget for us.\" Induced , Martin knew, could have meant anything from blackmail to the  use of the iron maiden.\n\n\n \"Then we were all ready to forestall Conrad. If one of us guarded you  night and day, he would never be able to carry out his plot. So we made  our counter-plan, set the machine as far back as it would go\u2014and here  we are!\"\n\n\n \"I see,\" Martin said.\n\n\n Raymond didn't seem to think he really did. \"After all,\" he pointed  out defensively, \"whatever our motives, it has turned into a good  thing for you. Nice home, cultured companions, all the contemporary  conveniences, plus some handy anachronisms\u2014I don't see what more you  could ask for. You're getting the best of all possible worlds. Of  course Ninian was a ninny to locate in a mercantile suburb where any  little thing out of the way will cause talk. How thankful I am that our  era has completely disposed of the mercantiles\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What did you do with them?\" Martin asked.\n\n\n But Raymond rushed on: \"Soon as Ninian goes and I'm in full charge,  we'll get a more isolated place and run it on a far grander scale.  Ostentation\u2014that's the way to live here and now; the richer you are,  the more eccentricity you can get away with. And,\" he added, \"I might  as well be as comfortable as possible while I suffer through this  wretched historical stint.\"\n\n\n \"So Ninian's going,\" said Martin, wondering why the news made him feel  curiously desolate. Because, although he supposed he liked her in a  remote kind of way, he had no fondness for her\u2014or she, he knew, for  him.\n\n\n \"Well, five years is rather a long stretch for any girl to spend in  exile,\" Raymond explained, \"even though our life spans are a bit longer  than yours. Besides, you're getting too old now to be under petticoat  government.\" He looked inquisitively at Martin. \"You're not going to  go all weepy and make a scene when she leaves, are you?\"\n\n\n \"No....\" Martin said hesitantly. \"Oh, I suppose I will miss her. But we  aren't very close, so it won't make a real difference.\" That was the  sad part: he already knew it wouldn't make a difference.\n\n\n Raymond clapped him on the shoulder. \"I knew you weren't a sloppy  sentimentalist like Conrad. Though you do have rather a look of him,  you know.\"\n\n\n Suddenly that seemed to make Conrad real. Martin felt a vague stirring  of alarm. He kept his voice composed, however. \"How do you plan to  protect me when he comes?\"\n\n\n \"Well, each one of us is armed to the teeth, of course,\" Raymond said  with modest pride, displaying something that looked like a child's  combination spaceman's gun and death ray, but which, Martin had no  doubt, was a perfectly genuine\u2014and lethal\u2014weapon. \"And we've got a  rather elaborate burglar alarm system.\"\n\n\n Martin inspected the system and made one or two changes in the wiring  which, he felt, would increase its efficiency. But still he was  dubious. \"Maybe it'll work on someone coming from outside this house ,  but do you think it will work on someone coming from outside this time ?\"\n\n\n \"Never fear\u2014it has a temporal radius,\" Raymond replied. \"Factory  guarantee and all that.\"\n\n\n \"Just to be on the safe side,\" Martin said, \"I think I'd better have  one of those guns, too.\"\n\n\n \"A splendid idea!\" enthused Raymond. \"I was just about to think of that  myself!\" When it came time for the parting, it was Ninian who cried\u2014tears at  her own inadequacy, Martin knew, not of sorrow. He was getting skillful  at understanding his descendants, far better than they at understanding  him. But then they never really tried. Ninian kissed him wetly on the  cheek and said she was sure everything would work out all right and  that she'd come see him again. She never did, though, except at the  very last.\n\n\n Raymond and Martin moved into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. The  site proved a well-chosen one; when the Second Atomic War came, half a  dozen years later, they weren't touched. Martin was never sure whether  this had been sheer luck or expert planning. Probably luck, because his  descendants were exceedingly inept planners.\n\n\n Few people in the world then could afford to live as stylishly as  Martin and his guardian. The place not only contained every possible  convenience and gadget but was crammed with bibelots and antiques,  carefully chosen by Raymond and disputed by Martin, for, to the man  from the future, all available artifacts were antiques. Otherwise,  Martin accepted his new surroundings. His sense of wonder had become  dulled by now and the pink pseudo-Spanish castle\u2014\"architecturally  dreadful, of course,\" Raymond had said, \"but so hilariously  typical\"\u2014impressed him far less than had the suburban split-level  aquarium.\n\n\n \"How about a moat?\" Martin suggested when they first came. \"It seems to  go with a castle.\" \"Do you think a moat could stop Conrad?\" Raymond asked, amused.\n\n\n \"No,\" Martin smiled, feeling rather silly, \"but it would make the place  seem safer somehow.\"\n\n\n The threat of Conrad was beginning to make him grow more and more  nervous. He got Raymond's permission to take two suits of armor that  stood in the front hall and present them to a local museum, because  several times he fancied he saw them move. He also became an adept with  the ray gun and changed the surrounding landscape quite a bit with it,  until Raymond warned that this might lead Conrad to them.\n\n\n During those early years, Martin's tutors were exchanged for the  higher-degreed ones that were now needful. The question inevitably  arose of what the youth's vocation in that life was going to be. At  least twenty of the cousins came back through time to hold one of  their vigorous family councils. Martin was still young enough to enjoy  such occasions, finding them vastly superior to all other forms of  entertainment. \"This sort of problem wouldn't arise in our day, Martin,\" Raymond  commented as he took his place at the head of the table, \"because,  unless one specifically feels a call to some profession or other, one  just\u2014well, drifts along happily.\"\n\n\n \"Ours is a wonderful world,\" Grania sighed at Martin. \"I only wish we  could take you there. I'm sure you would like it.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Grania!\" Raymond snapped. \"Well, Martin, have you  made up your mind what you want to be?\"\n\n\n Martin affected to think. \"A physicist,\" he said, not without malice.  \"Or perhaps an engineer.\"\n\n\n There was a loud, excited chorus of dissent. He chuckled inwardly.\n\n\n \"Can't do that,\" Ives said. \"Might pick up some concepts from us. Don't  know how; none of us knows a thing about science. But it could happen.  Subconscious osmosis, if there is such a thing. That way, you might  invent something ahead of time. And the fellow we got the plans from  particularly cautioned us against that. Changing history. Dangerous.\"\n\n\n \"Might mess up our time frightfully,\" Bartholomew contributed, \"though,  to be perfectly frank, I can't quite understand how.\"\n\n\n \"I am not going to sit down and explain the whole thing to you all over  again, Bart!\" Raymond said impatiently. \"Well, Martin?\"\n\n\n \"What would you suggest?\" Martin asked.\n\n\n \"How about becoming a painter? Art is eternal. And quite gentlemanly.  Besides, artists are always expected to be either behind or ahead of  their times.\"\n\n\n \"Furthermore,\" Ottillie added, \"one more artist couldn't make much  difference in history. There were so many of them all through the ages.\"\n\n\n Martin couldn't hold back his question. \"What was I, actually, in that  other time?\"\n\n\n There was a chilly silence.\n\n\n \"Let's not talk about it, dear,\" Lalage finally said. \"Let's just be  thankful we've saved you from that !\"\n\n\n So drawing teachers were engaged and Martin became a very competent  second-rate artist. He knew he would never be able to achieve first  rank because, even though he was still so young, his work was almost  purely intellectual. The only emotion he seemed able to feel was  fear\u2014the ever-present fear that someday he would turn a corridor and  walk into a man who looked like him\u2014a man who wanted to kill him for  the sake of an ideal.\n\n\n But the fear did not show in Martin's pictures. They were pretty  pictures. Cousin Ives\u2014now that Martin was older, he was told to call the  descendants cousin \u2014next assumed guardianship. Ives took his  responsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arranged  to have Martin's work shown at an art gallery. The paintings received  critical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm. The modest  sale they enjoyed was mostly to interior decorators. Museums were not  interested.\n\n\n \"Takes time,\" Ives tried to reassure him. \"One day they'll be buying  your pictures, Martin. Wait and see.\"\n\n\n Ives was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martin  as an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other young  man failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was a  change of air and scenery.\n\n\n \"'Course you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't invented  space travel yet. But we can go see this world. What's left of it.  Tourists always like ruins best, anyway.\"\n\n\n So he drew on the family's vast future resources and bought a yacht,  which Martin christened The Interregnum . They traveled about from sea  to ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and making  trips inland. Martin saw the civilized world\u2014mostly in fragments; the  nearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much the  same as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormous  museum; he couldn't seem to identify with his own time any more.\n\n\n The other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters,  largely because they could spend so much time far away from the  contemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. So  they never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on The Interregnum . He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, although  there was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler through  time.\n\n\n More cousins were in residence at once than ever before, because  they came for the ocean voyage. They spent most of their time aboard  ship, giving each other parties and playing an avant-garde form of  shuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usually  ended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another of  having got advance information about the results.\n\n\n Martin didn't care much for their company and associated with them only  when not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, though  they were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn't court  his society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable. He rather liked Ives, though. Sometimes the two of them would be alone  together; then Ives would tell Martin of the future world he had come  from. The picture drawn by Raymond and Ninian had not been entirely  accurate, Ives admitted. True, there was no war or poverty on Earth  proper, but that was because there were only a couple of million people  left on the planet. It was an enclave for the highly privileged, highly  interbred aristocracy, to which Martin's descendants belonged by virtue  of their distinguished ancestry.\n\n\n \"Rather feudal, isn't it?\" Martin asked.\n\n\n Ives agreed, adding that the system had, however, been deliberately  planned, rather than the result of haphazard natural development.  Everything potentially unpleasant, like the mercantiles, had been  deported.\n\n\n \"Not only natives livin' on the other worlds,\" Ives said as the two  of them stood at the ship's rail, surrounded by the limitless expanse  of some ocean or other. \"People, too. Mostly lower classes, except  for officials and things. With wars and want and suffering,\" he added  regretfully, \"same as in your day.... Like now, I mean,\" he corrected  himself. \"Maybe it is worse, the way Conrad thinks. More planets  for us to make trouble on. Three that were habitable aren't any more.  Bombed. Very thorough job.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" Martin murmured, trying to sound shocked, horrified\u2014interested,  even.\n\n\n \"Sometimes I'm not altogether sure Conrad was wrong,\" Ives said, after  a pause. \"Tried to keep us from getting to the stars, hurting the  people\u2014I expect you could call them people\u2014there. Still\u2014\" he smiled  shamefacedly\u2014\"couldn't stand by and see my own way of life destroyed,  could I?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose not,\" Martin said.\n\n\n \"Would take moral courage. I don't have it. None of us does, except  Conrad, and even he\u2014\" Ives looked out over the sea. \"Must be a better  way out than Conrad's,\" he said without conviction. \"And everything  will work out all right in the end. Bound to. No sense to\u2014to anything,  if it doesn't.\" He glanced wistfully at Martin.\n\n\n \"I hope so,\" said Martin. But he couldn't hope; he couldn't feel; he  couldn't even seem to care.\n\n\n During all this time, Conrad still did not put in an appearance. Martin  had gotten to be such a crack shot with the ray pistol that he almost  wished his descendant would show up, so there would be some excitement.  But he didn't come. And Martin got to thinking....\n\n\n He always felt that if any of the cousins could have come to realize  the basic flaw in the elaborate plan they had concocted, it would have  been Ives. However, when the yacht touched at Tierra del Fuego one  bitter winter, Ives took a severe chill. They sent for a doctor from  the future\u2014one of the descendants who had been eccentric enough to  take a medical degree\u2014but he wasn't able to save Ives. The body was  buried in the frozen ground at Ushuaia, on the southern tip of the  continent, a hundred years or more before the date of his birth.\n\n\n A great many of the cousins turned up at the simple ceremony. All were  dressed in overwhelming black and showed a great deal of grief. Raymond  read the burial service, because they didn't dare summon a clerical  cousin from the future; they were afraid he might prove rather stuffy  about the entire undertaking.\n\n\n \"He died for all of us,\" Raymond concluded his funeral eulogy over  Ives, \"so his death was not in vain.\"\n\n\n But Martin disagreed. The ceaseless voyaging began again. The Interregnum voyaged to every  ocean and every sea. Some were blue and some green and some dun. After  a while, Martin couldn't tell one from another. Cousin after cousin  came to watch over him and eventually they were as hard for him to tell  apart as the different oceans. All the cousins were young, for, though they came at different times in  his life, they had all started out from the same time in theirs. Only  the young ones had been included in the venture; they did not trust  their elders.\n\n\n As the years went by, Martin began to lose even his detached interest  in the land and its doings. Although the yacht frequently touched port  for fuel or supplies\u2014it was more economical to purchase them in that  era than to have them shipped from the future\u2014he seldom went ashore,  and then only at the urging of a newly assigned cousin anxious to see  the sights. Most of the time Martin spent in watching the sea\u2014and  sometimes he painted it. There seemed to be a depth to his seascapes  that his other work lacked.\n\n\n When he was pressed by the current cousin to make a land visit  somewhere, he decided to exhibit a few of his sea paintings. That way,  he could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to this  journey. He'd come to believe that perhaps what his life lacked was  purpose, and for a while he kept looking for meaning everywhere, to the  cousin's utter disgust.\n\n\n \"Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as you  do,\" the cousin\u2014who was rather woolly in history; the descendants were  scraping bottom now\u2014advised.\n\n\n Martin showed his work in Italy, so that the cousin could be  disillusioned by the current crop of Romans. He found that neither  purpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored.  However, a museum bought two of the paintings. Martin thought of Ives  and felt an uncomfortable pang of a sensation he could no longer  understand.\n\n\n \"Where do you suppose Conrad has been all this time?\" Martin idly asked  the current cousin\u2014who was passing as his nephew by now.\n\n\n The young man jumped, then glanced around him uncomfortably. \"Conrad's  a very shrewd fellow,\" he whispered. \"He's biding his time\u2014waiting  until we're off guard. And then\u2014pow!\u2014he'll attack!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I see,\" Martin said.\n\n\n He had often fancied that Conrad would prove to be the most stimulating  member of the whole generation. But it seemed unlikely that he would  ever have a chance for a conversation with the young man. More than one  conversation, anyhow.\n\n\n \"When he does show up, I'll protect you,\" the cousin vowed, touching  his ray gun. \"You haven't a thing to worry about.\"\n\n\n Martin smiled with all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire. \"I  have every confidence in you,\" he told his descendant. He himself had  given up carrying a gun long ago.\n\n\n There was a war in the Northern Hemisphere and so The Interregnum voyaged to southern waters. There was a war in the south and they hid  out in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power\u2014fuel  and man and will\u2014to fight, so there was a sterile peace for a long  time. The Interregnum roamed the seas restlessly, with her load of  passengers from the future, plus one bored and aging contemporary. She  bore big guns now, because of the ever-present danger of pirates. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy doesn't Martin explain the flaw in the plan to the cousins?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Martin does not want the future generations to turn out like his descendants.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Martin finds the cousins very irritating.
