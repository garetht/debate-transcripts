      "background_text": "The Dwindling Years He didn\u2019t expect to be last\u2014but  neither did he anticipate  the horror of being the first! By LESTER DEL REY Illustrated by JOHNS NEARLY TWO hundred  years of habit carried the  chairman of Exodus Corporation  through the morning ritual  of crossing the executive  floor. Giles made the expected  comments, smiled the proper  smiles and greeted his staff by  the right names, but it was purely  automatic. Somehow, thinking  had grown difficult in the mornings  recently. Inside his private office, he  dropped all pretense and slumped  into the padding of his chair, gasping  for breath and feeling his  heart hammering in his chest.  He\u2019d been a fool to come to work,  he realized. But with the Procyon  shuttle arriving yesterday, there  was no telling what might turn  up. Besides, that fool of a medicist  had sworn the shot would  cure any allergy or asthma. Giles heard his secretary come  in, but it wasn\u2019t until the smell  of the coffee reached his nose  that he looked up. She handed  him a filled cup and set the carafe  down on the age-polished surface  of the big desk. She watched  solicitously as he drank. \u201cThat bad, Arthur?\u201d she asked. \u201cJust a little tired,\u201d he told  her, refilling the cup. She\u2019d made  the coffee stronger than usual  and it seemed to cut through  some of the thickness in his head.  \u201cI guess I\u2019m getting old, Amanda.\u201d She smiled dutifully at the  time-worn joke, but he knew she  wasn\u2019t fooled. She\u2019d cycled to  middle age four times in her  job and she probably knew him  better than he knew himself\u2014which  wouldn\u2019t be hard, he  thought. He\u2019d hardly recognized  the stranger in the mirror as he  tried to shave. His normal thinness  had looked almost gaunt  and there were hollows in his  face and circles under his eyes.  Even his hair had seemed thinner,  though that, of course, was  impossible. \u201cAnything urgent on the Procyon  shuttle?\u201d he asked as she  continue staring at him with worried  eyes. SHE JERKED her gaze away  guiltily and turned to the incoming  basket. \u201cMostly drugs for  experimenting. A personal letter  for you, relayed from some place  I never heard of. And one of the  super-light missiles! They found  it drifting half a light-year out  and captured it. Jordan\u2019s got a  report on it and he\u2019s going crazy.  But if you don\u2019t feel well\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m all right!\u201d he told her  sharply. Then he steadied himself  and managed to smile. \u201cThanks  for the coffee, Amanda.\u201d She accepted dismissal reluctantly.  When she was gone, he  sat gazing at the report from Jordan  at Research. For eighty years now, they\u2019d  been sending out the little ships  that vanished at greater than the  speed of light, equipped with  every conceivable device to make  them return automatically after  taking pictures of wherever they  arrived. So far, none had ever returned  or been located. This was  the first hope they\u2019d found that  the century-long trips between  stars in the ponderous shuttles  might be ended and he should  have been filled with excitement  at Jordan\u2019s hasty preliminary report. He leafed through it. The little  ship apparently had been picked  up by accident when it almost  collided with a Sirius-local ship.  Scientists there had puzzled over  it, reset it and sent it back. The  two white rats on it had still been  alive. Giles dropped the report wearily  and picked up the personal  message that had come on the  shuttle. He fingered the microstrip  inside while he drank another  coffee, and finally pulled  out the microviewer. There were  three frames to the message, he  saw with some surprise. He didn\u2019t need to see the signature  on the first projection.  Only his youngest son would have  sent an elaborate tercentenary  greeting verse\u2014one that would  arrive ninety years too late! Harry  had been born just before Earth  passed the drastic birth limitation  act and his mother had  spoiled him. He\u2019d even tried to  avoid the compulsory emigration  draft and stay on with his mother.  It had been the bitter quarrels  over that which had finally  broken Giles\u2019 fifth marriage. Oddly enough, the message in  the next frame showed none of  that. Harry had nothing but  praise for the solar system where  he\u2019d been sent. He barely mentioned  being married on the way  or his dozen children, but filled  most of the frame with glowing  description and a plea for his  father to join him there! GILES SNORTED and turned  to the third frame, which  showed a group picture of the  family in some sort of vehicle,  against the background of an alien  but attractive world. He had no desire to spend  ninety years cooped up with a  bunch of callow young emigrants,  even in one of the improved Exodus  shuttles. And even if Exodus  ever got the super-light  drive working, there was no reason  he should give up his work.  The discovery that men could  live practically forever had put  an end to most family ties; sentiment  wore thin in half a century\u2014which  wasn\u2019t much time  now, though it had once seemed  long enough. Strange how the years seemed  to get shorter as their number increased.  There\u2019d been a song  once\u2014something about the years  dwindling down. He groped for  the lines and couldn\u2019t remember.  Drat it! Now he\u2019d probably lie  awake most of the night again,  trying to recall them. The outside line buzzed musically,  flashing Research\u2019s number.  Giles grunted in irritation. He  wasn\u2019t ready to face Jordan yet.  But he shrugged and pressed the  button. The intense face that looked  from the screen was frowning as  Jordan\u2019s eyes seemed to sweep  around the room. He was still  young\u2014one of the few under  a hundred who\u2019d escaped deportation  because of special ability\u2014and  patience was still foreign to  him. Then the frown vanished as  an expression of shock replaced  it, and Giles felt a sinking sensation.  If he looked that bad\u2014 But Jordan wasn\u2019t looking at  him; the man\u2019s interest lay in the  projected picture from Harry, across  the desk from the communicator. \u201cAntigravity!\u201d His voice was  unbelieving as he turned his head  to face the older man. \u201cWhat  world is that?\u201d Giles forced his attention on  the picture again and this time  he noticed the vehicle shown. It  was enough like an old model  Earth conveyance to pass casual  inspection, but it floated wheellessly  above the ground. Faint  blur lines indicated it had been  moving when the picture was  taken. \u201cOne of my sons\u2014\u201d Giles  started to answer. \u201cI could find  the star\u2019s designation....\u201d Jordan cursed harshly. \u201cSo we  can send a message on the shuttle,  begging for their secret in a  couple of hundred years! While  a hundred other worlds make a  thousand major discoveries they  don\u2019t bother reporting! Can\u2019t the  Council see anything ?\u201d Giles had heard it all before.  Earth was becoming a backwater  world; no real progress had been  made in two centuries; the young  men were sent out as soon as  their first fifty years of education  were finished, and the older men  were too conservative for really  new thinking. There was a measure  of truth in it, unfortunately. \u201cThey\u2019ll slow up when their  populations fill,\u201d Giles repeated  his old answers. \u201cWe\u2019re still ahead  in medicine and we\u2019ll get the  other discoveries eventually, without  interrupting the work of making  the Earth fit for our longevity.  We can wait. We\u2019ll have to.\u201d THE YOUNGER man stared  at him with the strange puzzled  look Giles had seen too often  lately. \u201cDamn it, haven\u2019t you read  my report? We know the super-light  drive works! That missile  reached Sirius in less than ten  days. We can have the secret of  this antigravity in less than a  year! We\u2014\u201d \u201cWait a minute.\u201d Giles felt the  thickness pushing back at his  mind and tried to fight it off. He\u2019d  only skimmed the report, but this  made no sense. \u201cYou mean you  can calibrate your guiding devices  accurately enough to get a  missile where you want it and  back?\u201d \u201c What? \u201d Jordan\u2019s voice rattled  the speaker. \u201cOf course not! It  took two accidents to get the  thing back to us\u2014and with a  half-light-year miss that delayed  it about twenty years before the  Procyon shuttle heard its signal.  Pre-setting a course may take  centuries, if we can ever master  it. Even with Sirius expecting the  missiles and ready to cooperate.  I mean the big ship. We\u2019ve had it  drafted for building long enough;  now we can finish it in three  months. We know the drive works.  We know it\u2019s fast enough to reach  Procyon in two weeks. We even  know life can stand the trip. The  rats were unharmed.\u201d Giles shook his head at what  the other was proposing, only  partly believing it. \u201cRats don\u2019t  have minds that could show any  real damage such as the loss of  power to rejuvenate. We can\u2019t put  human pilots into a ship with our  drive until we\u2019ve tested it more  thoroughly, Bill, even if they  could correct for errors on arrival.  Maybe if we put in stronger signaling  transmitters....\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe in two centuries  we\u2019d have a through route charted  to Sirius. And we still wouldn\u2019t  have proved it safe for human  pilots. Mr. Giles, we\u2019ve got to  have the big ship. All we need is one volunteer!\u201d It occurred to Giles then that  the man had been too fired with  the idea to think. He leaned back,  shaking his head again wearily.  \u201cAll right, Bill. Find me one volunteer.  Or how about you? Do  you really want to risk losing the  rest of your life rather than waiting  a couple more centuries until  we know it\u2019s safe? If you do, I\u2019ll  order the big ship.\u201d Jordan opened his mouth and  for a second Giles\u2019 heart caught  in a flux of emotions as the  man\u2019s offer hovered on his lips.  Then the engineer shut his mouth  slowly. The belligerence ran out  of him. He looked sick, for he had no  answer. NO SANE man would risk a  chance for near eternity  against such a relatively short  wait. Heroism had belonged to  those who knew their days were  numbered, anyhow. \u201cForget it, Bill,\u201d Giles advised.  \u201cIt may take longer, but eventually  we\u2019ll find a way. With time  enough, we\u2019re bound to. And  when we do, the ship will be  ready.\u201d The engineer nodded miserably  and clicked off. Giles turned  from the blank screen to stare  out of the windows, while his  hand came up to twist at the lock  of hair over his forehead. Eternity!  They had to plan and build  for it. They couldn\u2019t risk that  plan for short-term benefits. Usually  it was too easy to realize that,  and the sight of the solid, time-enduring  buildings outside should  have given him a sense of security. Today, though, nothing seemed  to help. He felt choked, imprisoned,  somehow lost; the city beyond  the window blurred as he  studied it, and he swung the chair  back so violently that his hand  jerked painfully on the forelock  he\u2019d been twisting. Then he was staring unbelievingly  at the single white hair that  was twisted with the dark ones  between his fingers. Like an automaton, he bent  forward, his other hand groping  for the mirror that should be in  one of the drawers. The dull pain  in his chest sharpened and his  breath was hoarse in his throat,  but he hardly noticed as he found  the mirror and brought it up. His  eyes focused reluctantly. There  were other white strands in his  dark hair. The mirror crashed to the floor  as he staggered out of the office. It was only two blocks to Giles\u2019  residence club, but he had to  stop twice to catch his breath  and fight against the pain that  clawed at his chest. When he  reached the wood-paneled lobby,  he was barely able to stand. Dubbins was at his side almost  at once, with a hand under  his arm to guide him toward his  suite. \u201cLet me help you, sir,\u201d Dubbins  suggested, in the tones  Giles hadn\u2019t heard since the man  had been his valet, back when  it was still possible to find personal  servants. Now he managed  the club on a level of quasi-equality  with the members. For the  moment, though, he\u2019d slipped  back into the old ways. GILES FOUND himself lying  on his couch, partially undressed,  with the pillows just right  and a long drink in his hand. The  alcohol combined with the reaction  from his panic to leave him  almost himself again. After all,  there was nothing to worry about;  Earth\u2019s doctors could cure anything. \u201cI guess you\u2019d better call Dr.  Vincenti,\u201d he decided. Vincenti  was a member and would probably  be the quickest to get. Dubbins shook his head. \u201cDr.  Vincenti isn\u2019t with us, sir. He  left a year ago to visit a son in  the Centauri system. There\u2019s a  Dr. Cobb whose reputation is  very good, sir.\u201d Giles puzzled over it doubtfully.  Vincenti had been an oddly  morose man the last few times  he\u2019d seen him, but that could  hardly explain his taking a twenty-year  shuttle trip for such a  slim reason. It was no concern of  his, though. \u201cDr. Cobb, then,\u201d he  said. Giles heard the other man\u2019s  voice on the study phone, too low  for the words to be distinguishable.  He finished the drink, feeling  still better, and was sitting  up when Dubbins came back. \u201cDr. Cobb wants you to come  to his office at once, sir,\u201d he said,  dropping to his knee to help  Giles with his shoes. \u201cI\u2019d be  pleased to drive you there.\u201d Giles frowned. He\u2019d expected  Cobb to come to him. Then he  grimaced at his own thoughts.  Dubbins\u2019 manners must have carried  him back into the past; doctors  didn\u2019t go in for home visits  now\u2014they preferred to see their  patients in the laboratories that  housed their offices. If this kept  on, he\u2019d be missing the old days  when he\u2019d had a mansion and  counted his wealth in possessions,  instead of the treasures he could  build inside himself for the future  ahead. He was getting positively  childish! Yet he relished the feeling of  having Dubbins drive his car.  More than anything else, he\u2019d  loved being driven. Even after  chauffeurs were a thing of the  past, Harry had driven him  around. Now he\u2019d taken to walking,  as so many others had, for  even with modern safety measures  so strict, there was always  a small chance of some accident  and nobody had any desire to  spend the long future as a cripple. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you, sir,\u201d Dubbins  offered as they stopped beside  the low, massive medical building. It was almost too much consideration.  Giles nodded, got out  and headed down the hall uncertainly.  Just how bad did he  look? Well, he\u2019d soon find out. He located the directory and  finally found the right office, its  reception room wall covered  with all the degrees Dr. Cobb had  picked up in some three hundred  years of practice. Giles felt  better, realizing it wouldn\u2019t be  one of the younger men. COBB APPEARED himself,  before the nurse could take  over, and led Giles into a room  with an old-fashioned desk and  chairs that almost concealed the  cabinets of equipment beyond. He listened as Giles stumbled  out his story. Halfway through,  the nurse took a blood sample  with one of the little mosquito  needles and the machinery behind  the doctor began working on  it. \u201cYour friend told me about the  gray hair, of course,\u201d Cobb said.  At Giles\u2019 look, he smiled faintly.  \u201cSurely you didn\u2019t think people  could miss that in this day and  age? Let\u2019s see it.\u201d He inspected it and began  making tests. Some were older  than Giles could remember\u2014knee  reflex, blood pressure, pulse  and fluoroscope. Others involved  complicated little gadgets that  ran over his body, while meters  bobbed and wiggled. The blood  check came through and Cobb  studied it, to go back and make  further inspections of his own. At last he nodded slowly.  \u201cHyper-catabolism, of course. I  thought it might be. How long  since you had your last rejuvenation?  And who gave it?\u201d \u201cAbout ten years ago,\u201d Giles  answered. He found his identity  card and passed it over, while  the doctor studied it. \u201cMy sixteenth.\u201d It wasn\u2019t going right. He could  feel it. Some of the panic symptoms  were returning; the pulse in  his neck was pounding and his  breath was growing difficult.  Sweat ran down his sides from  his armpit and he wiped his palms  against his coat. \u201cAny particular emotional  strain when you were treated\u2014some  major upset in your life?\u201d  Cobb asked. Giles thought as carefully as  he could, but he remembered  nothing like that. \u201cYou mean\u2014it  didn\u2019t take? But I never had  any trouble, Doctor. I was one of  the first million cases, when a  lot of people couldn\u2019t rejuvenate  at all, and I had no trouble even  then.\u201d Cobb considered it, hesitated as  if making up his mind to be frank  against his better judgment. \u201cI  can\u2019t see any other explanation.  You\u2019ve got a slight case of angina\u2014nothing  serious, but quite definite\u2014as  well as other signs  of aging. I\u2019m afraid the treatment  didn\u2019t take fully. It might have  been some unconscious block  on your part, some infection not  diagnosed at the time, or even a  fault in the treatment. That\u2019s  pretty rare, but we can\u2019t neglect  the possibility.\u201d HE STUDIED his charts again  and then smiled. \u201cSo we\u2019ll  give you another treatment. Any  reason you can\u2019t begin immediately?\u201d Giles remembered that Dubbins  was waiting for him, but this  was more important. It hadn\u2019t  been a joke about his growing old,  after all. But now, in a few days,  he\u2019d be his old\u2014no, of course  not\u2014his young self again! They went down the hall to  another office, where Giles waited  outside while Cobb conferred  with another doctor and technician,  with much waving of charts.  He resented every second of it.  It was as if the almost forgotten  specter of age stood beside him,  counting the seconds. But at last  they were through and he was led  into the quiet rejuvenation room,  where the clamps were adjusted  about his head and the earpieces  were fitted. The drugs were shot  painlessly into his arm and the  light-pulser was adjusted to his  brain-wave pattern. It had been nothing like this his  first time. Then it had required  months of mental training, followed  by crude mechanical and  drug hypnosis for other months.  Somewhere in every human brain  lay the memory of what his cells  had been like when he was young.  Or perhaps it lay in the cells  themselves, with the brain as only  a linkage to it. They\u2019d discovered  that, and the fact that the mind  could effect physical changes in  the body. Even such things as  cancer could be willed out of existence\u2014provided  the brain  could be reached far below the  conscious level and forced to  operate. There had been impossible  faith cures for millenia\u2014cataracts  removed from blinded eyes  within minutes, even\u2014but finding  the mechanism in the brain  that worked those miracles had  taken an incredible amount of  study and finding a means of  bringing it under control had  taken even longer. Now they did it with dozens of  mechanical aids in addition to  the hypnotic instructions\u2014and  did it usually in a single sitting,  with the full transformation of  the body taking less than a week  after the treatment! But with all the equipment, it  wasn\u2019t impossible for a mistake  to happen. It had been no fault of  his ... he was sure of that ... his  mind was easy to reach ... he  could relax so easily.... He came out of it without  even a headache, while they were  removing the probes, but the  fatigue on the operator\u2019s face told  him it had been a long and difficult  job. He stretched experimentally,  with the eternal unconscious  expectation that he would  find himself suddenly young  again. But that, of course, was ridiculous.  It took days for the mind  to work on all the cells and to  repair the damage of time. COBB LED him back to the  first office, where he was given  an injection of some kind and  another sample of his blood was  taken, while the earlier tests were  repeated. But finally the doctor  nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s all for now, Mr. Giles.  You might drop in tomorrow  morning, after I\u2019ve had a chance  to complete my study of all this.  We\u2019ll know by then whether you\u2019ll  need more treatment. Ten o\u2019clock  okay?\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ll be all right?\u201d Cobb smiled the automatic reassurance  of his profession. \u201cWe  haven\u2019t lost a patient in two hundred  years, to my knowledge.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d said Giles. \u201cTen  o\u2019clock is fine.\u201d Dubbins was still waiting, reading  a paper whose headlined feature  carried a glowing account of  the discovery of the super-light  missile and what it might mean.  He took a quick look at Giles and  pointed to it. \u201cGreat work, Mr.  Giles. Maybe we\u2019ll all get to see  some of those other worlds yet.\u201d  Then he studied Giles more carefully.  \u201cEverything\u2019s in good shape  now, sir?\u201d \u201cThe doctor says everything\u2019s  going to be fine,\u201d Giles answered. It was then he realized for the  first time that Cobb had said no  such thing. A statement that  lightning had never struck a  house was no guarantee that it  never would. It was an evasion  meant to give such an impression. The worry nagged at him all  the way back. Word had already  gone around the club that he\u2019d  had some kind of attack and  there were endless questions that  kept it on his mind. And even  when it had been covered and  recovered, he could still sense the  glances of the others, as if he  were Vincenti in one of the man\u2019s  more morose moods. He found a single table in the  dining room and picked his way  through the meal, listening to  the conversation about him only  when it was necessary because  someone called across to him.  Ordinarily, he was quick to support  the idea of clubs in place  of private families. A man here  could choose his group and grow  into them. Yet he wasn\u2019t swallowed  by them, as he might be by  a family. Giles had been living  here for nearly a century now and  he\u2019d never regretted it. But tonight  his own group irritated him. He puzzled over it, finding no  real reason. Certainly they weren\u2019t  forcing themselves on him. He  remembered once when he\u2019d had  a cold, before they finally licked  that; Harry had been a complete  nuisance, running around with  various nostrums, giving him no  peace. Constant questions about  how he felt, constant little looks  of worry\u2014until he\u2019d been ready  to yell at the boy. In fact, he  had. Funny, he couldn\u2019t picture really  losing his temper here. Families  did odd things to a man. HE LISTENED to a few of  the discussions after the dinner,  but he\u2019d heard them all before,  except for one about the  super-speed drive, and there he  had no wish to talk until he could  study the final report. He gave up  at last and went to his own suite.  What he needed was a good  night\u2019s sleep after a little relaxation. Even that failed him, though.  He\u2019d developed one of the finest  chess collections in the world, but  tonight it held no interest. And  when he drew out his tools and  tried working on the delicate,  lovely jade for the set he was  carving his hands seemed to be  all thumbs. None of the other interests  he\u2019d developed through  the years helped to add to the  richness of living now. He gave it up and went to bed\u2014to  have the fragment of that  song pop into his head. Now there  was no escaping it. Something  about the years\u2014or was it days\u2014dwindling  down to something  or other. Could they really dwindle  down? Suppose he couldn\u2019t rejuvenate  all the way? He knew  that there were some people who  didn\u2019t respond as well as others.  Sol Graves, for instance. He\u2019d  been fifty when he finally learned  how to work with the doctors and  they could only bring him back to  about thirty, instead of the normal  early twenties. Would that  reduce the slice of eternity that  rejuvenation meant? And what  had happened to Sol? Or suppose it wasn\u2019t rejuvenation,  after all; suppose something  had gone wrong with him  permanently? He fought that off, but he  couldn\u2019t escape the nagging  doubts at the doctor\u2019s words. He got up once to stare at himself  in the mirror. Ten hours had  gone by and there should have  been some signs of improvement.  He couldn\u2019t be sure, though,  whether there were or not. He looked no better the next  morning when he finally dragged  himself up from the little sleep  he\u2019d managed to get. The hollows  were still there and the circles  under his eyes. He searched for  the gray in his hair, but the traitorous  strands had been removed  at the doctor\u2019s office and he could  find no new ones. He looked into the dining room  and then went by hastily. He  wanted no solicitous glances this  morning. Drat it, maybe he  should move out. Maybe trying  family life again would give him  some new interests. Amanda probably  would be willing to marry  him; she\u2019d hinted at a date once. He stopped, shocked by the  awareness that he hadn\u2019t been out  with a woman for.... He couldn\u2019t remember how  long it had been. Nor why. \u201cIn the spring, a young man\u2019s  fancy,\u201d he quoted to himself, and  then shuddered. It hadn\u2019t been that kind of  spring for him\u2014not this rejuvenation  nor the last, nor the one  before that. GILES TRIED to stop scaring  himself and partially succeeded,  until he reached the doctor\u2019s  office. Then it was no longer necessary  to frighten himself. The  wrongness was too strong, no matter  how professional Cobb\u2019s smile! He didn\u2019t hear the preliminary  words. He watched the smile vanish  as the stack of reports came  out. There was no nurse here  now. The machines were quiet\u2014and  all the doors were shut. Giles shook his head, interrupting  the doctor\u2019s technical jargon.  Now that he knew there was reason  for his fear, it seemed to  vanish, leaving a coldness that  numbed him. \u201cI\u2019d rather know the whole  truth,\u201d he said. His voice sounded  dead in his ears. \u201cThe worst first.  The rejuvenation...?\u201d Cobb sighed and yet seemed relieved.  \u201cFailed.\u201d He stopped, and  his hands touched the reports on  his desk. \u201cCompletely,\u201d he added  in a low, defeated tone. \u201cBut I thought that was impossible!\u201d \u201cSo did I. I wouldn\u2019t believe  it even yet\u2014but now I find it  isn\u2019t the first case. I spent the  night at Medical Center going up  the ranks until I found men who  really know about it. And now I  wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d His voice ran  down and he gathered himself together  by an effort. \u201cIt\u2019s a shock  to me, too, Mr. Giles. But\u2014well,  to simplify it, no memory is perfect\u2014even  cellular memory. It  loses a little each time. And the  effect is cumulative. It\u2019s like an  asymptotic curve\u2014the further it  goes, the steeper the curve. And\u2014well,  you\u2019ve passed too far.\u201d He faced away from Giles,  dropping the reports into a  drawer and locking it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t  supposed to tell you, of course.  It\u2019s going to be tough enough  when they\u2019re ready to let people  know. But you aren\u2019t the first and  you won\u2019t be the last, if that\u2019s any  consolation. We\u2019ve got a longer  time scale than we used to have\u2014but  it\u2019s in centuries, not in  eons. For everybody, not just  you.\u201d It was no consolation. Giles  nodded mechanically. \u201cI won\u2019t  talk, of course. How\u2014how long?\u201d Cobb spread his hands unhappily.  \u201cThirty years, maybe. But  we can make them better. Geriatric  knowledge is still on record.  We can fix the heart and all the  rest. You\u2019ll be in good physical  condition, better than your grandfather\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd then....\u201d Giles couldn\u2019t  pronounce the words. He\u2019d grown  old and he\u2019d grow older. And  eventually he\u2019d die! An immortal man had suddenly  found death hovering on his  trail. The years had dwindled and  gone, and only a few were left. He stood up, holding out his  hand. \u201cThank you, Doctor,\u201d he  said, and was surprised to find  he meant it. The man had done  all he could and had at least  saved him the suspense of growing  doubt and horrible eventual  discovery. OUTSIDE ON the street, he  looked up at the Sun and  then at the buildings built to last  for thousands of years. Their  eternity was no longer a part of  him. Even his car would outlast him. He climbed into it, still partly  numbed, and began driving mechanically,  no longer wondering  about the dangers that might possibly  arise. Those wouldn\u2019t matter  much now. For a man who  had thought of living almost forever,  thirty years was too short  a time to count. He was passing near the club  and started to slow. Then he  went on without stopping. He  wanted no chance to have them  asking questions he couldn\u2019t answer.  It was none of their business.  Dubbins had been kind\u2014but  now Giles wanted no kindness. The street led to the office  and he drove on. What else was  there for him? There, at least, he  could still fill his time with work\u2014work  that might even be useful.  In the future, men would  need the super-light drive if they  were to span much more of the  Universe than now. And he could  speed up the work in some ways  still, even if he could never see  its finish. It would be cold comfort but it  was something. And he might  keep busy enough to forget sometimes  that the years were gone  for him. Automatic habit carried him  through the office again, to Amanda\u2019s  desk, where her worry was  still riding her. He managed a  grin and somehow the right words  came to his lips. \u201cI saw the doctor,  Amanda, so you can stop  figuring ways to get me there.\u201d She smiled back suddenly, without  feigning it. \u201cThen you\u2019re all  right?\u201d \u201cAs all right as I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d  he told her. \u201cThey tell me I\u2019m just  growing old.\u201d This time her laugh was heartier.  He caught himself before he  could echo her mirth in a different  voice and went inside where she  had the coffee waiting for him. Oddly, it still tasted good to  him. The projection was off, he saw,  wondering whether he\u2019d left it on  or not. He snapped the switch and  saw the screen light up, with the  people still in the odd, wheelless  vehicle on the alien planet. FOR A long moment, he stared  at the picture without thinking,  and then bent closer. Harry\u2019s  face hadn\u2019t changed much. Giles  had almost forgotten it, but there  was still the same grin there. And  his grandchildren had a touch  of it, too. And of their grandfather\u2019s  nose, he thought. Funny,  he\u2019d never seen even pictures of  his other grandchildren. Family  ties melted away too fast for interstellar  travel. Yet there seemed to be no  slackening of them in Harry\u2019s  case, and somehow it looked like  a family, rather than a mere  group. A very pleasant family in  a very pleasant world. He read Harry\u2019s note again,  with its praise for the planet and  its invitation. He wondered if  Dr. Vincenti had received an invitation  like that, before he left.  Or had he even been one of those  to whom the same report had  been delivered by some doctor?  It didn\u2019t matter, but it would explain  things, at least. Twenty years to Centaurus,  while the years dwindled down\u2014 Then abruptly the line finished  itself. \u201cThe years dwindle down  to a precious few....\u201d he remembered.  \u201cA precious few.\u201d Those dwindling years had  been precious once. He unexpectedly  recalled his own grandfather  holding him on an old  knee and slipping him candy  that was forbidden. The years  seemed precious to the old man  then. Amanda\u2019s voice came abruptly  over the intercom. \u201cJordan wants  to talk to you,\u201d she said, and the  irritation was sharp in her voice.  \u201cHe won\u2019t take no!\u201d Giles shrugged and reached for  the projector, to cut it off. Then,  on impulse, he set it back to the  picture, studying the group again  as he switched on Jordan\u2019s wire. But he didn\u2019t wait for the hot  words about whatever was the  trouble. \u201cBill,\u201d he said, \u201cstart getting  the big ship into production. I\u2019ve  found a volunteer.\u201d He\u2019d been driven to it, he knew,  as he watched the man\u2019s amazed  face snap from the screen. From  the first suspicion of his trouble,  something inside him had been  forcing him to make this decision.  And maybe it would do no good.  Maybe the ship would fail. But  thirty years was a number a man  could risk. If he made it, though.... Well, he\u2019d see those grandchildren  of his this year\u2014and  Harry. Maybe he\u2019d even tell  Harry the truth, once they got  done celebrating the reunion. And  there\u2019d be other grandchildren.  With the ship, he\u2019d have time  enough to look them up. Plenty  of time! Thirty years was a long time,  when he stopped to think of it. \u2014LESTER DEL REY ",

By LESTER DEL REY Illustrated by JOHNS NEARLY TWO hundred  years of habit carried the  chairman of Exodus Corporation  through the morning ritual  of crossing the executive  floor. Giles made the expected  comments, smiled the proper  smiles and greeted his staff by  the right names, but it was purely  automatic. Somehow, thinking  had grown difficult in the mornings  recently. Inside his private office, he  dropped all pretense and slumped  into the padding of his chair, gasping  for breath and feeling his  heart hammering in his chest.  He\u2019d been a fool to come to work,  he realized. But with the Procyon  shuttle arriving yesterday, there  was no telling what might turn  up. Besides, that fool of a medicist  had sworn the shot would  cure any allergy or asthma. Giles heard his secretary come  in, but it wasn\u2019t until the smell  of the coffee reached his nose  that he looked up. She handed  him a filled cup and set the carafe  down on the age-polished surface  of the big desk. She watched  solicitously as he drank. \u201cThat bad, Arthur?\u201d she asked. \u201cJust a little tired,\u201d he told  her, refilling the cup. She\u2019d made  the coffee stronger than usual  and it seemed to cut through  some of the thickness in his head.  \u201cI guess I\u2019m getting old, Amanda.\u201d She smiled dutifully at the  time-worn joke, but he knew she  wasn\u2019t fooled. She\u2019d cycled to  middle age four times in her  job and she probably knew him  better than he knew himself\u2014which  wouldn\u2019t be hard, he  thought. He\u2019d hardly recognized  the stranger in the mirror as he  tried to shave. His normal thinness  had looked almost gaunt  and there were hollows in his  face and circles under his eyes.  Even his hair had seemed thinner,  though that, of course, was  impossible. \u201cAnything urgent on the Procyon  shuttle?\u201d he asked as she  continue staring at him with worried  eyes. SHE JERKED her gaze away  guiltily and turned to the incoming  basket. \u201cMostly drugs for  experimenting. A personal letter  for you, relayed from some place  I never heard of. And one of the  super-light missiles! They found  it drifting half a light-year out  and captured it. Jordan\u2019s got a  report on it and he\u2019s going crazy.  But if you don\u2019t feel well\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m all right!\u201d he told her  sharply. Then he steadied himself  and managed to smile. \u201cThanks  for the coffee, Amanda.\u201d She accepted dismissal reluctantly.  When she was gone, he  sat gazing at the report from Jordan  at Research. For eighty years now, they\u2019d  been sending out the little ships  that vanished at greater than the  speed of light, equipped with  every conceivable device to make  them return automatically after  taking pictures of wherever they  arrived. So far, none had ever returned  or been located. This was  the first hope they\u2019d found that  the century-long trips between  stars in the ponderous shuttles  might be ended and he should  have been filled with excitement  at Jordan\u2019s hasty preliminary report. He leafed through it. The little  ship apparently had been picked  up by accident when it almost  collided with a Sirius-local ship.  Scientists there had puzzled over  it, reset it and sent it back. The  two white rats on it had still been  alive. Giles dropped the report wearily  and picked up the personal  message that had come on the  shuttle. He fingered the microstrip  inside while he drank another  coffee, and finally pulled  out the microviewer. There were  three frames to the message, he  saw with some surprise. He didn\u2019t need to see the signature  on the first projection.  Only his youngest son would have  sent an elaborate tercentenary  greeting verse\u2014one that would  arrive ninety years too late! Harry  had been born just before Earth  passed the drastic birth limitation  act and his mother had  spoiled him. He\u2019d even tried to  avoid the compulsory emigration  draft and stay on with his mother.  It had been the bitter quarrels  over that which had finally  broken Giles\u2019 fifth marriage. Oddly enough, the message in  the next frame showed none of  that. Harry had nothing but  praise for the solar system where  he\u2019d been sent. He barely mentioned  being married on the way  or his dozen children, but filled  most of the frame with glowing  description and a plea for his  father to join him there! GILES SNORTED and turned  to the third frame, which  showed a group picture of the  family in some sort of vehicle,  against the background of an alien  but attractive world. He had no desire to spend  ninety years cooped up with a  bunch of callow young emigrants,  even in one of the improved Exodus  shuttles. And even if Exodus  ever got the super-light  drive working, there was no reason  he should give up his work.  The discovery that men could  live practically forever had put  an end to most family ties; sentiment  wore thin in half a century\u2014which  wasn\u2019t much time  now, though it had once seemed  long enough. Strange how the years seemed  to get shorter as their number increased.  There\u2019d been a song  once\u2014something about the years  dwindling down. He groped for  the lines and couldn\u2019t remember.  Drat it! Now he\u2019d probably lie  awake most of the night again,  trying to recall them. The outside line buzzed musically,  flashing Research\u2019s number.  Giles grunted in irritation. He  wasn\u2019t ready to face Jordan yet.  But he shrugged and pressed the  button. The intense face that looked  from the screen was frowning as  Jordan\u2019s eyes seemed to sweep  around the room. He was still  young\u2014one of the few under  a hundred who\u2019d escaped deportation  because of special ability\u2014and  patience was still foreign to  him. Then the frown vanished as  an expression of shock replaced  it, and Giles felt a sinking sensation.  If he looked that bad\u2014 But Jordan wasn\u2019t looking at  him; the man\u2019s interest lay in the  projected picture from Harry, across  the desk from the communicator. \u201cAntigravity!\u201d His voice was  unbelieving as he turned his head  to face the older man. \u201cWhat  world is that?\u201d Giles forced his attention on  the picture again and this time  he noticed the vehicle shown. It  was enough like an old model  Earth conveyance to pass casual  inspection, but it floated wheellessly  above the ground. Faint  blur lines indicated it had been  moving when the picture was  taken. \u201cOne of my sons\u2014\u201d Giles  started to answer. \u201cI could find  the star\u2019s designation....\u201d Jordan cursed harshly. \u201cSo we  can send a message on the shuttle,  begging for their secret in a  couple of hundred years! While  a hundred other worlds make a  thousand major discoveries they  don\u2019t bother reporting! Can\u2019t the  Council see anything ?\u201d Giles had heard it all before.  Earth was becoming a backwater  world; no real progress had been  made in two centuries; the young  men were sent out as soon as  their first fifty years of education  were finished, and the older men  were too conservative for really  new thinking. There was a measure  of truth in it, unfortunately. \u201cThey\u2019ll slow up when their  populations fill,\u201d Giles repeated  his old answers. \u201cWe\u2019re still ahead  in medicine and we\u2019ll get the  other discoveries eventually, without  interrupting the work of making  the Earth fit for our longevity.  We can wait. We\u2019ll have to.\u201d THE YOUNGER man stared  at him with the strange puzzled  look Giles had seen too often  lately. \u201cDamn it, haven\u2019t you read  my report? We know the super-light  drive works! That missile  reached Sirius in less than ten  days. We can have the secret of  this antigravity in less than a  year! We\u2014\u201d \u201cWait a minute.\u201d Giles felt the  thickness pushing back at his  mind and tried to fight it off. He\u2019d  only skimmed the report, but this  made no sense. \u201cYou mean you  can calibrate your guiding devices  accurately enough to get a  missile where you want it and  back?\u201d \u201c What? \u201d Jordan\u2019s voice rattled  the speaker. \u201cOf course not! It  took two accidents to get the  thing back to us\u2014and with a  half-light-year miss that delayed  it about twenty years before the  Procyon shuttle heard its signal.  Pre-setting a course may take  centuries, if we can ever master  it. Even with Sirius expecting the  missiles and ready to cooperate.  I mean the big ship. We\u2019ve had it  drafted for building long enough;  now we can finish it in three  months. We know the drive works.  We know it\u2019s fast enough to reach  Procyon in two weeks. We even  know life can stand the trip. The  rats were unharmed.\u201d Giles shook his head at what  the other was proposing, only  partly believing it. \u201cRats don\u2019t  have minds that could show any  real damage such as the loss of  power to rejuvenate. We can\u2019t put  human pilots into a ship with our  drive until we\u2019ve tested it more  thoroughly, Bill, even if they  could correct for errors on arrival.  Maybe if we put in stronger signaling  transmitters....\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe in two centuries  we\u2019d have a through route charted  to Sirius. And we still wouldn\u2019t  have proved it safe for human  pilots. Mr. Giles, we\u2019ve got to  have the big ship. All we need is one volunteer!\u201d It occurred to Giles then that  the man had been too fired with  the idea to think. He leaned back,  shaking his head again wearily.  \u201cAll right, Bill. Find me one volunteer.  Or how about you? Do  you really want to risk losing the  rest of your life rather than waiting  a couple more centuries until  we know it\u2019s safe? If you do, I\u2019ll  order the big ship.\u201d Jordan opened his mouth and  for a second Giles\u2019 heart caught  in a flux of emotions as the  man\u2019s offer hovered on his lips.  Then the engineer shut his mouth  slowly. The belligerence ran out  of him. He looked sick, for he had no  answer. NO SANE man would risk a  chance for near eternity  against such a relatively short  wait. Heroism had belonged to  those who knew their days were  numbered, anyhow. \u201cForget it, Bill,\u201d Giles advised.  \u201cIt may take longer, but eventually  we\u2019ll find a way. With time  enough, we\u2019re bound to. And  when we do, the ship will be  ready.\u201d The engineer nodded miserably  and clicked off. Giles turned  from the blank screen to stare  out of the windows, while his  hand came up to twist at the lock  of hair over his forehead. Eternity!  They had to plan and build  for it. They couldn\u2019t risk that  plan for short-term benefits. Usually  it was too easy to realize that,  and the sight of the solid, time-enduring  buildings outside should  have given him a sense of security. Today, though, nothing seemed  to help. He felt choked, imprisoned,  somehow lost; the city beyond  the window blurred as he  studied it, and he swung the chair  back so violently that his hand  jerked painfully on the forelock  he\u2019d been twisting. Then he was staring unbelievingly  at the single white hair that  was twisted with the dark ones  between his fingers. Like an automaton, he bent  forward, his other hand groping  for the mirror that should be in  one of the drawers. The dull pain  in his chest sharpened and his  breath was hoarse in his throat,  but he hardly noticed as he found  the mirror and brought it up. His  eyes focused reluctantly. There  were other white strands in his  dark hair. The mirror crashed to the floor  as he staggered out of the office. It was only two blocks to Giles\u2019  residence club, but he had to  stop twice to catch his breath  and fight against the pain that  clawed at his chest. When he  reached the wood-paneled lobby,  he was barely able to stand. Dubbins was at his side almost  at once, with a hand under  his arm to guide him toward his  suite. \u201cLet me help you, sir,\u201d Dubbins  suggested, in the tones  Giles hadn\u2019t heard since the man  had been his valet, back when  it was still possible to find personal  servants. Now he managed  the club on a level of quasi-equality  with the members. For the  moment, though, he\u2019d slipped  back into the old ways. GILES FOUND himself lying  on his couch, partially undressed,  with the pillows just right  and a long drink in his hand. The  alcohol combined with the reaction  from his panic to leave him  almost himself again. After all,  there was nothing to worry about;  Earth\u2019s doctors could cure anything. \u201cI guess you\u2019d better call Dr.  Vincenti,\u201d he decided. Vincenti  was a member and would probably  be the quickest to get. Dubbins shook his head. \u201cDr.  Vincenti isn\u2019t with us, sir. He  left a year ago to visit a son in  the Centauri system. There\u2019s a  Dr. Cobb whose reputation is  very good, sir.\u201d Giles puzzled over it doubtfully.  Vincenti had been an oddly  morose man the last few times  he\u2019d seen him, but that could  hardly explain his taking a twenty-year  shuttle trip for such a  slim reason. It was no concern of  his, though. \u201cDr. Cobb, then,\u201d he  said. Giles heard the other man\u2019s  voice on the study phone, too low  for the words to be distinguishable.  He finished the drink, feeling  still better, and was sitting  up when Dubbins came back. \u201cDr. Cobb wants you to come  to his office at once, sir,\u201d he said,  dropping to his knee to help  Giles with his shoes. \u201cI\u2019d be  pleased to drive you there.\u201d Giles frowned. He\u2019d expected  Cobb to come to him. Then he  grimaced at his own thoughts.  Dubbins\u2019 manners must have carried  him back into the past; doctors  didn\u2019t go in for home visits  now\u2014they preferred to see their  patients in the laboratories that  housed their offices. If this kept  on, he\u2019d be missing the old days  when he\u2019d had a mansion and  counted his wealth in possessions,  instead of the treasures he could  build inside himself for the future  ahead. He was getting positively  childish! Yet he relished the feeling of  having Dubbins drive his car.  More than anything else, he\u2019d  loved being driven. Even after  chauffeurs were a thing of the  past, Harry had driven him  around. Now he\u2019d taken to walking,  as so many others had, for  even with modern safety measures  so strict, there was always  a small chance of some accident  and nobody had any desire to  spend the long future as a cripple. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you, sir,\u201d Dubbins  offered as they stopped beside  the low, massive medical building. It was almost too much consideration.  Giles nodded, got out  and headed down the hall uncertainly.  Just how bad did he  look? Well, he\u2019d soon find out. He located the directory and  finally found the right office, its  reception room wall covered  with all the degrees Dr. Cobb had  picked up in some three hundred  years of practice. Giles felt  better, realizing it wouldn\u2019t be  one of the younger men. COBB APPEARED himself,  before the nurse could take  over, and led Giles into a room  with an old-fashioned desk and  chairs that almost concealed the  cabinets of equipment beyond. He listened as Giles stumbled  out his story. Halfway through,  the nurse took a blood sample  with one of the little mosquito  needles and the machinery behind  the doctor began working on  it. \u201cYour friend told me about the  gray hair, of course,\u201d Cobb said.  At Giles\u2019 look, he smiled faintly.  \u201cSurely you didn\u2019t think people  could miss that in this day and  age? Let\u2019s see it.\u201d He inspected it and began  making tests. Some were older  than Giles could remember\u2014knee  reflex, blood pressure, pulse  and fluoroscope. Others involved  complicated little gadgets that  ran over his body, while meters  bobbed and wiggled. The blood  check came through and Cobb  studied it, to go back and make  further inspections of his own. At last he nodded slowly.  \u201cHyper-catabolism, of course. I  thought it might be. How long  since you had your last rejuvenation?  And who gave it?\u201d \u201cAbout ten years ago,\u201d Giles  answered. He found his identity  card and passed it over, while  the doctor studied it. \u201cMy sixteenth.\u201d It wasn\u2019t going right. He could  feel it. Some of the panic symptoms  were returning; the pulse in  his neck was pounding and his  breath was growing difficult.  Sweat ran down his sides from  his armpit and he wiped his palms  against his coat. \u201cAny particular emotional  strain when you were treated\u2014some  major upset in your life?\u201d  Cobb asked. Giles thought as carefully as  he could, but he remembered  nothing like that. \u201cYou mean\u2014it  didn\u2019t take? But I never had  any trouble, Doctor. I was one of  the first million cases, when a  lot of people couldn\u2019t rejuvenate  at all, and I had no trouble even  then.\u201d Cobb considered it, hesitated as  if making up his mind to be frank  against his better judgment. \u201cI  can\u2019t see any other explanation.  You\u2019ve got a slight case of angina\u2014nothing  serious, but quite definite\u2014as  well as other signs  of aging. I\u2019m afraid the treatment  didn\u2019t take fully. It might have  been some unconscious block  on your part, some infection not  diagnosed at the time, or even a  fault in the treatment. That\u2019s  pretty rare, but we can\u2019t neglect  the possibility.\u201d HE STUDIED his charts again  and then smiled. \u201cSo we\u2019ll  give you another treatment. Any  reason you can\u2019t begin immediately?\u201d Giles remembered that Dubbins  was waiting for him, but this  was more important. It hadn\u2019t  been a joke about his growing old,  after all. But now, in a few days,  he\u2019d be his old\u2014no, of course  not\u2014his young self again! They went down the hall to  another office, where Giles waited  outside while Cobb conferred  with another doctor and technician,  with much waving of charts.  He resented every second of it.  It was as if the almost forgotten  specter of age stood beside him,  counting the seconds. But at last  they were through and he was led  into the quiet rejuvenation room,  where the clamps were adjusted  about his head and the earpieces  were fitted. The drugs were shot  painlessly into his arm and the  light-pulser was adjusted to his  brain-wave pattern. It had been nothing like this his  first time. Then it had required  months of mental training, followed  by crude mechanical and  drug hypnosis for other months.  Somewhere in every human brain  lay the memory of what his cells  had been like when he was young.  Or perhaps it lay in the cells  themselves, with the brain as only  a linkage to it. They\u2019d discovered  that, and the fact that the mind  could effect physical changes in  the body. Even such things as  cancer could be willed out of existence\u2014provided  the brain  could be reached far below the  conscious level and forced to  operate. There had been impossible  faith cures for millenia\u2014cataracts  removed from blinded eyes  within minutes, even\u2014but finding  the mechanism in the brain  that worked those miracles had  taken an incredible amount of  study and finding a means of  bringing it under control had  taken even longer. Now they did it with dozens of  mechanical aids in addition to  the hypnotic instructions\u2014and  did it usually in a single sitting,  with the full transformation of  the body taking less than a week  after the treatment! But with all the equipment, it  wasn\u2019t impossible for a mistake  to happen. It had been no fault of  his ... he was sure of that ... his  mind was easy to reach ... he  could relax so easily.... He came out of it without  even a headache, while they were  removing the probes, but the  fatigue on the operator\u2019s face told  him it had been a long and difficult  job. He stretched experimentally,  with the eternal unconscious  expectation that he would  find himself suddenly young  again. But that, of course, was ridiculous.  It took days for the mind  to work on all the cells and to  repair the damage of time. COBB LED him back to the  first office, where he was given  an injection of some kind and  another sample of his blood was  taken, while the earlier tests were  repeated. But finally the doctor  nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s all for now, Mr. Giles.  You might drop in tomorrow  morning, after I\u2019ve had a chance  to complete my study of all this.  We\u2019ll know by then whether you\u2019ll  need more treatment. Ten o\u2019clock  okay?\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ll be all right?\u201d Cobb smiled the automatic reassurance  of his profession. \u201cWe  haven\u2019t lost a patient in two hundred  years, to my knowledge.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d said Giles. \u201cTen  o\u2019clock is fine.\u201d Dubbins was still waiting, reading  a paper whose headlined feature  carried a glowing account of  the discovery of the super-light  missile and what it might mean.  He took a quick look at Giles and  pointed to it. \u201cGreat work, Mr.  Giles. Maybe we\u2019ll all get to see  some of those other worlds yet.\u201d  Then he studied Giles more carefully.  \u201cEverything\u2019s in good shape  now, sir?\u201d \u201cThe doctor says everything\u2019s  going to be fine,\u201d Giles answered. It was then he realized for the  first time that Cobb had said no  such thing. A statement that  lightning had never struck a  house was no guarantee that it  never would. It was an evasion  meant to give such an impression. The worry nagged at him all  the way back. Word had already  gone around the club that he\u2019d  had some kind of attack and  there were endless questions that  kept it on his mind. And even  when it had been covered and  recovered, he could still sense the  glances of the others, as if he  were Vincenti in one of the man\u2019s  more morose moods. He found a single table in the  dining room and picked his way  through the meal, listening to  the conversation about him only  when it was necessary because  someone called across to him.  Ordinarily, he was quick to support  the idea of clubs in place  of private families. A man here  could choose his group and grow  into them. Yet he wasn\u2019t swallowed  by them, as he might be by  a family. Giles had been living  here for nearly a century now and  he\u2019d never regretted it. But tonight  his own group irritated him. He puzzled over it, finding no  real reason. Certainly they weren\u2019t  forcing themselves on him. He  remembered once when he\u2019d had  a cold, before they finally licked  that; Harry had been a complete  nuisance, running around with  various nostrums, giving him no  peace. Constant questions about  how he felt, constant little looks  of worry\u2014until he\u2019d been ready  to yell at the boy. In fact, he  had. Funny, he couldn\u2019t picture really  losing his temper here. Families  did odd things to a man. HE LISTENED to a few of  the discussions after the dinner,  but he\u2019d heard them all before,  except for one about the  super-speed drive, and there he  had no wish to talk until he could  study the final report. He gave up  at last and went to his own suite.  What he needed was a good  night\u2019s sleep after a little relaxation. Even that failed him, though.  He\u2019d developed one of the finest  chess collections in the world, but  tonight it held no interest. And  when he drew out his tools and  tried working on the delicate,  lovely jade for the set he was  carving his hands seemed to be  all thumbs. None of the other interests  he\u2019d developed through  the years helped to add to the  richness of living now. He gave it up and went to bed\u2014to  have the fragment of that  song pop into his head. Now there  was no escaping it. Something  about the years\u2014or was it days\u2014dwindling  down to something  or other. Could they really dwindle  down? Suppose he couldn\u2019t rejuvenate  all the way? He knew  that there were some people who  didn\u2019t respond as well as others.  Sol Graves, for instance. He\u2019d  been fifty when he finally learned  how to work with the doctors and  they could only bring him back to  about thirty, instead of the normal  early twenties. Would that  reduce the slice of eternity that  rejuvenation meant? And what  had happened to Sol? Or suppose it wasn\u2019t rejuvenation,  after all; suppose something  had gone wrong with him  permanently? He fought that off, but he  couldn\u2019t escape the nagging  doubts at the doctor\u2019s words. He got up once to stare at himself  in the mirror. Ten hours had  gone by and there should have  been some signs of improvement.  He couldn\u2019t be sure, though,  whether there were or not. He looked no better the next  morning when he finally dragged  himself up from the little sleep  he\u2019d managed to get. The hollows  were still there and the circles  under his eyes. He searched for  the gray in his hair, but the traitorous  strands had been removed  at the doctor\u2019s office and he could  find no new ones. He looked into the dining room  and then went by hastily. He  wanted no solicitous glances this  morning. Drat it, maybe he  should move out. Maybe trying  family life again would give him  some new interests. Amanda probably  would be willing to marry  him; she\u2019d hinted at a date once. He stopped, shocked by the  awareness that he hadn\u2019t been out  with a woman for.... He couldn\u2019t remember how  long it had been. Nor why. \u201cIn the spring, a young man\u2019s  fancy,\u201d he quoted to himself, and  then shuddered. It hadn\u2019t been that kind of  spring for him\u2014not this rejuvenation  nor the last, nor the one  before that. GILES TRIED to stop scaring  himself and partially succeeded,  until he reached the doctor\u2019s  office. Then it was no longer necessary  to frighten himself. The  wrongness was too strong, no matter  how professional Cobb\u2019s smile! He didn\u2019t hear the preliminary  words. He watched the smile vanish  as the stack of reports came  out. There was no nurse here  now. The machines were quiet\u2014and  all the doors were shut. Giles shook his head, interrupting  the doctor\u2019s technical jargon.  Now that he knew there was reason  for his fear, it seemed to  vanish, leaving a coldness that  numbed him. \u201cI\u2019d rather know the whole  truth,\u201d he said. His voice sounded  dead in his ears. \u201cThe worst first.  The rejuvenation...?\u201d Cobb sighed and yet seemed relieved.  \u201cFailed.\u201d He stopped, and  his hands touched the reports on  his desk. \u201cCompletely,\u201d he added  in a low, defeated tone. \u201cBut I thought that was impossible!\u201d \u201cSo did I. I wouldn\u2019t believe  it even yet\u2014but now I find it  isn\u2019t the first case. I spent the  night at Medical Center going up  the ranks until I found men who  really know about it. And now I  wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d His voice ran  down and he gathered himself together  by an effort. \u201cIt\u2019s a shock  to me, too, Mr. Giles. But\u2014well,  to simplify it, no memory is perfect\u2014even  cellular memory. It  loses a little each time. And the  effect is cumulative. It\u2019s like an  asymptotic curve\u2014the further it  goes, the steeper the curve. And\u2014well,  you\u2019ve passed too far.\u201d He faced away from Giles,  dropping the reports into a  drawer and locking it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t  supposed to tell you, of course.  It\u2019s going to be tough enough  when they\u2019re ready to let people  know. But you aren\u2019t the first and  you won\u2019t be the last, if that\u2019s any  consolation. We\u2019ve got a longer  time scale than we used to have\u2014but  it\u2019s in centuries, not in  eons. For everybody, not just  you.\u201d It was no consolation. Giles  nodded mechanically. \u201cI won\u2019t  talk, of course. How\u2014how long?\u201d Cobb spread his hands unhappily.  \u201cThirty years, maybe. But  we can make them better. Geriatric  knowledge is still on record.  We can fix the heart and all the  rest. You\u2019ll be in good physical  condition, better than your grandfather\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd then....\u201d Giles couldn\u2019t  pronounce the words. He\u2019d grown  old and he\u2019d grow older. And  eventually he\u2019d die! An immortal man had suddenly  found death hovering on his  trail. The years had dwindled and  gone, and only a few were left. He stood up, holding out his  hand. \u201cThank you, Doctor,\u201d he  said, and was surprised to find  he meant it. The man had done  all he could and had at least  saved him the suspense of growing  doubt and horrible eventual  discovery. OUTSIDE ON the street, he  looked up at the Sun and  then at the buildings built to last  for thousands of years. Their  eternity was no longer a part of  him. Even his car would outlast him. He climbed into it, still partly  numbed, and began driving mechanically,  no longer wondering  about the dangers that might possibly  arise. Those wouldn\u2019t matter  much now. For a man who  had thought of living almost forever,  thirty years was too short  a time to count. He was passing near the club  and started to slow. Then he  went on without stopping. He  wanted no chance to have them  asking questions he couldn\u2019t answer.  It was none of their business.  Dubbins had been kind\u2014but  now Giles wanted no kindness. The street led to the office  and he drove on. What else was  there for him? There, at least, he  could still fill his time with work\u2014work  that might even be useful.  In the future, men would  need the super-light drive if they  were to span much more of the  Universe than now. And he could  speed up the work in some ways  still, even if he could never see  its finish. It would be cold comfort but it  was something. And he might  keep busy enough to forget sometimes  that the years were gone  for him. Automatic habit carried him  through the office again, to Amanda\u2019s  desk, where her worry was  still riding her. He managed a  grin and somehow the right words  came to his lips. \u201cI saw the doctor,  Amanda, so you can stop  figuring ways to get me there.\u201d She smiled back suddenly, without  feigning it. \u201cThen you\u2019re all  right?\u201d \u201cAs all right as I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d  he told her. \u201cThey tell me I\u2019m just  growing old.\u201d This time her laugh was heartier.  He caught himself before he  could echo her mirth in a different  voice and went inside where she  had the coffee waiting for him. Oddly, it still tasted good to  him. The projection was off, he saw,  wondering whether he\u2019d left it on  or not. He snapped the switch and  saw the screen light up, with the  people still in the odd, wheelless  vehicle on the alien planet. FOR A long moment, he stared  at the picture without thinking,  and then bent closer. Harry\u2019s  face hadn\u2019t changed much. Giles  had almost forgotten it, but there  was still the same grin there. And  his grandchildren had a touch  of it, too. And of their grandfather\u2019s  nose, he thought. Funny,  he\u2019d never seen even pictures of  his other grandchildren. Family  ties melted away too fast for interstellar  travel. Yet there seemed to be no  slackening of them in Harry\u2019s  case, and somehow it looked like  a family, rather than a mere  group. A very pleasant family in  a very pleasant world. He read Harry\u2019s note again,  with its praise for the planet and  its invitation. He wondered if  Dr. Vincenti had received an invitation  like that, before he left.  Or had he even been one of those  to whom the same report had  been delivered by some doctor?  It didn\u2019t matter, but it would explain  things, at least. Twenty years to Centaurus,  while the years dwindled down\u2014 Then abruptly the line finished  itself. \u201cThe years dwindle down  to a precious few....\u201d he remembered.  \u201cA precious few.\u201d Those dwindling years had  been precious once. He unexpectedly  recalled his own grandfather  holding him on an old  knee and slipping him candy  that was forbidden. The years  seemed precious to the old man  then. Amanda\u2019s voice came abruptly  over the intercom. \u201cJordan wants  to talk to you,\u201d she said, and the  irritation was sharp in her voice.  \u201cHe won\u2019t take no!\u201d Giles shrugged and reached for  the projector, to cut it off. Then,  on impulse, he set it back to the  picture, studying the group again  as he switched on Jordan\u2019s wire. But he didn\u2019t wait for the hot  words about whatever was the  trouble. \u201cBill,\u201d he said, \u201cstart getting  the big ship into production. I\u2019ve  found a volunteer.\u201d He\u2019d been driven to it, he knew,  as he watched the man\u2019s amazed  face snap from the screen. From  the first suspicion of his trouble,  something inside him had been  forcing him to make this decision.  And maybe it would do no good.  Maybe the ship would fail. But  thirty years was a number a man  could risk. If he made it, though.... Well, he\u2019d see those grandchildren  of his this year\u2014and  Harry. Maybe he\u2019d even tell  Harry the truth, once they got  done celebrating the reunion. And  there\u2019d be other grandchildren.  With the ship, he\u2019d have time  enough to look them up. Plenty  of time! Thirty years was a long time,  when he stopped to think of it. \u2014LESTER DEL REY \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does Giles change with the knowledge of his aging? \n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He shows a much greater appreciation for every aspect of his life. \".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels a new fondness for his son and family.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He feels a new fondness for his son and family.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He feels a new fondness for his son and family.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

By LESTER DEL REY Illustrated by JOHNS NEARLY TWO hundred  years of habit carried the  chairman of Exodus Corporation  through the morning ritual  of crossing the executive  floor. Giles made the expected  comments, smiled the proper  smiles and greeted his staff by  the right names, but it was purely  automatic. Somehow, thinking  had grown difficult in the mornings  recently. Inside his private office, he  dropped all pretense and slumped  into the padding of his chair, gasping  for breath and feeling his  heart hammering in his chest.  He\u2019d been a fool to come to work,  he realized. But with the Procyon  shuttle arriving yesterday, there  was no telling what might turn  up. Besides, that fool of a medicist  had sworn the shot would  cure any allergy or asthma. Giles heard his secretary come  in, but it wasn\u2019t until the smell  of the coffee reached his nose  that he looked up. She handed  him a filled cup and set the carafe  down on the age-polished surface  of the big desk. She watched  solicitously as he drank. \u201cThat bad, Arthur?\u201d she asked. \u201cJust a little tired,\u201d he told  her, refilling the cup. She\u2019d made  the coffee stronger than usual  and it seemed to cut through  some of the thickness in his head.  \u201cI guess I\u2019m getting old, Amanda.\u201d She smiled dutifully at the  time-worn joke, but he knew she  wasn\u2019t fooled. She\u2019d cycled to  middle age four times in her  job and she probably knew him  better than he knew himself\u2014which  wouldn\u2019t be hard, he  thought. He\u2019d hardly recognized  the stranger in the mirror as he  tried to shave. His normal thinness  had looked almost gaunt  and there were hollows in his  face and circles under his eyes.  Even his hair had seemed thinner,  though that, of course, was  impossible. \u201cAnything urgent on the Procyon  shuttle?\u201d he asked as she  continue staring at him with worried  eyes. SHE JERKED her gaze away  guiltily and turned to the incoming  basket. \u201cMostly drugs for  experimenting. A personal letter  for you, relayed from some place  I never heard of. And one of the  super-light missiles! They found  it drifting half a light-year out  and captured it. Jordan\u2019s got a  report on it and he\u2019s going crazy.  But if you don\u2019t feel well\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m all right!\u201d he told her  sharply. Then he steadied himself  and managed to smile. \u201cThanks  for the coffee, Amanda.\u201d She accepted dismissal reluctantly.  When she was gone, he  sat gazing at the report from Jordan  at Research. For eighty years now, they\u2019d  been sending out the little ships  that vanished at greater than the  speed of light, equipped with  every conceivable device to make  them return automatically after  taking pictures of wherever they  arrived. So far, none had ever returned  or been located. This was  the first hope they\u2019d found that  the century-long trips between  stars in the ponderous shuttles  might be ended and he should  have been filled with excitement  at Jordan\u2019s hasty preliminary report. He leafed through it. The little  ship apparently had been picked  up by accident when it almost  collided with a Sirius-local ship.  Scientists there had puzzled over  it, reset it and sent it back. The  two white rats on it had still been  alive. Giles dropped the report wearily  and picked up the personal  message that had come on the  shuttle. He fingered the microstrip  inside while he drank another  coffee, and finally pulled  out the microviewer. There were  three frames to the message, he  saw with some surprise. He didn\u2019t need to see the signature  on the first projection.  Only his youngest son would have  sent an elaborate tercentenary  greeting verse\u2014one that would  arrive ninety years too late! Harry  had been born just before Earth  passed the drastic birth limitation  act and his mother had  spoiled him. He\u2019d even tried to  avoid the compulsory emigration  draft and stay on with his mother.  It had been the bitter quarrels  over that which had finally  broken Giles\u2019 fifth marriage. Oddly enough, the message in  the next frame showed none of  that. Harry had nothing but  praise for the solar system where  he\u2019d been sent. He barely mentioned  being married on the way  or his dozen children, but filled  most of the frame with glowing  description and a plea for his  father to join him there! GILES SNORTED and turned  to the third frame, which  showed a group picture of the  family in some sort of vehicle,  against the background of an alien  but attractive world. He had no desire to spend  ninety years cooped up with a  bunch of callow young emigrants,  even in one of the improved Exodus  shuttles. And even if Exodus  ever got the super-light  drive working, there was no reason  he should give up his work.  The discovery that men could  live practically forever had put  an end to most family ties; sentiment  wore thin in half a century\u2014which  wasn\u2019t much time  now, though it had once seemed  long enough. Strange how the years seemed  to get shorter as their number increased.  There\u2019d been a song  once\u2014something about the years  dwindling down. He groped for  the lines and couldn\u2019t remember.  Drat it! Now he\u2019d probably lie  awake most of the night again,  trying to recall them. The outside line buzzed musically,  flashing Research\u2019s number.  Giles grunted in irritation. He  wasn\u2019t ready to face Jordan yet.  But he shrugged and pressed the  button. The intense face that looked  from the screen was frowning as  Jordan\u2019s eyes seemed to sweep  around the room. He was still  young\u2014one of the few under  a hundred who\u2019d escaped deportation  because of special ability\u2014and  patience was still foreign to  him. Then the frown vanished as  an expression of shock replaced  it, and Giles felt a sinking sensation.  If he looked that bad\u2014 But Jordan wasn\u2019t looking at  him; the man\u2019s interest lay in the  projected picture from Harry, across  the desk from the communicator. \u201cAntigravity!\u201d His voice was  unbelieving as he turned his head  to face the older man. \u201cWhat  world is that?\u201d Giles forced his attention on  the picture again and this time  he noticed the vehicle shown. It  was enough like an old model  Earth conveyance to pass casual  inspection, but it floated wheellessly  above the ground. Faint  blur lines indicated it had been  moving when the picture was  taken. \u201cOne of my sons\u2014\u201d Giles  started to answer. \u201cI could find  the star\u2019s designation....\u201d Jordan cursed harshly. \u201cSo we  can send a message on the shuttle,  begging for their secret in a  couple of hundred years! While  a hundred other worlds make a  thousand major discoveries they  don\u2019t bother reporting! Can\u2019t the  Council see anything ?\u201d Giles had heard it all before.  Earth was becoming a backwater  world; no real progress had been  made in two centuries; the young  men were sent out as soon as  their first fifty years of education  were finished, and the older men  were too conservative for really  new thinking. There was a measure  of truth in it, unfortunately. \u201cThey\u2019ll slow up when their  populations fill,\u201d Giles repeated  his old answers. \u201cWe\u2019re still ahead  in medicine and we\u2019ll get the  other discoveries eventually, without  interrupting the work of making  the Earth fit for our longevity.  We can wait. We\u2019ll have to.\u201d THE YOUNGER man stared  at him with the strange puzzled  look Giles had seen too often  lately. \u201cDamn it, haven\u2019t you read  my report? We know the super-light  drive works! That missile  reached Sirius in less than ten  days. We can have the secret of  this antigravity in less than a  year! We\u2014\u201d \u201cWait a minute.\u201d Giles felt the  thickness pushing back at his  mind and tried to fight it off. He\u2019d  only skimmed the report, but this  made no sense. \u201cYou mean you  can calibrate your guiding devices  accurately enough to get a  missile where you want it and  back?\u201d \u201c What? \u201d Jordan\u2019s voice rattled  the speaker. \u201cOf course not! It  took two accidents to get the  thing back to us\u2014and with a  half-light-year miss that delayed  it about twenty years before the  Procyon shuttle heard its signal.  Pre-setting a course may take  centuries, if we can ever master  it. Even with Sirius expecting the  missiles and ready to cooperate.  I mean the big ship. We\u2019ve had it  drafted for building long enough;  now we can finish it in three  months. We know the drive works.  We know it\u2019s fast enough to reach  Procyon in two weeks. We even  know life can stand the trip. The  rats were unharmed.\u201d Giles shook his head at what  the other was proposing, only  partly believing it. \u201cRats don\u2019t  have minds that could show any  real damage such as the loss of  power to rejuvenate. We can\u2019t put  human pilots into a ship with our  drive until we\u2019ve tested it more  thoroughly, Bill, even if they  could correct for errors on arrival.  Maybe if we put in stronger signaling  transmitters....\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe in two centuries  we\u2019d have a through route charted  to Sirius. And we still wouldn\u2019t  have proved it safe for human  pilots. Mr. Giles, we\u2019ve got to  have the big ship. All we need is one volunteer!\u201d It occurred to Giles then that  the man had been too fired with  the idea to think. He leaned back,  shaking his head again wearily.  \u201cAll right, Bill. Find me one volunteer.  Or how about you? Do  you really want to risk losing the  rest of your life rather than waiting  a couple more centuries until  we know it\u2019s safe? If you do, I\u2019ll  order the big ship.\u201d Jordan opened his mouth and  for a second Giles\u2019 heart caught  in a flux of emotions as the  man\u2019s offer hovered on his lips.  Then the engineer shut his mouth  slowly. The belligerence ran out  of him. He looked sick, for he had no  answer. NO SANE man would risk a  chance for near eternity  against such a relatively short  wait. Heroism had belonged to  those who knew their days were  numbered, anyhow. \u201cForget it, Bill,\u201d Giles advised.  \u201cIt may take longer, but eventually  we\u2019ll find a way. With time  enough, we\u2019re bound to. And  when we do, the ship will be  ready.\u201d The engineer nodded miserably  and clicked off. Giles turned  from the blank screen to stare  out of the windows, while his  hand came up to twist at the lock  of hair over his forehead. Eternity!  They had to plan and build  for it. They couldn\u2019t risk that  plan for short-term benefits. Usually  it was too easy to realize that,  and the sight of the solid, time-enduring  buildings outside should  have given him a sense of security. Today, though, nothing seemed  to help. He felt choked, imprisoned,  somehow lost; the city beyond  the window blurred as he  studied it, and he swung the chair  back so violently that his hand  jerked painfully on the forelock  he\u2019d been twisting. Then he was staring unbelievingly  at the single white hair that  was twisted with the dark ones  between his fingers. Like an automaton, he bent  forward, his other hand groping  for the mirror that should be in  one of the drawers. The dull pain  in his chest sharpened and his  breath was hoarse in his throat,  but he hardly noticed as he found  the mirror and brought it up. His  eyes focused reluctantly. There  were other white strands in his  dark hair. The mirror crashed to the floor  as he staggered out of the office. It was only two blocks to Giles\u2019  residence club, but he had to  stop twice to catch his breath  and fight against the pain that  clawed at his chest. When he  reached the wood-paneled lobby,  he was barely able to stand. Dubbins was at his side almost  at once, with a hand under  his arm to guide him toward his  suite. \u201cLet me help you, sir,\u201d Dubbins  suggested, in the tones  Giles hadn\u2019t heard since the man  had been his valet, back when  it was still possible to find personal  servants. Now he managed  the club on a level of quasi-equality  with the members. For the  moment, though, he\u2019d slipped  back into the old ways. GILES FOUND himself lying  on his couch, partially undressed,  with the pillows just right  and a long drink in his hand. The  alcohol combined with the reaction  from his panic to leave him  almost himself again. After all,  there was nothing to worry about;  Earth\u2019s doctors could cure anything. \u201cI guess you\u2019d better call Dr.  Vincenti,\u201d he decided. Vincenti  was a member and would probably  be the quickest to get. Dubbins shook his head. \u201cDr.  Vincenti isn\u2019t with us, sir. He  left a year ago to visit a son in  the Centauri system. There\u2019s a  Dr. Cobb whose reputation is  very good, sir.\u201d Giles puzzled over it doubtfully.  Vincenti had been an oddly  morose man the last few times  he\u2019d seen him, but that could  hardly explain his taking a twenty-year  shuttle trip for such a  slim reason. It was no concern of  his, though. \u201cDr. Cobb, then,\u201d he  said. Giles heard the other man\u2019s  voice on the study phone, too low  for the words to be distinguishable.  He finished the drink, feeling  still better, and was sitting  up when Dubbins came back. \u201cDr. Cobb wants you to come  to his office at once, sir,\u201d he said,  dropping to his knee to help  Giles with his shoes. \u201cI\u2019d be  pleased to drive you there.\u201d Giles frowned. He\u2019d expected  Cobb to come to him. Then he  grimaced at his own thoughts.  Dubbins\u2019 manners must have carried  him back into the past; doctors  didn\u2019t go in for home visits  now\u2014they preferred to see their  patients in the laboratories that  housed their offices. If this kept  on, he\u2019d be missing the old days  when he\u2019d had a mansion and  counted his wealth in possessions,  instead of the treasures he could  build inside himself for the future  ahead. He was getting positively  childish! Yet he relished the feeling of  having Dubbins drive his car.  More than anything else, he\u2019d  loved being driven. Even after  chauffeurs were a thing of the  past, Harry had driven him  around. Now he\u2019d taken to walking,  as so many others had, for  even with modern safety measures  so strict, there was always  a small chance of some accident  and nobody had any desire to  spend the long future as a cripple. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you, sir,\u201d Dubbins  offered as they stopped beside  the low, massive medical building. It was almost too much consideration.  Giles nodded, got out  and headed down the hall uncertainly.  Just how bad did he  look? Well, he\u2019d soon find out. He located the directory and  finally found the right office, its  reception room wall covered  with all the degrees Dr. Cobb had  picked up in some three hundred  years of practice. Giles felt  better, realizing it wouldn\u2019t be  one of the younger men. COBB APPEARED himself,  before the nurse could take  over, and led Giles into a room  with an old-fashioned desk and  chairs that almost concealed the  cabinets of equipment beyond. He listened as Giles stumbled  out his story. Halfway through,  the nurse took a blood sample  with one of the little mosquito  needles and the machinery behind  the doctor began working on  it. \u201cYour friend told me about the  gray hair, of course,\u201d Cobb said.  At Giles\u2019 look, he smiled faintly.  \u201cSurely you didn\u2019t think people  could miss that in this day and  age? Let\u2019s see it.\u201d He inspected it and began  making tests. Some were older  than Giles could remember\u2014knee  reflex, blood pressure, pulse  and fluoroscope. Others involved  complicated little gadgets that  ran over his body, while meters  bobbed and wiggled. The blood  check came through and Cobb  studied it, to go back and make  further inspections of his own. At last he nodded slowly.  \u201cHyper-catabolism, of course. I  thought it might be. How long  since you had your last rejuvenation?  And who gave it?\u201d \u201cAbout ten years ago,\u201d Giles  answered. He found his identity  card and passed it over, while  the doctor studied it. \u201cMy sixteenth.\u201d It wasn\u2019t going right. He could  feel it. Some of the panic symptoms  were returning; the pulse in  his neck was pounding and his  breath was growing difficult.  Sweat ran down his sides from  his armpit and he wiped his palms  against his coat. \u201cAny particular emotional  strain when you were treated\u2014some  major upset in your life?\u201d  Cobb asked. Giles thought as carefully as  he could, but he remembered  nothing like that. \u201cYou mean\u2014it  didn\u2019t take? But I never had  any trouble, Doctor. I was one of  the first million cases, when a  lot of people couldn\u2019t rejuvenate  at all, and I had no trouble even  then.\u201d Cobb considered it, hesitated as  if making up his mind to be frank  against his better judgment. \u201cI  can\u2019t see any other explanation.  You\u2019ve got a slight case of angina\u2014nothing  serious, but quite definite\u2014as  well as other signs  of aging. I\u2019m afraid the treatment  didn\u2019t take fully. It might have  been some unconscious block  on your part, some infection not  diagnosed at the time, or even a  fault in the treatment. That\u2019s  pretty rare, but we can\u2019t neglect  the possibility.\u201d HE STUDIED his charts again  and then smiled. \u201cSo we\u2019ll  give you another treatment. Any  reason you can\u2019t begin immediately?\u201d Giles remembered that Dubbins  was waiting for him, but this  was more important. It hadn\u2019t  been a joke about his growing old,  after all. But now, in a few days,  he\u2019d be his old\u2014no, of course  not\u2014his young self again! They went down the hall to  another office, where Giles waited  outside while Cobb conferred  with another doctor and technician,  with much waving of charts.  He resented every second of it.  It was as if the almost forgotten  specter of age stood beside him,  counting the seconds. But at last  they were through and he was led  into the quiet rejuvenation room,  where the clamps were adjusted  about his head and the earpieces  were fitted. The drugs were shot  painlessly into his arm and the  light-pulser was adjusted to his  brain-wave pattern. It had been nothing like this his  first time. Then it had required  months of mental training, followed  by crude mechanical and  drug hypnosis for other months.  Somewhere in every human brain  lay the memory of what his cells  had been like when he was young.  Or perhaps it lay in the cells  themselves, with the brain as only  a linkage to it. They\u2019d discovered  that, and the fact that the mind  could effect physical changes in  the body. Even such things as  cancer could be willed out of existence\u2014provided  the brain  could be reached far below the  conscious level and forced to  operate. There had been impossible  faith cures for millenia\u2014cataracts  removed from blinded eyes  within minutes, even\u2014but finding  the mechanism in the brain  that worked those miracles had  taken an incredible amount of  study and finding a means of  bringing it under control had  taken even longer. Now they did it with dozens of  mechanical aids in addition to  the hypnotic instructions\u2014and  did it usually in a single sitting,  with the full transformation of  the body taking less than a week  after the treatment! But with all the equipment, it  wasn\u2019t impossible for a mistake  to happen. It had been no fault of  his ... he was sure of that ... his  mind was easy to reach ... he  could relax so easily.... He came out of it without  even a headache, while they were  removing the probes, but the  fatigue on the operator\u2019s face told  him it had been a long and difficult  job. He stretched experimentally,  with the eternal unconscious  expectation that he would  find himself suddenly young  again. But that, of course, was ridiculous.  It took days for the mind  to work on all the cells and to  repair the damage of time. COBB LED him back to the  first office, where he was given  an injection of some kind and  another sample of his blood was  taken, while the earlier tests were  repeated. But finally the doctor  nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s all for now, Mr. Giles.  You might drop in tomorrow  morning, after I\u2019ve had a chance  to complete my study of all this.  We\u2019ll know by then whether you\u2019ll  need more treatment. Ten o\u2019clock  okay?\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ll be all right?\u201d Cobb smiled the automatic reassurance  of his profession. \u201cWe  haven\u2019t lost a patient in two hundred  years, to my knowledge.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d said Giles. \u201cTen  o\u2019clock is fine.\u201d Dubbins was still waiting, reading  a paper whose headlined feature  carried a glowing account of  the discovery of the super-light  missile and what it might mean.  He took a quick look at Giles and  pointed to it. \u201cGreat work, Mr.  Giles. Maybe we\u2019ll all get to see  some of those other worlds yet.\u201d  Then he studied Giles more carefully.  \u201cEverything\u2019s in good shape  now, sir?\u201d \u201cThe doctor says everything\u2019s  going to be fine,\u201d Giles answered. It was then he realized for the  first time that Cobb had said no  such thing. A statement that  lightning had never struck a  house was no guarantee that it  never would. It was an evasion  meant to give such an impression. The worry nagged at him all  the way back. Word had already  gone around the club that he\u2019d  had some kind of attack and  there were endless questions that  kept it on his mind. And even  when it had been covered and  recovered, he could still sense the  glances of the others, as if he  were Vincenti in one of the man\u2019s  more morose moods. He found a single table in the  dining room and picked his way  through the meal, listening to  the conversation about him only  when it was necessary because  someone called across to him.  Ordinarily, he was quick to support  the idea of clubs in place  of private families. A man here  could choose his group and grow  into them. Yet he wasn\u2019t swallowed  by them, as he might be by  a family. Giles had been living  here for nearly a century now and  he\u2019d never regretted it. But tonight  his own group irritated him. He puzzled over it, finding no  real reason. Certainly they weren\u2019t  forcing themselves on him. He  remembered once when he\u2019d had  a cold, before they finally licked  that; Harry had been a complete  nuisance, running around with  various nostrums, giving him no  peace. Constant questions about  how he felt, constant little looks  of worry\u2014until he\u2019d been ready  to yell at the boy. In fact, he  had. Funny, he couldn\u2019t picture really  losing his temper here. Families  did odd things to a man. HE LISTENED to a few of  the discussions after the dinner,  but he\u2019d heard them all before,  except for one about the  super-speed drive, and there he  had no wish to talk until he could  study the final report. He gave up  at last and went to his own suite.  What he needed was a good  night\u2019s sleep after a little relaxation. Even that failed him, though.  He\u2019d developed one of the finest  chess collections in the world, but  tonight it held no interest. And  when he drew out his tools and  tried working on the delicate,  lovely jade for the set he was  carving his hands seemed to be  all thumbs. None of the other interests  he\u2019d developed through  the years helped to add to the  richness of living now. He gave it up and went to bed\u2014to  have the fragment of that  song pop into his head. Now there  was no escaping it. Something  about the years\u2014or was it days\u2014dwindling  down to something  or other. Could they really dwindle  down? Suppose he couldn\u2019t rejuvenate  all the way? He knew  that there were some people who  didn\u2019t respond as well as others.  Sol Graves, for instance. He\u2019d  been fifty when he finally learned  how to work with the doctors and  they could only bring him back to  about thirty, instead of the normal  early twenties. Would that  reduce the slice of eternity that  rejuvenation meant? And what  had happened to Sol? Or suppose it wasn\u2019t rejuvenation,  after all; suppose something  had gone wrong with him  permanently? He fought that off, but he  couldn\u2019t escape the nagging  doubts at the doctor\u2019s words. He got up once to stare at himself  in the mirror. Ten hours had  gone by and there should have  been some signs of improvement.  He couldn\u2019t be sure, though,  whether there were or not. He looked no better the next  morning when he finally dragged  himself up from the little sleep  he\u2019d managed to get. The hollows  were still there and the circles  under his eyes. He searched for  the gray in his hair, but the traitorous  strands had been removed  at the doctor\u2019s office and he could  find no new ones. He looked into the dining room  and then went by hastily. He  wanted no solicitous glances this  morning. Drat it, maybe he  should move out. Maybe trying  family life again would give him  some new interests. Amanda probably  would be willing to marry  him; she\u2019d hinted at a date once. He stopped, shocked by the  awareness that he hadn\u2019t been out  with a woman for.... He couldn\u2019t remember how  long it had been. Nor why. \u201cIn the spring, a young man\u2019s  fancy,\u201d he quoted to himself, and  then shuddered. It hadn\u2019t been that kind of  spring for him\u2014not this rejuvenation  nor the last, nor the one  before that. GILES TRIED to stop scaring  himself and partially succeeded,  until he reached the doctor\u2019s  office. Then it was no longer necessary  to frighten himself. The  wrongness was too strong, no matter  how professional Cobb\u2019s smile! He didn\u2019t hear the preliminary  words. He watched the smile vanish  as the stack of reports came  out. There was no nurse here  now. The machines were quiet\u2014and  all the doors were shut. Giles shook his head, interrupting  the doctor\u2019s technical jargon.  Now that he knew there was reason  for his fear, it seemed to  vanish, leaving a coldness that  numbed him. \u201cI\u2019d rather know the whole  truth,\u201d he said. His voice sounded  dead in his ears. \u201cThe worst first.  The rejuvenation...?\u201d Cobb sighed and yet seemed relieved.  \u201cFailed.\u201d He stopped, and  his hands touched the reports on  his desk. \u201cCompletely,\u201d he added  in a low, defeated tone. \u201cBut I thought that was impossible!\u201d \u201cSo did I. I wouldn\u2019t believe  it even yet\u2014but now I find it  isn\u2019t the first case. I spent the  night at Medical Center going up  the ranks until I found men who  really know about it. And now I  wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d His voice ran  down and he gathered himself together  by an effort. \u201cIt\u2019s a shock  to me, too, Mr. Giles. But\u2014well,  to simplify it, no memory is perfect\u2014even  cellular memory. It  loses a little each time. And the  effect is cumulative. It\u2019s like an  asymptotic curve\u2014the further it  goes, the steeper the curve. And\u2014well,  you\u2019ve passed too far.\u201d He faced away from Giles,  dropping the reports into a  drawer and locking it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t  supposed to tell you, of course.  It\u2019s going to be tough enough  when they\u2019re ready to let people  know. But you aren\u2019t the first and  you won\u2019t be the last, if that\u2019s any  consolation. We\u2019ve got a longer  time scale than we used to have\u2014but  it\u2019s in centuries, not in  eons. For everybody, not just  you.\u201d It was no consolation. Giles  nodded mechanically. \u201cI won\u2019t  talk, of course. How\u2014how long?\u201d Cobb spread his hands unhappily.  \u201cThirty years, maybe. But  we can make them better. Geriatric  knowledge is still on record.  We can fix the heart and all the  rest. You\u2019ll be in good physical  condition, better than your grandfather\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd then....\u201d Giles couldn\u2019t  pronounce the words. He\u2019d grown  old and he\u2019d grow older. And  eventually he\u2019d die! An immortal man had suddenly  found death hovering on his  trail. The years had dwindled and  gone, and only a few were left. He stood up, holding out his  hand. \u201cThank you, Doctor,\u201d he  said, and was surprised to find  he meant it. The man had done  all he could and had at least  saved him the suspense of growing  doubt and horrible eventual  discovery. OUTSIDE ON the street, he  looked up at the Sun and  then at the buildings built to last  for thousands of years. Their  eternity was no longer a part of  him. Even his car would outlast him. He climbed into it, still partly  numbed, and began driving mechanically,  no longer wondering  about the dangers that might possibly  arise. Those wouldn\u2019t matter  much now. For a man who  had thought of living almost forever,  thirty years was too short  a time to count. He was passing near the club  and started to slow. Then he  went on without stopping. He  wanted no chance to have them  asking questions he couldn\u2019t answer.  It was none of their business.  Dubbins had been kind\u2014but  now Giles wanted no kindness. The street led to the office  and he drove on. What else was  there for him? There, at least, he  could still fill his time with work\u2014work  that might even be useful.  In the future, men would  need the super-light drive if they  were to span much more of the  Universe than now. And he could  speed up the work in some ways  still, even if he could never see  its finish. It would be cold comfort but it  was something. And he might  keep busy enough to forget sometimes  that the years were gone  for him. Automatic habit carried him  through the office again, to Amanda\u2019s  desk, where her worry was  still riding her. He managed a  grin and somehow the right words  came to his lips. \u201cI saw the doctor,  Amanda, so you can stop  figuring ways to get me there.\u201d She smiled back suddenly, without  feigning it. \u201cThen you\u2019re all  right?\u201d \u201cAs all right as I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d  he told her. \u201cThey tell me I\u2019m just  growing old.\u201d This time her laugh was heartier.  He caught himself before he  could echo her mirth in a different  voice and went inside where she  had the coffee waiting for him. Oddly, it still tasted good to  him. The projection was off, he saw,  wondering whether he\u2019d left it on  or not. He snapped the switch and  saw the screen light up, with the  people still in the odd, wheelless  vehicle on the alien planet. FOR A long moment, he stared  at the picture without thinking,  and then bent closer. Harry\u2019s  face hadn\u2019t changed much. Giles  had almost forgotten it, but there  was still the same grin there. And  his grandchildren had a touch  of it, too. And of their grandfather\u2019s  nose, he thought. Funny,  he\u2019d never seen even pictures of  his other grandchildren. Family  ties melted away too fast for interstellar  travel. Yet there seemed to be no  slackening of them in Harry\u2019s  case, and somehow it looked like  a family, rather than a mere  group. A very pleasant family in  a very pleasant world. He read Harry\u2019s note again,  with its praise for the planet and  its invitation. He wondered if  Dr. Vincenti had received an invitation  like that, before he left.  Or had he even been one of those  to whom the same report had  been delivered by some doctor?  It didn\u2019t matter, but it would explain  things, at least. Twenty years to Centaurus,  while the years dwindled down\u2014 Then abruptly the line finished  itself. \u201cThe years dwindle down  to a precious few....\u201d he remembered.  \u201cA precious few.\u201d Those dwindling years had  been precious once. He unexpectedly  recalled his own grandfather  holding him on an old  knee and slipping him candy  that was forbidden. The years  seemed precious to the old man  then. Amanda\u2019s voice came abruptly  over the intercom. \u201cJordan wants  to talk to you,\u201d she said, and the  irritation was sharp in her voice.  \u201cHe won\u2019t take no!\u201d Giles shrugged and reached for  the projector, to cut it off. Then,  on impulse, he set it back to the  picture, studying the group again  as he switched on Jordan\u2019s wire. But he didn\u2019t wait for the hot  words about whatever was the  trouble. \u201cBill,\u201d he said, \u201cstart getting  the big ship into production. I\u2019ve  found a volunteer.\u201d He\u2019d been driven to it, he knew,  as he watched the man\u2019s amazed  face snap from the screen. From  the first suspicion of his trouble,  something inside him had been  forcing him to make this decision.  And maybe it would do no good.  Maybe the ship would fail. But  thirty years was a number a man  could risk. If he made it, though.... Well, he\u2019d see those grandchildren  of his this year\u2014and  Harry. Maybe he\u2019d even tell  Harry the truth, once they got  done celebrating the reunion. And  there\u2019d be other grandchildren.  With the ship, he\u2019d have time  enough to look them up. Plenty  of time! Thirty years was a long time,  when he stopped to think of it. \u2014LESTER DEL REY \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does Giles change with the knowledge of his aging? \n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He shows a much greater appreciation for every aspect of his life. \".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels a new fondness for his son and family.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He feels a new fondness for his son and family.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He feels a new fondness for his son and family.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
