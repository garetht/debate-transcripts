      "background_text": "Just another free soul\nIn his foreword to the book, Lessig writes that you understand your subjects \u201cby learning to see them in a certain way.\u201d What is that certain way?\nI think I\u2019m trying to get a mental image of a person, certain\n expressions, or what I think that person is about. I\u2019m trying to capture\n what I think they look like, which is many times a minority of their\n typical expressions, or their typical stance. So, if I\u2019m taking pictures\n of Larry [Lessig], I want to have his signature hand gestures, and not\n just random ones.\nI think I\u2019m trying to capture pictures of people that help others see\n what they\u2019re about. Some photographers will make someone look the way\n the photographer wants them to look, and not the way they appear, so\n they\u2019ll pick the one picture out of 100 where the guy looks more\n egotistical than he really is. Some photographers are almost medical,\n and are going after a perfect portrait. I\u2019m somewhere in between.\nIt\u2019s amazing how many people will upload snapshots of people where the\n pictures don\u2019t look like them at all. To me, uploading a picture that is\n not an easily recognizable picture of that person defeats the point,\n which I\u2019m working toward, to try to express who they are. On the other\n hand, professional photographers usually have a subject whom they don\u2019t\n know personally, so they end up having to try to capture an image that\n they\u2019ve created based on who they think the person is or how they want\n that person to appear. You know how sculptors often say that they\u2019re\n just freeing an image from a block? What I\u2019m trying to do is free\n someone\u2019s soul from his or her image. There are a lot of things that\n make this hard. A lot of people are uncomfortable in front of a camera,\n or might make expressions that aren\u2019t very natural for them. And if the\n person is nervous, it\u2019s very difficult to try to see what it is that\n you\u2019re trying to capture.\nA lot of what I\u2019m doing is, I just start shooting photos. After half an\n hour of having their picture taken, people start to ignore you. Or I\u2019ll\n take pictures when I\u2019m talking to people about what they\u2019re doing, so\n after a while they get distracted by the conversation and forget about\n the camera. That\u2019s something that I\u2019m not perfect at, but I\u2019m getting\n better.\nI think good photographers are also able to disarm people through\n conversation, but still, it\u2019s difficult to have a disarming conversation\n with somebody you don\u2019t know, or to make them laugh. Many times people\n make a face for me that they wouldn\u2019t make for a professional\n photographer.\nFor instance, a board meeting picture, like the one with Eric Saltzman:\n that was during a very tense discussion. I\u2019ve found that people are at\n their most animated at these kinds of meetings, and look the most alive\n when they are under a lot of pressure, and super- focused. But usually\n if an outsider is in the room, they won\u2019t get into that. I mean, it\n would be difficult for a cameraman to be in a room where a board is\n having a heated debate.\nBut those are the things that I\u2019m trying to capture, because most people\n don\u2019t get to see that. At the Creative Commons board meeting, Larry\n asked me to put the camera away after awhile [laughs] because it was\n distracting. We were having a very heated discussion and I was taking\n all of these pictures. But he credited me later because afterward those\n pictures turned out the best.\nIn your mind, what is a \u2018Freesoul\u2019 ?\nA freesoul is somewhat of a pun. On the one hand it means you are free,\n liberated. You, as a human spirit, are open. And then, it also has the\n meaning that you are unencumbered legally, that you are free, as in\n \u2018free software.\u2019\nThere\u2019s a paradox: with many people\u2019s Wikipedia\n articles to which I\u2019ve contributed, when it comes to the picture, many\n of these people don\u2019t have any free photos of themselves on the web, so\n while they are \u201cnotable\u201d on Wikipedia, their images aren\u2019t free of the\n copyright of the photographer, or the institution who hired the\n photographer to take the picture. Often, even the subject of the article\n can\u2019t make an image available to the Wikimedia/Wikipedia community.\nThis means that a lot of people who have a Net presence have a legally\n encumbered Net presence. People who are invited to conferences get asked\n all the time, \u201cBy the way, do you have a photo that we can use?\u201d But\n they don\u2019t. By making these pictures available under a Creative Commons\n license, now they do. This is solving the issue of legal freedom.\nThe third part of the pun is that, since I\u2019m asking for a model release\n from the subjects, I\u2019m asking everyone to be much more open and giving\n about their image than most people typically are. I\u2019m giving, you\u2019re\n giving, we\u2019re all giving to participate and to try to create this\n wonderful work, and allow others to create derivative works.\nOf course people can abuse that, just like they can abuse anything. But\n I want people to see the value in sharing over the fear in sharing. The\n fact is, it\u2019s much more likely that somebody is going to use these\n pictures for something positive, rather than for something negative. The\n benefits greatly outweigh the risks. I think we spend way too much of\n our lives worrying about the risks, at the cost of a lot of the\n benefits.\nThis is a celebration of all of the people who are willing to give. In a\n way, giving up your image and allowing anyone to use it: it\u2019s the\n ultimate gift. In one way it\u2019s kind of vain. [laughs] But in another\n way it\u2019s wonderful. A Wikipedia article on some person but with no\n picture is sad.\nBesides Wikipedia, how do you imagine these photos being used?\nThey can be used in textbooks and in mainstream media articles about the\n person. Now they can get a picture that represents the person, at least\n from my perspective. That said, I shouldn\u2019t be the only person doing\n this. More people should do the same, and make the photographs available\n freely. For one, I feel that \u201cfree\u201d CC licensed photos have a much\n higher chance of not disappearing. But I don\u2019t know exactly how these\n photos are going to be used, so in a sense I\u2019m curious. For example,\n recently I received the Harvard Berkman Center pamphlet. It was a report\n of what they\u2019re doing, and they also had a bunch of my pictures in\n there. They all had attribution, and it made me feel really good. There\n were pictures of different Berkman Center members that I had taken in\n various places all over the world. I think that the subject is probably\n happy with this, and I\u2019m happy, and the Berkman Center\u2019s happy because\n they\u2019re not all pictures of people sitting at desks in the Berkman\n Center. There\u2019s one more important thing: Creative Commons is great for\n original creative works or derivative creative works, but when it\n involves human images, it gets very complicated. We all know the Virgin\n Mobile case, where Virgin used CC licensed images in an advertisement\n without getting permission from the models, and got in trouble. What\n we\u2019re trying to do here is to expand beyond just copyright, to make it\n more thorough from a legal perspective. It\u2019s also an important\n educational point, so people understand that, in addition to the\n Creative Commons licenses, we need people to provide other rights in\n cases where the law requires such rights to be cleared before reuse.\nWhat have you learned about the people in these networks, just in the past year?\nThat\u2019s a good question. I think that at least Creative Commons has\n become much more mainstream. Creative Commons has moved from a fringy\n academic discussion to a boardroom discussion. Yahoo announced that it\n will be using Creative Commons for all of their basic infrastructure,\n and integrating it all. Google has CC search in their advanced search.\nMicrosoft is working with CC as well and have a plug-in. Nine Inch Nails\n released their album, Ghost, under a Creative Commons license. The list\n goes on. Many people are asking: can you make money and share? The\n answer is, yes. CC is becoming an important part of the business\n discussion.\nBut one thing that happens when a movement like CC becomes a business\n thing, is that a lot of the pioneers fade into the background, and it\n becomes a part of industry. This happened to the Internet. And so while\n you still have the core people who still remember and hold the torch for\n the philosophical side, the Internet has become much more of a business.\n Now, when you go to many Internet conferences, it\u2019s mostly salesmen in\n attendance.\nI believe that the success of the Internet has two parts. The first part\n is the market- driven business side, which has made the Internet\n affordable and ubiquitous. The second part is the strong movement of\n participants who fight to keep the Internet open and try to prevent the\n business side from corrupting the fundamental elements that make the\n Internet great. The Net Neutrality or Open Network discussion going on\n right now is a good example of the importance of continuing to balance\n these principles with business interests.\nSimilarly, I think that business interests can help make Creative\n Commons ubiquitous and more easily accessible to everyone. However, I\n think it\u2019s important to remember to keep pushing to make content more\n \u201cfree\u201d and not allow businesses to use Creative Commons in exploitive or\n destructive ways.\nIn addition to the business side, Creative Commons is being used by\n educators to create open courseware around the world and in the area of\n science and technology to promote sharing in research. And as of now, we\n have the license ported to at least 44 jurisdictions, and the number of\n countries with projects continues to grow. In many ways, the movement\n outside of the United States has become much bigger than the movement in\n the United States. Although the United States is still slightly farther\n ahead in terms of commercialization, the size of the whole free culture\n movement outside of the United States is huge now. The CC China Photo\n exhibit was just amazing. There were some great\n images, and a lot of the photographers were professionals. This is\n beyond what anybody has done in the US. A lot of the progress that we\u2019re\n making is international.\nWhat are your personal realizations or experiences?\nWell, we\u2019re all getting old, if you look at these pictures. But there\u2019s\n another thing, though, about this book: the number of\n professional-quality amateurs has increased significantly due to the\n importance of digital in both professional and high-end amateur\n photography I hate to say it, a lot of people love the darkroom, but it\n really feels like the death of the darkroom with this year.\nWith new 22 megapixel cameras coming in under $10,000, and Lightroom\n and some of this software at a couple hundred dollars, it doesn\u2019t really\n make sense, except for particularly fussy artists, to do wet-work\n anymore. If you\u2019re a commercial photographer or a high-end amateur, you\n can do anything you used to do in the darkroom. I think it has really\n lowered the bar. I don\u2019t know how that affects the industry directly,\n but for me, it bridged a huge gap.\nI used to be darkroom geek. I loved my darkroom, and even when I didn\u2019t\n have my darkroom anymore, I still was shooting 6x6 Hasselblad 120 film\n and processing it in a special lab, and then digitizing it. For me, that\n film was it. You could never get as good as medium-format film or\n large-format film\nAt the time, the digital Hasselblad backs were too expensive, and were\n still not as good as 8x10 film. So there was this whole period where the\n darkroom was not all that exciting, but the digital wasn\u2019t perfect. I\n went through a limbo period. I had invested so much in my Hasselblad\n system, and my Leica M6 set. I had bought the Leica R8, but I was\n kicking myself because it was terrible. But then the Leica M8 came out,\n and I bought one at the beginning of 2007. The M8 really got me to where\n I could use my old gear, and it had enough megapixels to be as good as\n some film.\nAnother way of saying it was that there was a gear breakthrough at the\n beginning of last year. Okay, that\u2019s pretty materialistic! So there was\n a technology breakthrough, let\u2019s call it that, that allowed me to switch\n completely away from film, and I think this happened to a lot of\n photographers. It caused an explosion of content and an increase in the\n quality of content on sites like Flickr. It has\n allowed amateurs to create a business model with professionals.\n Interestingly, I think these new high-end amateurs are buying more\n photography books and photographs and are probably providing an\n increasing revenue stream for professional photographers. I think most\n amateurs, including myself, are paying homage to the professionals and\n not trying to \u201ccompete\u201d with them.\nDespite the existence of social software, what is still important about meeting people face-to-face?\nFor me, the right way to use a lot of the new social software is by\n making it easier to spend more physical time with the people you like\n best. Dopplr is a great example. When\n I visit a city, I will see all of the people who are in the city at the\n same time. When I went to London awhile ago, there were 47 people I knew\n in London, and a huge percentage of those people don\u2019t live there. I\n would bet that more than half of the photos in this book are pictures of\n friends, and they\u2019re not in their hometown.\nThat\u2019s the really interesting thing that is happening right now: it\u2019s\n really increasing your ability to spend quality time with, actually, a\n smaller number of people. It allows you to actively filter. Your\n meetings don\u2019t have to be random. If I look at the list of people in\n this book, although there are some obvious people missing whom I didn\u2019t\n see last year, probably met more of my friends last year, my real\n friends, than I\u2019ve met in any other year. I know my travels were crazy,\n but I think that the online world has allowed me to do that.\nWhat\u2019s great about photography is that it captures the moment that I was\n sharing with that person. It\u2019s not just a connection on a social network\n online, which is really pretty binary. I can look at all these photos\n and remember exactly what we were doing, what we were eating, what we\n were drinking, what we were talking about, and to me that\u2019s a much more\n rich experience.\nIt\u2019s the combination of social software and photography. For me, reality\n is \u201cthe present\u201d plus what you remember from the past. I think this\n project is really sharing memories with people. Blog posts contribute as\n well, but to me photography is a really good way of doing that. When I\n look at the expressions, I remember the moment and get a sense of\n presence.\nI think the main problem for me is the environmental impact of flying\n around. Just as I never believed that we would have a paperless office,\n being able to connect with people through social software mostly\n increases your travel, it doesn\u2019t decrease it. It is great because you\n get to meet all these people. But it is bad for the environment, and bad\n for our jet lag.\nHow would you characterize your contributions to free culture?\nI think it\u2019s mostly incremental. I think there is very little we\n actually do all by ourselves, and I hate saying, \u201cI did this\u201d or \u201cI did\n that.\u201d I think that in most cases, focusing on individual contributions\n or achievements undervalues the importance of everyone else involved.\nHaving said that, I think my main contribution is probably in supporting\n Creative Commons as a fan, board member, chairman of the board and now\n CEO. I think CC has a significant role, and helping to keep it on track\n and growing is probably the single most important role that I have in\n Free Culture.\nSpecifically, I think that trying to keep an international focus and a\n balance between business and the non-business elements of the movement\n is essential. My job is to keep that focus and maintain that balance.\n Also, CC needs to run smoothly as an organization and there is a lot of\n operational work that we all need to do. My photography is a way for me\n to participate in a small measure on the creative side of the Free\n Culture movement, and helps me see things from that perspective as well.\nHowever, I believe in emergent democracy and the importance of trying to\n celebrate the community more than the heroes. Of course, I\u2019m a huge fan\n of Larry\u2019s and I have great respect for the leaders of our movement. But\n more than anything, I\u2019m thankful for and respectful of all of the\n participants who aren\u2019t so well known and who are essential to moving\n everything forward.\nPersonally, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ultimately meaningful to talk about one\n individual\u2019s personal contribution to any movement. The real meaning is\n in the whole movement. I\u2019m just one participant. Just another free soul.\n",

People who are invited to conferences get asked\n all the time, \u201cBy the way, do you have a photo that we can use?\u201d But\n they don\u2019t. By making these pictures available under a Creative Commons\n license, now they do. This is solving the issue of legal freedom.\nThe third part of the pun is that, since I\u2019m asking for a model release\n from the subjects, I\u2019m asking everyone to be much more open and giving\n about their image than most people typically are. I\u2019m giving, you\u2019re\n giving, we\u2019re all giving to participate and to try to create this\n wonderful work, and allow others to create derivative works.\nOf course people can abuse that, just like they can abuse anything. But\n I want people to see the value in sharing over the fear in sharing. The\n fact is, it\u2019s much more likely that somebody is going to use these\n pictures for something positive, rather than for something negative. The\n benefits greatly outweigh the risks. I think we spend way too much of\n our lives worrying about the risks, at the cost of a lot of the\n benefits.\nThis is a celebration of all of the people who are willing to give. In a\n way, giving up your image and allowing anyone to use it: it\u2019s the\n ultimate gift. In one way it\u2019s kind of vain. [laughs] But in another\n way it\u2019s wonderful. A Wikipedia article on some person but with no\n picture is sad.\nBesides Wikipedia, how do you imagine these photos being used?\nThey can be used in textbooks and in mainstream media articles about the\n person. Now they can get a picture that represents the person, at least\n from my perspective. That said, I shouldn\u2019t be the only person doing\n this. More people should do the same, and make the photographs available\n freely. For one, I feel that \u201cfree\u201d CC licensed photos have a much\n higher chance of not disappearing. But I don\u2019t know exactly how these\n photos are going to be used, so in a sense I\u2019m curious. For example,\n recently I received the Harvard Berkman Center pamphlet. It was a report\n of what they\u2019re doing, and they also had a bunch of my pictures in\n there. They all had attribution, and it made me feel really good. There\n were pictures of different Berkman Center members that I had taken in\n various places all over the world. I think that the subject is probably\n happy with this, and I\u2019m happy, and the Berkman Center\u2019s happy because\n they\u2019re not all pictures of people sitting at desks in the Berkman\n Center. There\u2019s one more important thing: Creative Commons is great for\n original creative works or derivative creative works, but when it\n involves human images, it gets very complicated. We all know the Virgin\n Mobile case, where Virgin used CC licensed images in an advertisement\n without getting permission from the models, and got in trouble. What\n we\u2019re trying to do here is to expand beyond just copyright, to make it\n more thorough from a legal perspective. It\u2019s also an important\n educational point, so people understand that, in addition to the\n Creative Commons licenses, we need people to provide other rights in\n cases where the law requires such rights to be cleared before reuse.\nWhat have you learned about the people in these networks, just in the past year?\nThat\u2019s a good question. I think that at least Creative Commons has\n become much more mainstream. Creative Commons has moved from a fringy\n academic discussion to a boardroom discussion. Yahoo announced that it\n will be using Creative Commons for all of their basic infrastructure,\n and integrating it all. Google has CC search in their advanced search.\nMicrosoft is working with CC as well and have a plug-in. Nine Inch Nails\n released their album, Ghost, under a Creative Commons license. The list\n goes on. Many people are asking: can you make money and share? The\n answer is, yes. CC is becoming an important part of the business\n discussion.\nBut one thing that happens when a movement like CC becomes a business\n thing, is that a lot of the pioneers fade into the background, and it\n becomes a part of industry. This happened to the Internet. And so while\n you still have the core people who still remember and hold the torch for\n the philosophical side, the Internet has become much more of a business.\n Now, when you go to many Internet conferences, it\u2019s mostly salesmen in\n attendance.\nI believe that the success of the Internet has two parts. The first part\n is the market- driven business side, which has made the Internet\n affordable and ubiquitous. The second part is the strong movement of\n participants who fight to keep the Internet open and try to prevent the\n business side from corrupting the fundamental elements that make the\n Internet great. The Net Neutrality or Open Network discussion going on\n right now is a good example of the importance of continuing to balance\n these principles with business interests.\nSimilarly, I think that business interests can help make Creative\n Commons ubiquitous and more easily accessible to everyone. However, I\n think it\u2019s important to remember to keep pushing to make content more\n \u201cfree\u201d and not allow businesses to use Creative Commons in exploitive or\n destructive ways.\nIn addition to the business side, Creative Commons is being used by\n educators to create open courseware around the world and in the area of\n science and technology to promote sharing in research. And as of now, we\n have the license ported to at least 44 jurisdictions, and the number of\n countries with projects continues to grow. In many ways, the movement\n outside of the United States has become much bigger than the movement in\n the United States. Although the United States is still slightly farther\n ahead in terms of commercialization, the size of the whole free culture\n movement outside of the United States is huge now. The CC China Photo\n exhibit was just amazing. There were some great\n images, and a lot of the photographers were professionals. This is\n beyond what anybody has done in the US. A lot of the progress that we\u2019re\n making is international.\nWhat are your personal realizations or experiences?\nWell, we\u2019re all getting old, if you look at these pictures. But there\u2019s\n another thing, though, about this book: the number of\n professional-quality amateurs has increased significantly due to the\n importance of digital in both professional and high-end amateur\n photography I hate to say it, a lot of people love the darkroom, but it\n really feels like the death of the darkroom with this year.\nWith new 22 megapixel cameras coming in under $10,000, and Lightroom\n and some of this software at a couple hundred dollars, it doesn\u2019t really\n make sense, except for particularly fussy artists, to do wet-work\n anymore. If you\u2019re a commercial photographer or a high-end amateur, you\n can do anything you used to do in the darkroom. I think it has really\n lowered the bar. I don\u2019t know how that affects the industry directly,\n but for me, it bridged a huge gap.\nI used to be darkroom geek. I loved my darkroom, and even when I didn\u2019t\n have my darkroom anymore, I still was shooting 6x6 Hasselblad 120 film\n and processing it in a special lab, and then digitizing it. For me, that\n film was it. You could never get as good as medium-format film or\n large-format film\nAt the time, the digital Hasselblad backs were too expensive, and were\n still not as good as 8x10 film. So there was this whole period where the\n darkroom was not all that exciting, but the digital wasn\u2019t perfect. I\n went through a limbo period. I had invested so much in my Hasselblad\n system, and my Leica M6 set. I had bought the Leica R8, but I was\n kicking myself because it was terrible. But then the Leica M8 came out,\n and I bought one at the beginning of 2007. The M8 really got me to where\n I could use my old gear, and it had enough megapixels to be as good as\n some film.\nAnother way of saying it was that there was a gear breakthrough at the\n beginning of last year. Okay, that\u2019s pretty materialistic! So there was\n a technology breakthrough, let\u2019s call it that, that allowed me to switch\n completely away from film, and I think this happened to a lot of\n photographers. It caused an explosion of content and an increase in the\n quality of content on sites like Flickr. It has\n allowed amateurs to create a business model with professionals.\n Interestingly, I think these new high-end amateurs are buying more\n photography books and photographs and are probably providing an\n increasing revenue stream for professional photographers. I think most\n amateurs, including myself, are paying homage to the professionals and\n not trying to \u201ccompete\u201d with them.\nDespite the existence of social software, what is still important about meeting people face-to-face?\nFor me, the right way to use a lot of the new social software is by\n making it easier to spend more physical time with the people you like\n best. Dopplr is a great example. When\n I visit a city, I will see all of the people who are in the city at the\n same time. When I went to London awhile ago, there were 47 people I knew\n in London, and a huge percentage of those people don\u2019t live there. I\n would bet that more than half of the photos in this book are pictures of\n friends, and they\u2019re not in their hometown.\nThat\u2019s the really interesting thing that is happening right now: it\u2019s\n really increasing your ability to spend quality time with, actually, a\n smaller number of people. It allows you to actively filter. Your\n meetings don\u2019t have to be random. If I look at the list of people in\n this book, although there are some obvious people missing whom I didn\u2019t\n see last year, probably met more of my friends last year, my real\n friends, than I\u2019ve met in any other year. I know my travels were crazy,\n but I think that the online world has allowed me to do that.\nWhat\u2019s great about photography is that it captures the moment that I was\n sharing with that person. It\u2019s not just a connection on a social network\n online, which is really pretty binary. I can look at all these photos\n and remember exactly what we were doing, what we were eating, what we\n were drinking, what we were talking about, and to me that\u2019s a much more\n rich experience.\nIt\u2019s the combination of social software and photography. For me, reality\n is \u201cthe present\u201d plus what you remember from the past. I think this\n project is really sharing memories with people. Blog posts contribute as\n well, but to me photography is a really good way of doing that. When I\n look at the expressions, I remember the moment and get a sense of\n presence.\nI think the main problem for me is the environmental impact of flying\n around. Just as I never believed that we would have a paperless office,\n being able to connect with people through social software mostly\n increases your travel, it doesn\u2019t decrease it. It is great because you\n get to meet all these people. But it is bad for the environment, and bad\n for our jet lag.\nHow would you characterize your contributions to free culture?\nI think it\u2019s mostly incremental. I think there is very little we\n actually do all by ourselves, and I hate saying, \u201cI did this\u201d or \u201cI did\n that.\u201d I think that in most cases, focusing on individual contributions\n or achievements undervalues the importance of everyone else involved.\nHaving said that, I think my main contribution is probably in supporting\n Creative Commons as a fan, board member, chairman of the board and now\n CEO. I think CC has a significant role, and helping to keep it on track\n and growing is probably the single most important role that I have in\n Free Culture.\nSpecifically, I think that trying to keep an international focus and a\n balance between business and the non-business elements of the movement\n is essential. My job is to keep that focus and maintain that balance.\n Also, CC needs to run smoothly as an organization and there is a lot of\n operational work that we all need to do. My photography is a way for me\n to participate in a small measure on the creative side of the Free\n Culture movement, and helps me see things from that perspective as well.\nHowever, I believe in emergent democracy and the importance of trying to\n celebrate the community more than the heroes. Of course, I\u2019m a huge fan\n of Larry\u2019s and I have great respect for the leaders of our movement. But\n more than anything, I\u2019m thankful for and respectful of all of the\n participants who aren\u2019t so well known and who are essential to moving\n everything forward.\nPersonally, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ultimately meaningful to talk about one\n individual\u2019s personal contribution to any movement. The real meaning is\n in the whole movement. I\u2019m just one participant. Just another free soul.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author mean to communicate by comparing the photographer's task to the sculptor's mission?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Photographers should strive to capture the essence of a person, vs. how the photographer wishes to portray them\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Photographers should get to know their subjects on an intimate level, so the subjects feel more free to display their authentic selves during a session\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Photographers should get to know their subjects on an intimate level, so the subjects feel more free to display their authentic selves during a session\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Photographers should get to know their subjects on an intimate level, so the subjects feel more free to display their authentic selves during a session\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

I\u2019m trying to capture\n what I think they look like, which is many times a minority of their\n typical expressions, or their typical stance. So, if I\u2019m taking pictures\n of Larry [Lessig], I want to have his signature hand gestures, and not\n just random ones.\nI think I\u2019m trying to capture pictures of people that help others see\n what they\u2019re about. Some photographers will make someone look the way\n the photographer wants them to look, and not the way they appear, so\n they\u2019ll pick the one picture out of 100 where the guy looks more\n egotistical than he really is. Some photographers are almost medical,\n and are going after a perfect portrait. I\u2019m somewhere in between.\nIt\u2019s amazing how many people will upload snapshots of people where the\n pictures don\u2019t look like them at all. To me, uploading a picture that is\n not an easily recognizable picture of that person defeats the point,\n which I\u2019m working toward, to try to express who they are. On the other\n hand, professional photographers usually have a subject whom they don\u2019t\n know personally, so they end up having to try to capture an image that\n they\u2019ve created based on who they think the person is or how they want\n that person to appear. You know how sculptors often say that they\u2019re\n just freeing an image from a block? What I\u2019m trying to do is free\n someone\u2019s soul from his or her image. There are a lot of things that\n make this hard. A lot of people are uncomfortable in front of a camera,\n or might make expressions that aren\u2019t very natural for them. And if the\n person is nervous, it\u2019s very difficult to try to see what it is that\n you\u2019re trying to capture.\nA lot of what I\u2019m doing is, I just start shooting photos. After half an\n hour of having their picture taken, people start to ignore you. Or I\u2019ll\n take pictures when I\u2019m talking to people about what they\u2019re doing, so\n after a while they get distracted by the conversation and forget about\n the camera. That\u2019s something that I\u2019m not perfect at, but I\u2019m getting\n better.\nI think good photographers are also able to disarm people through\n conversation, but still, it\u2019s difficult to have a disarming conversation\n with somebody you don\u2019t know, or to make them laugh. Many times people\n make a face for me that they wouldn\u2019t make for a professional\n photographer.\nFor instance, a board meeting picture, like the one with Eric Saltzman:\n that was during a very tense discussion. I\u2019ve found that people are at\n their most animated at these kinds of meetings, and look the most alive\n when they are under a lot of pressure, and super- focused. But usually\n if an outsider is in the room, they won\u2019t get into that. I mean, it\n would be difficult for a cameraman to be in a room where a board is\n having a heated debate.\nBut those are the things that I\u2019m trying to capture, because most people\n don\u2019t get to see that. At the Creative Commons board meeting, Larry\n asked me to put the camera away after awhile [laughs] because it was\n distracting. We were having a very heated discussion and I was taking\n all of these pictures. But he credited me later because afterward those\n pictures turned out the best.\nIn your mind, what is a \u2018Freesoul\u2019 ?\nA freesoul is somewhat of a pun. On the one hand it means you are free,\n liberated. You, as a human spirit, are open. And then, it also has the\n meaning that you are unencumbered legally, that you are free, as in\n \u2018free software.\u2019\nThere\u2019s a paradox: with many people\u2019s Wikipedia\n articles to which I\u2019ve contributed, when it comes to the picture, many\n of these people don\u2019t have any free photos of themselves on the web, so\n while they are \u201cnotable\u201d on Wikipedia, their images aren\u2019t free of the\n copyright of the photographer, or the institution who hired the\n photographer to take the picture. Often, even the subject of the article\n can\u2019t make an image available to the Wikimedia/Wikipedia community.\nThis means that a lot of people who have a Net presence have a legally\n encumbered Net presence. People who are invited to conferences get asked\n all the time, \u201cBy the way, do you have a photo that we can use?\u201d But\n they don\u2019t. By making these pictures available under a Creative Commons\n license, now they do. This is solving the issue of legal freedom.\nThe third part of the pun is that, since I\u2019m asking for a model release\n from the subjects, I\u2019m asking everyone to be much more open and giving\n about their image than most people typically are. I\u2019m giving, you\u2019re\n giving, we\u2019re all giving to participate and to try to create this\n wonderful work, and allow others to create derivative works.\nOf course people can abuse that, just like they can abuse anything. But\n I want people to see the value in sharing over the fear in sharing. The\n fact is, it\u2019s much more likely that somebody is going to use these\n pictures for something positive, rather than for something negative. The\n benefits greatly outweigh the risks. I think we spend way too much of\n our lives worrying about the risks, at the cost of a lot of the\n benefits.\nThis is a celebration of all of the people who are willing to give.

I think most\n amateurs, including myself, are paying homage to the professionals and\n not trying to \u201ccompete\u201d with them.\nDespite the existence of social software, what is still important about meeting people face-to-face?\nFor me, the right way to use a lot of the new social software is by\n making it easier to spend more physical time with the people you like\n best. Dopplr is a great example. When\n I visit a city, I will see all of the people who are in the city at the\n same time. When I went to London awhile ago, there were 47 people I knew\n in London, and a huge percentage of those people don\u2019t live there. I\n would bet that more than half of the photos in this book are pictures of\n friends, and they\u2019re not in their hometown.\nThat\u2019s the really interesting thing that is happening right now: it\u2019s\n really increasing your ability to spend quality time with, actually, a\n smaller number of people. It allows you to actively filter. Your\n meetings don\u2019t have to be random. If I look at the list of people in\n this book, although there are some obvious people missing whom I didn\u2019t\n see last year, probably met more of my friends last year, my real\n friends, than I\u2019ve met in any other year. I know my travels were crazy,\n but I think that the online world has allowed me to do that.\nWhat\u2019s great about photography is that it captures the moment that I was\n sharing with that person. It\u2019s not just a connection on a social network\n online, which is really pretty binary. I can look at all these photos\n and remember exactly what we were doing, what we were eating, what we\n were drinking, what we were talking about, and to me that\u2019s a much more\n rich experience.\nIt\u2019s the combination of social software and photography. For me, reality\n is \u201cthe present\u201d plus what you remember from the past. I think this\n project is really sharing memories with people. Blog posts contribute as\n well, but to me photography is a really good way of doing that. When I\n look at the expressions, I remember the moment and get a sense of\n presence.\nI think the main problem for me is the environmental impact of flying\n around. Just as I never believed that we would have a paperless office,\n being able to connect with people through social software mostly\n increases your travel, it doesn\u2019t decrease it. It is great because you\n get to meet all these people. But it is bad for the environment, and bad\n for our jet lag.\nHow would you characterize your contributions to free culture?\nI think it\u2019s mostly incremental. I think there is very little we\n actually do all by ourselves, and I hate saying, \u201cI did this\u201d or \u201cI did\n that.\u201d I think that in most cases, focusing on individual contributions\n or achievements undervalues the importance of everyone else involved.\nHaving said that, I think my main contribution is probably in supporting\n Creative Commons as a fan, board member, chairman of the board and now\n CEO. I think CC has a significant role, and helping to keep it on track\n and growing is probably the single most important role that I have in\n Free Culture.\nSpecifically, I think that trying to keep an international focus and a\n balance between business and the non-business elements of the movement\n is essential. My job is to keep that focus and maintain that balance.\n Also, CC needs to run smoothly as an organization and there is a lot of\n operational work that we all need to do. My photography is a way for me\n to participate in a small measure on the creative side of the Free\n Culture movement, and helps me see things from that perspective as well.\nHowever, I believe in emergent democracy and the importance of trying to\n celebrate the community more than the heroes. Of course, I\u2019m a huge fan\n of Larry\u2019s and I have great respect for the leaders of our movement. But\n more than anything, I\u2019m thankful for and respectful of all of the\n participants who aren\u2019t so well known and who are essential to moving\n everything forward.\nPersonally, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ultimately meaningful to talk about one\n individual\u2019s personal contribution to any movement. The real meaning is\n in the whole movement. I\u2019m just one participant. Just another free soul.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author mean to communicate by comparing the photographer's task to the sculptor's mission?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Photographers should strive to capture the essence of a person, vs. how the photographer wishes to portray them\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Photographers should get to know their subjects on an intimate level, so the subjects feel more free to display their authentic selves during a session\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Photographers should get to know their subjects on an intimate level, so the subjects feel more free to display their authentic selves during a session\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Photographers should get to know their subjects on an intimate level, so the subjects feel more free to display their authentic selves during a session\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
