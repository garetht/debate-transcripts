      "background_text": "Fallout is, of course, always disastrous\u2014   one way or another JUNIOR ACHIEVEMENT BY WILLIAM LEE ILLUSTRATED BY SCHOENHERR \"What would you think,\" I asked  Marjorie over supper, \"if I should undertake  to lead a junior achievement  group this summer?\"\n\n\n She pondered it while she went to  the kitchen to bring in the dessert.  It was dried apricot pie, and very  tasty, I might add.\n\n\n \"Why, Donald,\" she said, \"it could  be quite interesting, if I understand  what a junior achievement group is.  What gave you the idea?\"\n\n\n \"It wasn't my idea, really,\" I admitted.  \"Mr. McCormack called me  to the office today, and told me that  some of the children in the lower  grades wanted to start one. They  need adult guidance of course, and  one of the group suggested my name.\"\n\n\n I should explain, perhaps, that I  teach a course in general science in  our Ridgeville Junior High School,  and another in general physics in the  Senior High School. It's a privilege  which I'm sure many educators must  envy, teaching in Ridgeville, for our  new school is a fine one, and our  academic standards are high. On the  other hand, the fathers of most of  my students work for the Commission  and a constant awareness of the Commission  and its work pervades the  town. It is an uneasy privilege then,  at least sometimes, to teach my old-fashioned  brand of science to these  children of a new age.\n\n\n \"That's very nice,\" said Marjorie.  \"What does a junior achievement  group do?\"\n\n\n \"It has the purpose,\" I told her,  \"of teaching the members something  about commerce and industry. They  manufacture simple compositions  like polishing waxes and sell them  from door-to-door. Some groups have  built up tidy little bank accounts  which are available for later educational  expenses.\"\n\n\n \"Gracious, you wouldn't have to  sell from door-to-door, would you?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not. I'd just tell the  kids how to do it.\"\n\n\n Marjorie put back her head and  laughed, and I was forced to join her,  for we both recognize that my understanding  and \"feel\" for commercial  matters\u2014if I may use that expression\u2014is  almost nonexistent.\n\n\n \"Oh, all right,\" I said, \"laugh at  my commercial aspirations. But don't  worry about it, really. Mr. McCormack  said we could get Mr. Wells from  Commercial Department to help out  if he was needed. There is one problem,  though. Mr. McCormack is going  to put up fifty dollars to buy any  raw materials wanted and he rather  suggested that I might advance another  fifty. The question is, could we  do it?\"\n\n\n Marjorie did mental arithmetic.  \"Yes,\" she said, \"yes, if it's something  you'd like to do.\"\n\n\n We've had to watch such things  rather closely for the last ten\u2014no,  eleven years. Back in the old Ridgeville,  fifty-odd miles to the south, we  had our home almost paid for, when  the accident occurred. It was in the  path of the heaviest fallout, and we  couldn't have kept on living there  even if the town had stayed. When  Ridgeville moved to its present site,  so, of course, did we, which meant  starting mortgage payments all over  again. Thus it was that on a Wednesday  morning about three weeks later, I  was sitting at one end of a plank picnic  table with five boys and girls  lined up along the sides. This was to  be our headquarters and factory for  the summer\u2014a roomy unused barn  belonging to the parents of one of  the group members, Tommy Miller.\n\n\n \"O.K.,\" I said, \"let's relax. You  don't need to treat me as a teacher,  you know. I stopped being a school  teacher when the final grades went in  last Friday. I'm on vacation now. My  job here is only to advise, and I'm  going to do that as little as possible.  You're going to decide what to do,  and if it's safe and legal and possible  to do with the starting capital we  have, I'll go along with it and help  in any way I can. This is your meeting.\"\n\n\n Mr. McCormack had told me, and  in some detail, about the youngsters  I'd be dealing with. The three who  were sitting to my left were the ones  who had proposed the group in the  first place.\n\n\n Doris Enright was a grave young  lady of ten years, who might, I  thought, be quite a beauty in a few  more years, but was at the moment  rather angular\u2014all shoulders and elbows.  Peter Cope, Jr. and Hilary Matlack  were skinny kids, too. The three  were of an age and were all tall for  ten-year-olds.\n\n\n I had the impression during that  first meeting that they looked rather  alike, but this wasn't so. Their features  were quite different. Perhaps  from association, for they were close  friends, they had just come to have  a certain similarity of restrained gesture  and of modulated voice. And  they were all tanned by sun and wind  to a degree that made their eyes seem  light and their teeth startlingly white.\n\n\n The two on my right were cast in  a different mold. Mary McCready  was a big husky redhead of twelve,  with a face full of freckles and an  infectious laugh, and Tommy Miller,  a few months younger, was just an  average, extroverted, well adjusted  youngster, noisy and restless, tee-shirted  and butch-barbered.\n\n\n The group exchanged looks to see  who would lead off, and Peter Cope  seemed to be elected.\n\n\n \"Well, Mr. Henderson, a junior  achievement group is a bunch of kids  who get together to manufacture and  sell things, and maybe make some  money.\"\n\n\n \"Is that what you want to do,\" I  asked, \"make money?\"\n\n\n \"Why not?\" Tommy asked.  \"There's something wrong with making  money?\"\n\n\n \"Well, sure, I suppose we want to,\"  said Hilary. \"We'll need some money  to do the things we want to do later.\"\n\n\n \"And what sort of things would  you like to make and sell?\" I asked.\n\n\n The usual products, of course, with  these junior achievement efforts, are  chemical specialties that can be made  safely and that people will buy and  use without misgivings\u2014solvent to  free up rusty bolts, cleaner to remove  road tar, mechanic's hand soap\u2014that  sort of thing. Mr. McCormack had  told me, though, that I might find  these youngsters a bit more ambitious.  \"The Miller boy and Mary McCready,\"  he had said, \"have exceptionally  high IQ's\u2014around one forty  or one fifty. The other three are hard  to classify. They have some of the  attributes of exceptional pupils, but  much of the time they seem to have  little interest in their studies. The  junior achievement idea has sparked  their imaginations. Maybe it'll be just  what they need.\"\n\n\n Mary said, \"Why don't we make a  freckle remover? I'd be our first customer.\" \"The thing to do,\" Tommy offered,  \"is to figure out what people in  Ridgeville want to buy, then sell it  to them.\"\n\n\n \"I'd like to make something by  powder metallurgy techniques,\" said  Pete. He fixed me with a challenging  eye. \"You should be able to make  ball bearings by molding, then densify  them by electroplating.\"\n\n\n \"And all we'd need is a hydraulic  press,\" I told him, \"which, on a guess,  might cost ten thousand dollars. Let's  think of something easier.\"\n\n\n Pete mulled it over and nodded  reluctantly. \"Then maybe something  in the electronics field. A hi-fi sub-assembly  of some kind.\"\n\n\n \"How about a new detergent?\" Hilary  put in.\n\n\n \"Like the liquid dishwashing detergents?\"  I asked.\n\n\n He was scornful. \"No, they're formulations\u2014you  know, mixtures.  That's cookbook chemistry. I mean a  brand new synthetic detergent. I've  got an idea for one that ought to be  good even in the hard water we've  got around here.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" I said, \"organic synthesis  sounds like another operation  calling for capital investment. If we  should keep the achievement group  going for several summers, it might  be possible later on to carry out a  safe synthesis of some sort. You're  Dr. Matlack's son, aren't you? Been  dipping into your father's library?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Hilary, \"and I've got  a home laboratory.\"\n\n\n \"How about you, Doris?\" I prompted.  \"Do you have a special field of interest?\"\n\n\n \"No.\" She shook her head in mock  despondency. \"I'm not very technical.  Just sort of miscellaneous. But if the  group wanted to raise some mice, I'd  be willing to turn over a project I've  had going at home.\"\n\n\n \"You could sell mice?\" Tommy demanded  incredulously.\n\n\n \"Mice,\" I echoed, then sat back and  thought about it. \"Are they a pure  strain? One of the recognized laboratory  strains? Healthy mice of the  right strain,\" I explained to Tommy,  \"might be sold to laboratories. I have  an idea the Commission buys a supply  every month.\"\n\n\n \"No,\" said Doris, \"these aren't laboratory  mice. They're fancy ones. I  got the first four pairs from a pet  shop in Denver, but they're red\u2014sort  of chipmunk color, you know. I've  carried them through seventeen generations  of careful selection.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" I admitted, \"the market  for red mice might be rather limited.  Why don't you consider making  an after-shave lotion? Denatured alcohol,  glycerine, water, a little color  and perfume. You could buy some  bottles and have some labels printed.  You'd be in business before you  knew it.\"\n\n\n There was a pause, then Tommy  inquired, \"How do you sell it?\"\n\n\n \"Door-to-door.\"\n\n\n He made a face. \"Never build up  any volume. Unless it did something  extra. You say we'd put color in it.  How about enough color to leave  your face looking tanned. Men won't  use cosmetics and junk, but if they  didn't have to admit it, they might  like the shave lotion.\"\n\n\n Hilary had been deep in thought.  He said suddenly, \"Gosh, I think I  know how to make a\u2014what do you  want to call it\u2014a before-shave lotion.\"\n\n\n \"What would that be?\" I asked.\n\n\n \"You'd use it before you shaved.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose there might be people  who'd prefer to use it beforehand,\"  I conceded.\n\n\n \"There will be people,\" he said  darkly, and subsided.\n\n\n Mrs. Miller came out to the barn  after a while, bringing a bucket of  soft drinks and ice, a couple of loaves  of bread and ingredients for a variety  of sandwiches. The parents had  agreed to underwrite lunches at the  barn and Betty Miller philosophically  assumed the role of commissary  officer. She paused only to say hello  and to ask how we were progressing  with our organization meeting.\n\n\n I'd forgotten all about organization,  and that, according to all the  articles I had perused, is most important  to such groups. It's standard practice  for every member of the group  to be a company officer. Of course a  young boy who doesn't know any better,  may wind up a sales manager.\n\n\n Over the sandwiches, then, I suggested  nominating company officers,  but they seemed not to be interested.  Peter Cope waved it off by remarking  that they'd each do what came  naturally. On the other hand, they  pondered at some length about a  name for the organization, without  reaching any conclusions, so we returned  to the problem of what to  make.\n\n\n It was Mary, finally, who advanced  the thought of kites. At first there  was little enthusiasm, then Peter said,  \"You know, we could work up something  new. Has anybody ever seen a  kite made like a wind sock?\"\n\n\n Nobody had. Pete drew figures in  the air with his hands. \"How about  the hole at the small end?\"\n\n\n \"I'll make one tonight,\" said Doris,  \"and think about the small end.  It'll work out all right.\"\n\n\n I wished that the youngsters weren't  starting out by inventing a new  article to manufacture, and risking an  almost certain disappointment, but to  hold my guidance to the minimum, I  said nothing, knowing that later I  could help them redesign it along  standard lines. At supper I reviewed the day's  happenings with Marjorie and tried  to recall all of the ideas which had  been propounded. Most of them were  impractical, of course, for a group of  children to attempt, but several of  them appeared quite attractive.\n\n\n Tommy, for example, wanted to  put tooth powder into tablets that  one would chew before brushing the  teeth. He thought there should be  two colors in the same bottle\u2014orange  for morning and blue for night,  the blue ones designed to leave the  mouth alkaline at bed time.\n\n\n Pete wanted to make a combination  nail and wood screw. You'd  drive it in with a hammer up to the  threaded part, then send it home with  a few turns of a screwdriver.\n\n\n Hilary, reluctantly forsaking his  ideas on detergents, suggested we  make black plastic discs, like poker  chips but thinner and as cheap as  possible, to scatter on a snowy sidewalk  where they would pick up extra  heat from the sun and melt the  snow more rapidly. Afterward one  would sweep up and collect the discs.\n\n\n Doris added to this that if you  could make the discs light enough to  float, they might be colored white  and spread on the surface of a reservoir  to reduce evaporation.\n\n\n These latter ideas had made unknowing  use of some basic physics,  and I'm afraid I relapsed for a few  minutes into the role of teacher and  told them a little bit about the laws  of radiation and absorption of heat.\n\n\n \"My,\" said Marjorie, \"they're really  smart boys and girls. Tommy Miller  does sound like a born salesman.  Somehow I don't think you're going  to have to call in Mr. Wells.\"\n\n\n I do feel just a little embarrassed  about the kite, even now. The fact  that it flew surprised me. That it flew  so confoundedly well was humiliating.  Four of them were at the barn  when I arrived next morning; or  rather on the rise of ground just beyond  it, and the kite hung motionless  and almost out of sight in the pale  sky. I stood and watched for a moment,  then they saw me.\n\n\n \"Hello, Mr. Henderson,\" Mary said,  and proffered the cord which was  wound on a fishing reel. I played the  kite up and down for a few minutes,  then reeled it in. It was, almost exactly,  a wind sock, but the hole at the  small end was shaped\u2014by wire\u2014into  the general form of a kidney bean.  It was beautifully made, and had a  sort of professional look about it.\n\n\n \"It flies too well,\" Mary told Doris.  \"A kite ought to get caught in a tree  sometimes.\"\n\n\n \"You're right,\" Doris agreed. \"Let's  see it.\" She gave the wire at the small  end the slightest of twists. \"There, it  ought to swoop.\"\n\n\n Sure enough, in the moderate  breeze of that morning, the kite  swooped and yawed to Mary's entire  satisfaction. As we trailed back to the  barn I asked Doris, \"How did you  know that flattening the lower edge  of the hole would create instability?\"  She looked doubtful.\n\n\n \"Why it would have to, wouldn't  it? It changed the pattern of air pressures.\"  She glanced at me quickly.  \"Of course, I tried a lot of different  shapes while I was making it.\"\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" I said, and let it go at  that. \"Where's Tommy?\"\n\n\n \"He stopped off at the bank,\" Pete  Cope told me, \"to borrow some money.  We'll want to buy materials to  make some of these kites.\"\n\n\n \"But I said yesterday that Mr. McCormack  and I were going to advance  some cash to get started.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, but don't you think it  would be better to borrow from a  bank? More businesslike?\"\n\n\n \"Doubtless,\" I said, \"but banks generally  want some security.\" I would  have gone on and explained matters  further, except that Tommy walked  in and handed me a pocket check  book.\n\n\n \"I got two hundred and fifty,\" he  volunteered\u2014not without a hint of  complacency in his voice. \"It didn't  take long, but they sure made it out  a big deal. Half the guys in the bank  had to be called in to listen to the  proposition. The account's in your  name, Mr. Henderson, and you'll have  to make out the checks. And they  want you to stop in at the bank and  give them a specimen signature. Oh,  yes, and cosign the note.\"\n\n\n My heart sank. I'd never had any  dealings with banks except in the  matter of mortgages, and bank people  make me most uneasy. To say  nothing of finding myself responsible  for a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar  note\u2014over two weeks salary. I made  a mental vow to sign very few checks.\n\n\n \"So then I stopped by at Apex  Stationers,\" Tommy went on, \"and ordered  some paper and envelopes. We  hadn't picked a name yesterday, but I  figured what's to lose, and picked one.  Ridge Industries, how's that?\" Everybody  nodded.\n\n\n \"Just three lines on the letterhead,\"  he explained. \"Ridge Industries\u2014Ridgeville\u2014Montana.\"\n\n\n I got my voice back and said, \"Engraved,  I trust.\"\n\n\n \"Well, sure,\" he replied. \"You can't  afford to look chintzy.\" My appetite was not at its best  that evening, and Marjorie recognized  that something was concerning  me, but she asked no questions, and  I only told her about the success of  the kite, and the youngsters embarking  on a shopping trip for paper, glue  and wood splints. There was no use  in both of us worrying.\n\n\n On Friday we all got down to work,  and presently had a regular production  line under way; stapling the  wood splints, then wetting them with  a resin solution and shaping them  over a mandrel to stiffen, cutting the  plastic film around a pattern, assembling  and hanging the finished kites  from an overhead beam until the cement  had set. Pete Cope had located  a big roll of red plastic film from  somewhere, and it made a wonderful-looking  kite. Happily, I didn't know  what the film cost until the first kites  were sold.\n\n\n By Wednesday of the following  week we had almost three hundred  kites finished and packed into flat  cardboard boxes, and frankly I didn't  care if I never saw another. Tommy,  who by mutual consent, was our  authority on sales, didn't want to sell  any until we had, as he put it, enough  to meet the demand, but this quantity  seemed to satisfy him. He said he  would sell them the next week and  Mary McCready, with a fine burst of  confidence, asked him in all seriousness  to be sure to hold out a dozen.\n\n\n Three other things occurred that  day, two of which I knew about immediately.  Mary brought a portable  typewriter from home and spent part  of the afternoon banging away at  what seemed to me, since I use two  fingers only, a very creditable speed.\n\n\n And Hilary brought in a bottle of  his new detergent. It was a syrupy  yellow liquid with a nice collar of  suds. He'd been busy in his home  laboratory after all, it seemed.\n\n\n \"What is it?\" I asked. \"You never  told us.\"\n\n\n Hilary grinned. \"Lauryl benzyl  phosphonic acid, dipotassium salt, in  20% solution.\"\n\n\n \"Goodness.\" I protested, \"it's been  twenty-five years since my last course  in chemistry. Perhaps if I saw the  formula\u2014.\"\n\n\n He gave me a singularly adult  smile and jotted down a scrawl of  symbols and lines. It meant little to  me.\n\n\n \"Is it good?\"\n\n\n For answer he seized the ice bucket,  now empty of its soda bottles,  trickled in a few drops from the bottle  and swished the contents. Foam  mounted to the rim and spilled over.  \"And that's our best grade of Ridgeville  water,\" he pointed out. \"Hardest  in the country.\"\n\n\n The third event of Wednesday  came to my ears on Thursday morning.\n\n\n I was a little late arriving at the  barn, and was taken a bit aback to  find the roadway leading to it rather  full of parked automobiles, and the  barn itself rather full of people, including  two policemen. Our Ridgeville  police are quite young men, but  in uniform they still look ominous  and I was relieved to see that they  were laughing and evidently enjoying  themselves.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" I demanded, in my  best classroom voice. \"What is all  this?\"\n\n\n \"Are you Henderson?\" the larger  policeman asked.\n\n\n \"I am indeed,\" I said, and a flash  bulb went off. A young lady grasped  my arm.\n\n\n \"Oh, please, Mr. Henderson, come  outside where it's quieter and tell me  all about it.\"\n\n\n \"Perhaps,\" I countered, \"somebody  should tell me.\"\n\n\n \"You mean you don't know, honestly?  Oh, it's fabulous. Best story I've  had for ages. It'll make the city papers.\"  She led me around the corner  of the barn to a spot of comparative  quiet.\n\n\n \"You didn't know that one of your  junior whatsisnames poured detergent  in the Memorial Fountain basin  last night?\"\n\n\n I shook my head numbly.\n\n\n \"It was priceless. Just before rush  hour. Suds built up in the basin and  overflowed, and down the library  steps and covered the whole street.  And the funniest part was they kept  right on coming. You couldn't imagine  so much suds coming from that  little pool of water. There was a  three-block traffic jam and Harry got  us some marvelous pictures\u2014men  rolling up their trousers to wade  across the street. And this morning,\"  she chortled, \"somebody phoned in  an anonymous tip to the police\u2014of  course it was the same boy that did  it\u2014Tommy\u2014Miller?\u2014and so here  we are. And we just saw a demonstration  of that fabulous kite and saw  all those simply captivating mice.\"\n\n\n \"Mice?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course. Who would ever  have thought you could breed mice  with those cute furry tails?\" Well, after a while things quieted  down. They had to. The police left  after sobering up long enough to  give me a serious warning against  letting such a thing happen again.  Mr. Miller, who had come home to  see what all the excitement was, went  back to work and Mrs. Miller went  back to the house and the reporter  and photographer drifted off to file  their story, or whatever it is they do.  Tommy was jubilant.\n\n\n \"Did you hear what she said? It'll  make the city papers. I wish we had  a thousand kites. Ten thousand. Oh  boy, selling is fun. Hilary, when can  you make some more of that stuff?  And Doris, how many mice do you  have?\"\n\n\n Those mice! I have always kept  my enthusiasm for rodents within  bounds, but I must admit they were  charming little beasts, with tails as  bushy as miniature squirrels.\n\n\n \"How many generations?\" I asked  Doris.\n\n\n \"Seventeen. No, eighteen, now.  Want to see the genetic charts?\"\n\n\n I won't try to explain it as she did  to me, but it was quite evident that  the new mice were breeding true.  Presently we asked Betty Miller to  come back down to the barn for a  conference. She listened and asked  questions. At last she said, \"Well, all  right, if you promise me they can't  get out of their cages. But heaven  knows what you'll do when fall  comes. They won't live in an unheated  barn and you can't bring them  into the house.\"\n\n\n \"We'll be out of the mouse business  by then,\" Doris predicted. \"Every pet  shop in the country will have  them and they'll be down to nothing  apiece.\"\n\n\n Doris was right, of course, in spite  of our efforts to protect the market.  Anyhow that ushered in our cage  building phase, and for the next  week\u2014with a few interruptions\u2014we  built cages, hundreds of them, a good  many for breeding, but mostly for  shipping.\n\n\n It was rather regrettable that, after  the Courier gave us most of the third  page, including photographs, we rarely  had a day without a few visitors.  Many of them wanted to buy mice or  kites, but Tommy refused to sell any  mice at retail and we soon had to disappoint  those who wanted kites. The  Supermarket took all we had\u2014except  a dozen\u2014and at a dollar fifty  each. Tommy's ideas of pricing rather  frightened me, but he set the value  of the mice at ten dollars a pair  and got it without any arguments.\n\n\n Our beautiful stationery arrived,  and we had some invoice forms printed  up in a hurry\u2014not engraved, for  a wonder.\n\n\n It was on Tuesday\u2014following the  Thursday\u2014that a lanky young man  disentangled himself from his car  and strolled into the barn. I looked  up from the floor where I was tacking  squares of screening onto wooden  frames.\n\n\n \"Hi,\" he said. \"You're Donald  Henderson, right? My name is McCord\u2014Jeff  McCord\u2014and I work in  the Patent Section at the Commission's  downtown office. My boss sent  me over here, but if he hadn't, I  think I'd have come anyway. What  are you doing to get patent protection  on Ridge Industries' new developments?\"\n\n\n I got my back unkinked and dusted  off my knees. \"Well, now,\" I said,  \"I've been wondering whether something  shouldn't be done, but I know  very little about such matters\u2014.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly,\" he broke in, \"we guessed  that might be the case, and there are  three patent men in our office who'd  like to chip in and contribute some  time. Partly for the kicks and partly  because we think you may have some  things worth protecting. How about  it? You worry about the filing and  final fees. That's sixty bucks per  brainstorm. We'll worry about everything  else.\"\n\n\n \"What's to lose,\" Tommy interjected.\n\n\n And so we acquired a patent attorney,  several of them, in fact.\n\n\n The day that our application on  the kite design went to Washington,  Mary wrote a dozen toy manufacturers  scattered from New York to Los  Angeles, sent a kite to each one and  offered to license the design. Result,  one licensee with a thousand dollar  advance against next season's royalties. It was a rainy morning about three  weeks later that I arrived at the barn.  Jeff McCord was there, and the whole  team except Tommy. Jeff lowered his  feet from the picnic table and said,  \"Hi.\"\n\n\n \"Hi yourself,\" I told him. \"You  look pleased.\"\n\n\n \"I am,\" he replied, \"in a cautious  legal sense, of course. Hilary and I  were just going over the situation on  his phosphonate detergent. I've spent  the last three nights studying the patent  literature and a few standard  texts touching on phosphonates.  There are a zillion patents on synthetic  detergents and a good round  fifty on phosphonates, but it looks\"\u2014he  held up a long admonitory hand\u2014\"it  just looks as though we had a clear  spot. If we do get protection, you've  got a real salable property.\"\n\n\n \"That's fine, Mr. McCord,\" Hilary  said, \"but it's not very important.\"\n\n\n \"No?\" Jeff tilted an inquiring eyebrow  at me, and I handed him a small  bottle. He opened and sniffed at it  gingerly. \"What gives?\"\n\n\n \"Before-shave lotion,\" Hilary told  him. \"You've shaved this morning,  but try some anyway.\"\n\n\n Jeff looked momentarily dubious,  then puddled some in his palm and  moistened his jaw line. \"Smells  good,\" he noted, \"and feels nice and  cool. Now what?\"\n\n\n \"Wipe your face.\" Jeff located a  handkerchief and wiped, looked at  the cloth, wiped again, and stared.\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"A whisker stiffener. It makes each  hair brittle enough to break off right  at the surface of your skin.\"\n\n\n \"So I perceive. What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, just a mixture of stuff. Cookbook  chemistry. Cysteine thiolactone  and a fat-soluble magnesium compound.\"\n\n\n \"I see. Just a mixture of stuff. And  do your whiskers grow back the next  day?\"\n\n\n \"Right on schedule,\" I said.\n\n\n McCord unfolded his length and  stood staring out into the rain. Presently  he said, \"Henderson, Hilary  and I are heading for my office. We  can work there better than here, and  if we're going to break the hearts of  the razor industry, there's no better  time to start than now.\"\n\n\n When they had driven off I turned  and said, \"Let's talk a while. We can  always clean mouse cages later.  Where's Tommy?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, he stopped at the bank to get  a loan.\"\n\n\n \"What on earth for? We have over  six thousand in the account.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Peter said, looking a little  embarrassed, \"we were planning to  buy a hydraulic press. You see, Doris  put some embroidery on that scheme  of mine for making ball bearings.\"  He grabbed a sheet of paper. \"Look,  we make a roller bearing, this shape  only it's a permanent magnet. Then  you see\u2014.\" And he was off.\n\n\n \"What did they do today, dear?\"  Marge asked as she refilled my coffee  cup.\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" I said. \"Let's see, it was  a big day. We picked out a hydraulic  press, Doris read us the first chapter  of the book she's starting, and we  found a place over a garage on  Fourth Street that we can rent for  winter quarters. Oh, yes, and Jeff is  starting action to get the company  incorporated.\"\n\n\n \"Winter quarters,\" Marge repeated.  \"You mean you're going to try to  keep the group going after school  starts?\"\n\n\n \"Why not? The kids can sail  through their courses without thinking  about them, and actually they  won't put in more than a few hours  a week during the school year.\"\n\n\n \"Even so, it's child labor, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Child labor nothing. They're the  employers. Jeff McCord and I will  be the only employees\u2014just at first,  anyway.\"\n\n\n Marge choked on something. \"Did  you say you'd be an employee?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told her. \"They've offered  me a small share of the company,  and I'd be crazy to turn it down. After  all, what's to lose?\" Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Analog Science Fact &amp; Fiction July 1962.

It was dried apricot pie, and very  tasty, I might add.\n\n\n \"Why, Donald,\" she said, \"it could  be quite interesting, if I understand  what a junior achievement group is.  What gave you the idea?\"\n\n\n \"It wasn't my idea, really,\" I admitted.  \"Mr. McCormack called me  to the office today, and told me that  some of the children in the lower  grades wanted to start one. They  need adult guidance of course, and  one of the group suggested my name.\"\n\n\n I should explain, perhaps, that I  teach a course in general science in  our Ridgeville Junior High School,  and another in general physics in the  Senior High School. It's a privilege  which I'm sure many educators must  envy, teaching in Ridgeville, for our  new school is a fine one, and our  academic standards are high. On the  other hand, the fathers of most of  my students work for the Commission  and a constant awareness of the Commission  and its work pervades the  town. It is an uneasy privilege then,  at least sometimes, to teach my old-fashioned  brand of science to these  children of a new age.\n\n\n \"That's very nice,\" said Marjorie.  \"What does a junior achievement  group do?\"\n\n\n \"It has the purpose,\" I told her,  \"of teaching the members something  about commerce and industry. They  manufacture simple compositions  like polishing waxes and sell them  from door-to-door. Some groups have  built up tidy little bank accounts  which are available for later educational  expenses.\"\n\n\n \"Gracious, you wouldn't have to  sell from door-to-door, would you?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not. I'd just tell the  kids how to do it.\"\n\n\n Marjorie put back her head and  laughed, and I was forced to join her,  for we both recognize that my understanding  and \"feel\" for commercial  matters\u2014if I may use that expression\u2014is  almost nonexistent.\n\n\n \"Oh, all right,\" I said, \"laugh at  my commercial aspirations. But don't  worry about it, really. Mr. McCormack  said we could get Mr. Wells from  Commercial Department to help out  if he was needed. There is one problem,  though. Mr. McCormack is going  to put up fifty dollars to buy any  raw materials wanted and he rather  suggested that I might advance another  fifty. The question is, could we  do it?\"\n\n\n Marjorie did mental arithmetic.  \"Yes,\" she said, \"yes, if it's something  you'd like to do.\"\n\n\n We've had to watch such things  rather closely for the last ten\u2014no,  eleven years. Back in the old Ridgeville,  fifty-odd miles to the south, we  had our home almost paid for, when  the accident occurred. It was in the  path of the heaviest fallout, and we  couldn't have kept on living there  even if the town had stayed. When  Ridgeville moved to its present site,  so, of course, did we, which meant  starting mortgage payments all over  again. Thus it was that on a Wednesday  morning about three weeks later, I  was sitting at one end of a plank picnic  table with five boys and girls  lined up along the sides. This was to  be our headquarters and factory for  the summer\u2014a roomy unused barn  belonging to the parents of one of  the group members, Tommy Miller.\n\n\n \"O.K.,\" I said, \"let's relax. You  don't need to treat me as a teacher,  you know. I stopped being a school  teacher when the final grades went in  last Friday. I'm on vacation now. My  job here is only to advise, and I'm  going to do that as little as possible.  You're going to decide what to do,  and if it's safe and legal and possible  to do with the starting capital we  have, I'll go along with it and help  in any way I can. This is your meeting.\"\n\n\n Mr. McCormack had told me, and  in some detail, about the youngsters  I'd be dealing with. The three who  were sitting to my left were the ones  who had proposed the group in the  first place.\n\n\n Doris Enright was a grave young  lady of ten years, who might, I  thought, be quite a beauty in a few  more years, but was at the moment  rather angular\u2014all shoulders and elbows.  Peter Cope, Jr. and Hilary Matlack  were skinny kids, too. The three  were of an age and were all tall for  ten-year-olds.\n\n\n I had the impression during that  first meeting that they looked rather  alike, but this wasn't so. Their features  were quite different. Perhaps  from association, for they were close  friends, they had just come to have  a certain similarity of restrained gesture  and of modulated voice. And  they were all tanned by sun and wind  to a degree that made their eyes seem  light and their teeth startlingly white.\n\n\n The two on my right were cast in  a different mold. Mary McCready  was a big husky redhead of twelve,  with a face full of freckles and an  infectious laugh, and Tommy Miller,  a few months younger, was just an  average, extroverted, well adjusted  youngster, noisy and restless, tee-shirted  and butch-barbered.\n\n\n The group exchanged looks to see  who would lead off, and Peter Cope  seemed to be elected.\n\n\n \"Well, Mr. Henderson, a junior  achievement group is a bunch of kids  who get together to manufacture and  sell things, and maybe make some  money.\"\n\n\n \"Is that what you want to do,\" I  asked, \"make money?\"\n\n\n \"Why not?\" Tommy asked.  \"There's something wrong with making  money?\"\n\n\n \"Well, sure, I suppose we want to,\"  said Hilary. \"We'll need some money  to do the things we want to do later.\"\n\n\n \"And what sort of things would  you like to make and sell?\" I asked.\n\n\n The usual products, of course, with  these junior achievement efforts, are  chemical specialties that can be made  safely and that people will buy and  use without misgivings\u2014solvent to  free up rusty bolts, cleaner to remove  road tar, mechanic's hand soap\u2014that  sort of thing. Mr. McCormack had  told me, though, that I might find  these youngsters a bit more ambitious.  \"The Miller boy and Mary McCready,\"  he had said, \"have exceptionally  high IQ's\u2014around one forty  or one fifty. The other three are hard  to classify. They have some of the  attributes of exceptional pupils, but  much of the time they seem to have  little interest in their studies. The  junior achievement idea has sparked  their imaginations. Maybe it'll be just  what they need.\"\n\n\n Mary said, \"Why don't we make a  freckle remover? I'd be our first customer.\" \"The thing to do,\" Tommy offered,  \"is to figure out what people in  Ridgeville want to buy, then sell it  to them.\"\n\n\n \"I'd like to make something by  powder metallurgy techniques,\" said  Pete. He fixed me with a challenging  eye. \"You should be able to make  ball bearings by molding, then densify  them by electroplating.\"\n\n\n \"And all we'd need is a hydraulic  press,\" I told him, \"which, on a guess,  might cost ten thousand dollars. Let's  think of something easier.\"\n\n\n Pete mulled it over and nodded  reluctantly. \"Then maybe something  in the electronics field. A hi-fi sub-assembly  of some kind.\"\n\n\n \"How about a new detergent?\" Hilary  put in.\n\n\n \"Like the liquid dishwashing detergents?\"  I asked.\n\n\n He was scornful. \"No, they're formulations\u2014you  know, mixtures.  That's cookbook chemistry. I mean a  brand new synthetic detergent. I've  got an idea for one that ought to be  good even in the hard water we've  got around here.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" I said, \"organic synthesis  sounds like another operation  calling for capital investment. If we  should keep the achievement group  going for several summers, it might  be possible later on to carry out a  safe synthesis of some sort. You're  Dr. Matlack's son, aren't you? Been  dipping into your father's library?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Hilary, \"and I've got  a home laboratory.\"\n\n\n \"How about you, Doris?\" I prompted.  \"Do you have a special field of interest?\"\n\n\n \"No.\" She shook her head in mock  despondency. \"I'm not very technical.  Just sort of miscellaneous. But if the  group wanted to raise some mice, I'd  be willing to turn over a project I've  had going at home.\"\n\n\n \"You could sell mice?\" Tommy demanded  incredulously.\n\n\n \"Mice,\" I echoed, then sat back and  thought about it. \"Are they a pure  strain? One of the recognized laboratory  strains? Healthy mice of the  right strain,\" I explained to Tommy,  \"might be sold to laboratories. I have  an idea the Commission buys a supply  every month.\"\n\n\n \"No,\" said Doris, \"these aren't laboratory  mice. They're fancy ones. I  got the first four pairs from a pet  shop in Denver, but they're red\u2014sort  of chipmunk color, you know. I've  carried them through seventeen generations  of careful selection.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" I admitted, \"the market  for red mice might be rather limited.  Why don't you consider making  an after-shave lotion? Denatured alcohol,  glycerine, water, a little color  and perfume. You could buy some  bottles and have some labels printed.  You'd be in business before you  knew it.\"\n\n\n There was a pause, then Tommy  inquired, \"How do you sell it?\"\n\n\n \"Door-to-door.\"\n\n\n He made a face. \"Never build up  any volume. Unless it did something  extra. You say we'd put color in it.  How about enough color to leave  your face looking tanned. Men won't  use cosmetics and junk, but if they  didn't have to admit it, they might  like the shave lotion.\"\n\n\n Hilary had been deep in thought.  He said suddenly, \"Gosh, I think I  know how to make a\u2014what do you  want to call it\u2014a before-shave lotion.\"\n\n\n \"What would that be?\" I asked.\n\n\n \"You'd use it before you shaved.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose there might be people  who'd prefer to use it beforehand,\"  I conceded.\n\n\n \"There will be people,\" he said  darkly, and subsided.\n\n\n Mrs. Miller came out to the barn  after a while, bringing a bucket of  soft drinks and ice, a couple of loaves  of bread and ingredients for a variety  of sandwiches. The parents had  agreed to underwrite lunches at the  barn and Betty Miller philosophically  assumed the role of commissary  officer. She paused only to say hello  and to ask how we were progressing  with our organization meeting.\n\n\n I'd forgotten all about organization,  and that, according to all the  articles I had perused, is most important  to such groups. It's standard practice  for every member of the group  to be a company officer. Of course a  young boy who doesn't know any better,  may wind up a sales manager.\n\n\n Over the sandwiches, then, I suggested  nominating company officers,  but they seemed not to be interested.  Peter Cope waved it off by remarking  that they'd each do what came  naturally. On the other hand, they  pondered at some length about a  name for the organization, without  reaching any conclusions, so we returned  to the problem of what to  make.\n\n\n It was Mary, finally, who advanced  the thought of kites. At first there  was little enthusiasm, then Peter said,  \"You know, we could work up something  new. Has anybody ever seen a  kite made like a wind sock?\"\n\n\n Nobody had. Pete drew figures in  the air with his hands. \"How about  the hole at the small end?\"\n\n\n \"I'll make one tonight,\" said Doris,  \"and think about the small end.  It'll work out all right.\"\n\n\n I wished that the youngsters weren't  starting out by inventing a new  article to manufacture, and risking an  almost certain disappointment, but to  hold my guidance to the minimum, I  said nothing, knowing that later I  could help them redesign it along  standard lines. At supper I reviewed the day's  happenings with Marjorie and tried  to recall all of the ideas which had  been propounded. Most of them were  impractical, of course, for a group of  children to attempt, but several of  them appeared quite attractive.\n\n\n Tommy, for example, wanted to  put tooth powder into tablets that  one would chew before brushing the  teeth. He thought there should be  two colors in the same bottle\u2014orange  for morning and blue for night,  the blue ones designed to leave the  mouth alkaline at bed time.\n\n\n Pete wanted to make a combination  nail and wood screw. You'd  drive it in with a hammer up to the  threaded part, then send it home with  a few turns of a screwdriver.\n\n\n Hilary, reluctantly forsaking his  ideas on detergents, suggested we  make black plastic discs, like poker  chips but thinner and as cheap as  possible, to scatter on a snowy sidewalk  where they would pick up extra  heat from the sun and melt the  snow more rapidly. Afterward one  would sweep up and collect the discs.\n\n\n Doris added to this that if you  could make the discs light enough to  float, they might be colored white  and spread on the surface of a reservoir  to reduce evaporation.\n\n\n These latter ideas had made unknowing  use of some basic physics,  and I'm afraid I relapsed for a few  minutes into the role of teacher and  told them a little bit about the laws  of radiation and absorption of heat.\n\n\n \"My,\" said Marjorie, \"they're really  smart boys and girls. Tommy Miller  does sound like a born salesman.  Somehow I don't think you're going  to have to call in Mr. Wells.\"\n\n\n I do feel just a little embarrassed  about the kite, even now. The fact  that it flew surprised me. That it flew  so confoundedly well was humiliating.  Four of them were at the barn  when I arrived next morning; or  rather on the rise of ground just beyond  it, and the kite hung motionless  and almost out of sight in the pale  sky. I stood and watched for a moment,  then they saw me.\n\n\n \"Hello, Mr. Henderson,\" Mary said,  and proffered the cord which was  wound on a fishing reel. I played the  kite up and down for a few minutes,  then reeled it in. It was, almost exactly,  a wind sock, but the hole at the  small end was shaped\u2014by wire\u2014into  the general form of a kidney bean.  It was beautifully made, and had a  sort of professional look about it.\n\n\n \"It flies too well,\" Mary told Doris.  \"A kite ought to get caught in a tree  sometimes.\"\n\n\n \"You're right,\" Doris agreed. \"Let's  see it.\" She gave the wire at the small  end the slightest of twists. \"There, it  ought to swoop.\"\n\n\n Sure enough, in the moderate  breeze of that morning, the kite  swooped and yawed to Mary's entire  satisfaction. As we trailed back to the  barn I asked Doris, \"How did you  know that flattening the lower edge  of the hole would create instability?\"  She looked doubtful.\n\n\n \"Why it would have to, wouldn't  it? It changed the pattern of air pressures.\"  She glanced at me quickly.  \"Of course, I tried a lot of different  shapes while I was making it.\"\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" I said, and let it go at  that. \"Where's Tommy?\"\n\n\n \"He stopped off at the bank,\" Pete  Cope told me, \"to borrow some money.  We'll want to buy materials to  make some of these kites.\"\n\n\n \"But I said yesterday that Mr. McCormack  and I were going to advance  some cash to get started.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, but don't you think it  would be better to borrow from a  bank? More businesslike?\"\n\n\n \"Doubtless,\" I said, \"but banks generally  want some security.\" I would  have gone on and explained matters  further, except that Tommy walked  in and handed me a pocket check  book.\n\n\n \"I got two hundred and fifty,\" he  volunteered\u2014not without a hint of  complacency in his voice. \"It didn't  take long, but they sure made it out  a big deal. Half the guys in the bank  had to be called in to listen to the  proposition. The account's in your  name, Mr. Henderson, and you'll have  to make out the checks. And they  want you to stop in at the bank and  give them a specimen signature. Oh,  yes, and cosign the note.\"\n\n\n My heart sank. I'd never had any  dealings with banks except in the  matter of mortgages, and bank people  make me most uneasy. To say  nothing of finding myself responsible  for a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar  note\u2014over two weeks salary. I made  a mental vow to sign very few checks.\n\n\n \"So then I stopped by at Apex  Stationers,\" Tommy went on, \"and ordered  some paper and envelopes. We  hadn't picked a name yesterday, but I  figured what's to lose, and picked one.  Ridge Industries, how's that?\" Everybody  nodded.\n\n\n \"Just three lines on the letterhead,\"  he explained. \"Ridge Industries\u2014Ridgeville\u2014Montana.\"\n\n\n I got my voice back and said, \"Engraved,  I trust.\"\n\n\n \"Well, sure,\" he replied. \"You can't  afford to look chintzy.\" My appetite was not at its best  that evening, and Marjorie recognized  that something was concerning  me, but she asked no questions, and  I only told her about the success of  the kite, and the youngsters embarking  on a shopping trip for paper, glue  and wood splints. There was no use  in both of us worrying.\n\n\n On Friday we all got down to work,  and presently had a regular production  line under way; stapling the  wood splints, then wetting them with  a resin solution and shaping them  over a mandrel to stiffen, cutting the  plastic film around a pattern, assembling  and hanging the finished kites  from an overhead beam until the cement  had set. Pete Cope had located  a big roll of red plastic film from  somewhere, and it made a wonderful-looking  kite. Happily, I didn't know  what the film cost until the first kites  were sold.\n\n\n By Wednesday of the following  week we had almost three hundred  kites finished and packed into flat  cardboard boxes, and frankly I didn't  care if I never saw another. Tommy,  who by mutual consent, was our  authority on sales, didn't want to sell  any until we had, as he put it, enough  to meet the demand, but this quantity  seemed to satisfy him. He said he  would sell them the next week and  Mary McCready, with a fine burst of  confidence, asked him in all seriousness  to be sure to hold out a dozen.\n\n\n Three other things occurred that  day, two of which I knew about immediately.  Mary brought a portable  typewriter from home and spent part  of the afternoon banging away at  what seemed to me, since I use two  fingers only, a very creditable speed.\n\n\n And Hilary brought in a bottle of  his new detergent. It was a syrupy  yellow liquid with a nice collar of  suds. He'd been busy in his home  laboratory after all, it seemed.\n\n\n \"What is it?\" I asked. \"You never  told us.\"\n\n\n Hilary grinned. \"Lauryl benzyl  phosphonic acid, dipotassium salt, in  20% solution.\"\n\n\n \"Goodness.\" I protested, \"it's been  twenty-five years since my last course  in chemistry. Perhaps if I saw the  formula\u2014.\"\n\n\n He gave me a singularly adult  smile and jotted down a scrawl of  symbols and lines. It meant little to  me.\n\n\n \"Is it good?\"\n\n\n For answer he seized the ice bucket,  now empty of its soda bottles,  trickled in a few drops from the bottle  and swished the contents. Foam  mounted to the rim and spilled over.  \"And that's our best grade of Ridgeville  water,\" he pointed out. \"Hardest  in the country.\"\n\n\n The third event of Wednesday  came to my ears on Thursday morning.\n\n\n I was a little late arriving at the  barn, and was taken a bit aback to  find the roadway leading to it rather  full of parked automobiles, and the  barn itself rather full of people, including  two policemen. Our Ridgeville  police are quite young men, but  in uniform they still look ominous  and I was relieved to see that they  were laughing and evidently enjoying  themselves.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" I demanded, in my  best classroom voice. \"What is all  this?\"\n\n\n \"Are you Henderson?\" the larger  policeman asked.\n\n\n \"I am indeed,\" I said, and a flash  bulb went off. A young lady grasped  my arm.\n\n\n \"Oh, please, Mr. Henderson, come  outside where it's quieter and tell me  all about it.\"\n\n\n \"Perhaps,\" I countered, \"somebody  should tell me.\"\n\n\n \"You mean you don't know, honestly?  Oh, it's fabulous. Best story I've  had for ages. It'll make the city papers.\"  She led me around the corner  of the barn to a spot of comparative  quiet.\n\n\n \"You didn't know that one of your  junior whatsisnames poured detergent  in the Memorial Fountain basin  last night?\"\n\n\n I shook my head numbly.\n\n\n \"It was priceless. Just before rush  hour. Suds built up in the basin and  overflowed, and down the library  steps and covered the whole street.  And the funniest part was they kept  right on coming. You couldn't imagine  so much suds coming from that  little pool of water. There was a  three-block traffic jam and Harry got  us some marvelous pictures\u2014men  rolling up their trousers to wade  across the street. And this morning,\"  she chortled, \"somebody phoned in  an anonymous tip to the police\u2014of  course it was the same boy that did  it\u2014Tommy\u2014Miller?\u2014and so here  we are. And we just saw a demonstration  of that fabulous kite and saw  all those simply captivating mice.\"\n\n\n \"Mice?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course. Who would ever  have thought you could breed mice  with those cute furry tails?\" Well, after a while things quieted  down. They had to. The police left  after sobering up long enough to  give me a serious warning against  letting such a thing happen again.  Mr. Miller, who had come home to  see what all the excitement was, went  back to work and Mrs. Miller went  back to the house and the reporter  and photographer drifted off to file  their story, or whatever it is they do.  Tommy was jubilant.\n\n\n \"Did you hear what she said? It'll  make the city papers. I wish we had  a thousand kites. Ten thousand. Oh  boy, selling is fun. Hilary, when can  you make some more of that stuff?  And Doris, how many mice do you  have?\"\n\n\n Those mice! I have always kept  my enthusiasm for rodents within  bounds, but I must admit they were  charming little beasts, with tails as  bushy as miniature squirrels.\n\n\n \"How many generations?\" I asked  Doris.\n\n\n \"Seventeen. No, eighteen, now.  Want to see the genetic charts?\"\n\n\n I won't try to explain it as she did  to me, but it was quite evident that  the new mice were breeding true.  Presently we asked Betty Miller to  come back down to the barn for a  conference. She listened and asked  questions. At last she said, \"Well, all  right, if you promise me they can't  get out of their cages. But heaven  knows what you'll do when fall  comes. They won't live in an unheated  barn and you can't bring them  into the house.\"\n\n\n \"We'll be out of the mouse business  by then,\" Doris predicted. \"Every pet  shop in the country will have  them and they'll be down to nothing  apiece.\"\n\n\n Doris was right, of course, in spite  of our efforts to protect the market.  Anyhow that ushered in our cage  building phase, and for the next  week\u2014with a few interruptions\u2014we  built cages, hundreds of them, a good  many for breeding, but mostly for  shipping.\n\n\n It was rather regrettable that, after  the Courier gave us most of the third  page, including photographs, we rarely  had a day without a few visitors.  Many of them wanted to buy mice or  kites, but Tommy refused to sell any  mice at retail and we soon had to disappoint  those who wanted kites. The  Supermarket took all we had\u2014except  a dozen\u2014and at a dollar fifty  each. Tommy's ideas of pricing rather  frightened me, but he set the value  of the mice at ten dollars a pair  and got it without any arguments.\n\n\n Our beautiful stationery arrived,  and we had some invoice forms printed  up in a hurry\u2014not engraved, for  a wonder.\n\n\n It was on Tuesday\u2014following the  Thursday\u2014that a lanky young man  disentangled himself from his car  and strolled into the barn. I looked  up from the floor where I was tacking  squares of screening onto wooden  frames.\n\n\n \"Hi,\" he said. \"You're Donald  Henderson, right? My name is McCord\u2014Jeff  McCord\u2014and I work in  the Patent Section at the Commission's  downtown office. My boss sent  me over here, but if he hadn't, I  think I'd have come anyway. What  are you doing to get patent protection  on Ridge Industries' new developments?\"\n\n\n I got my back unkinked and dusted  off my knees. \"Well, now,\" I said,  \"I've been wondering whether something  shouldn't be done, but I know  very little about such matters\u2014.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly,\" he broke in, \"we guessed  that might be the case, and there are  three patent men in our office who'd  like to chip in and contribute some  time. Partly for the kicks and partly  because we think you may have some  things worth protecting. How about  it? You worry about the filing and  final fees. That's sixty bucks per  brainstorm. We'll worry about everything  else.\"\n\n\n \"What's to lose,\" Tommy interjected.\n\n\n And so we acquired a patent attorney,  several of them, in fact.\n\n\n The day that our application on  the kite design went to Washington,  Mary wrote a dozen toy manufacturers  scattered from New York to Los  Angeles, sent a kite to each one and  offered to license the design. Result,  one licensee with a thousand dollar  advance against next season's royalties. It was a rainy morning about three  weeks later that I arrived at the barn.  Jeff McCord was there, and the whole  team except Tommy. Jeff lowered his  feet from the picnic table and said,  \"Hi.\"\n\n\n \"Hi yourself,\" I told him. \"You  look pleased.\"\n\n\n \"I am,\" he replied, \"in a cautious  legal sense, of course. Hilary and I  were just going over the situation on  his phosphonate detergent. I've spent  the last three nights studying the patent  literature and a few standard  texts touching on phosphonates.  There are a zillion patents on synthetic  detergents and a good round  fifty on phosphonates, but it looks\"\u2014he  held up a long admonitory hand\u2014\"it  just looks as though we had a clear  spot. If we do get protection, you've  got a real salable property.\"\n\n\n \"That's fine, Mr. McCord,\" Hilary  said, \"but it's not very important.\"\n\n\n \"No?\" Jeff tilted an inquiring eyebrow  at me, and I handed him a small  bottle. He opened and sniffed at it  gingerly. \"What gives?\"\n\n\n \"Before-shave lotion,\" Hilary told  him. \"You've shaved this morning,  but try some anyway.\"\n\n\n Jeff looked momentarily dubious,  then puddled some in his palm and  moistened his jaw line. \"Smells  good,\" he noted, \"and feels nice and  cool. Now what?\"\n\n\n \"Wipe your face.\" Jeff located a  handkerchief and wiped, looked at  the cloth, wiped again, and stared.\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"A whisker stiffener. It makes each  hair brittle enough to break off right  at the surface of your skin.\"\n\n\n \"So I perceive. What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, just a mixture of stuff. Cookbook  chemistry. Cysteine thiolactone  and a fat-soluble magnesium compound.\"\n\n\n \"I see. Just a mixture of stuff. And  do your whiskers grow back the next  day?\"\n\n\n \"Right on schedule,\" I said.\n\n\n McCord unfolded his length and  stood staring out into the rain. Presently  he said, \"Henderson, Hilary  and I are heading for my office. We  can work there better than here, and  if we're going to break the hearts of  the razor industry, there's no better  time to start than now.\"\n\n\n When they had driven off I turned  and said, \"Let's talk a while. We can  always clean mouse cages later.  Where's Tommy?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, he stopped at the bank to get  a loan.\"\n\n\n \"What on earth for? We have over  six thousand in the account.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Peter said, looking a little  embarrassed, \"we were planning to  buy a hydraulic press. You see, Doris  put some embroidery on that scheme  of mine for making ball bearings.\"  He grabbed a sheet of paper. \"Look,  we make a roller bearing, this shape  only it's a permanent magnet. Then  you see\u2014.\" And he was off.\n\n\n \"What did they do today, dear?\"  Marge asked as she refilled my coffee  cup.\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" I said. \"Let's see, it was  a big day. We picked out a hydraulic  press, Doris read us the first chapter  of the book she's starting, and we  found a place over a garage on  Fourth Street that we can rent for  winter quarters. Oh, yes, and Jeff is  starting action to get the company  incorporated.\"\n\n\n \"Winter quarters,\" Marge repeated.  \"You mean you're going to try to  keep the group going after school  starts?\"\n\n\n \"Why not? The kids can sail  through their courses without thinking  about them, and actually they  won't put in more than a few hours  a week during the school year.\"\n\n\n \"Even so, it's child labor, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Child labor nothing. They're the  employers. Jeff McCord and I will  be the only employees\u2014just at first,  anyway.\"\n\n\n Marge choked on something. \"Did  you say you'd be an employee?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told her. \"They've offered  me a small share of the company,  and I'd be crazy to turn it down. After  all, what's to lose?\" Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Analog Science Fact &amp; Fiction July 1962.

It was dried apricot pie, and very  tasty, I might add.\n\n\n \"Why, Donald,\" she said, \"it could  be quite interesting, if I understand  what a junior achievement group is.  What gave you the idea?\"\n\n\n \"It wasn't my idea, really,\" I admitted.  \"Mr. McCormack called me  to the office today, and told me that  some of the children in the lower  grades wanted to start one. They  need adult guidance of course, and  one of the group suggested my name.\"\n\n\n I should explain, perhaps, that I  teach a course in general science in  our Ridgeville Junior High School,  and another in general physics in the  Senior High School. It's a privilege  which I'm sure many educators must  envy, teaching in Ridgeville, for our  new school is a fine one, and our  academic standards are high. On the  other hand, the fathers of most of  my students work for the Commission  and a constant awareness of the Commission  and its work pervades the  town. It is an uneasy privilege then,  at least sometimes, to teach my old-fashioned  brand of science to these  children of a new age.\n\n\n \"That's very nice,\" said Marjorie.  \"What does a junior achievement  group do?\"\n\n\n \"It has the purpose,\" I told her,  \"of teaching the members something  about commerce and industry. They  manufacture simple compositions  like polishing waxes and sell them  from door-to-door. Some groups have  built up tidy little bank accounts  which are available for later educational  expenses.\"\n\n\n \"Gracious, you wouldn't have to  sell from door-to-door, would you?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not. I'd just tell the  kids how to do it.\"\n\n\n Marjorie put back her head and  laughed, and I was forced to join her,  for we both recognize that my understanding  and \"feel\" for commercial  matters\u2014if I may use that expression\u2014is  almost nonexistent.\n\n\n \"Oh, all right,\" I said, \"laugh at  my commercial aspirations. But don't  worry about it, really. Mr. McCormack  said we could get Mr. Wells from  Commercial Department to help out  if he was needed. There is one problem,  though. Mr. McCormack is going  to put up fifty dollars to buy any  raw materials wanted and he rather  suggested that I might advance another  fifty. The question is, could we  do it?\"\n\n\n Marjorie did mental arithmetic.  \"Yes,\" she said, \"yes, if it's something  you'd like to do.\"\n\n\n We've had to watch such things  rather closely for the last ten\u2014no,  eleven years. Back in the old Ridgeville,  fifty-odd miles to the south, we  had our home almost paid for, when  the accident occurred. It was in the  path of the heaviest fallout, and we  couldn't have kept on living there  even if the town had stayed. When  Ridgeville moved to its present site,  so, of course, did we, which meant  starting mortgage payments all over  again. Thus it was that on a Wednesday  morning about three weeks later, I  was sitting at one end of a plank picnic  table with five boys and girls  lined up along the sides. This was to  be our headquarters and factory for  the summer\u2014a roomy unused barn  belonging to the parents of one of  the group members, Tommy Miller.\n\n\n \"O.K.,\" I said, \"let's relax. You  don't need to treat me as a teacher,  you know. I stopped being a school  teacher when the final grades went in  last Friday. I'm on vacation now. My  job here is only to advise, and I'm  going to do that as little as possible.  You're going to decide what to do,  and if it's safe and legal and possible  to do with the starting capital we  have, I'll go along with it and help  in any way I can. This is your meeting.\"\n\n\n Mr. McCormack had told me, and  in some detail, about the youngsters  I'd be dealing with. The three who  were sitting to my left were the ones  who had proposed the group in the  first place.\n\n\n Doris Enright was a grave young  lady of ten years, who might, I  thought, be quite a beauty in a few  more years, but was at the moment  rather angular\u2014all shoulders and elbows.  Peter Cope, Jr. and Hilary Matlack  were skinny kids, too. The three  were of an age and were all tall for  ten-year-olds.\n\n\n I had the impression during that  first meeting that they looked rather  alike, but this wasn't so. Their features  were quite different. Perhaps  from association, for they were close  friends, they had just come to have  a certain similarity of restrained gesture  and of modulated voice. And  they were all tanned by sun and wind  to a degree that made their eyes seem  light and their teeth startlingly white.\n\n\n The two on my right were cast in  a different mold. Mary McCready  was a big husky redhead of twelve,  with a face full of freckles and an  infectious laugh, and Tommy Miller,  a few months younger, was just an  average, extroverted, well adjusted  youngster, noisy and restless, tee-shirted  and butch-barbered.\n\n\n The group exchanged looks to see  who would lead off, and Peter Cope  seemed to be elected.\n\n\n \"Well, Mr. Henderson, a junior  achievement group is a bunch of kids  who get together to manufacture and  sell things, and maybe make some  money.\"\n\n\n \"Is that what you want to do,\" I  asked, \"make money?\"\n\n\n \"Why not?\" Tommy asked.  \"There's something wrong with making  money?\"\n\n\n \"Well, sure, I suppose we want to,\"  said Hilary. \"We'll need some money  to do the things we want to do later.\"\n\n\n \"And what sort of things would  you like to make and sell?\" I asked.\n\n\n The usual products, of course, with  these junior achievement efforts, are  chemical specialties that can be made  safely and that people will buy and  use without misgivings\u2014solvent to  free up rusty bolts, cleaner to remove  road tar, mechanic's hand soap\u2014that  sort of thing. Mr. McCormack had  told me, though, that I might find  these youngsters a bit more ambitious.  \"The Miller boy and Mary McCready,\"  he had said, \"have exceptionally  high IQ's\u2014around one forty  or one fifty. The other three are hard  to classify. They have some of the  attributes of exceptional pupils, but  much of the time they seem to have  little interest in their studies. The  junior achievement idea has sparked  their imaginations. Maybe it'll be just  what they need.\"\n\n\n Mary said, \"Why don't we make a  freckle remover? I'd be our first customer.\" \"The thing to do,\" Tommy offered,  \"is to figure out what people in  Ridgeville want to buy, then sell it  to them.\"\n\n\n \"I'd like to make something by  powder metallurgy techniques,\" said  Pete. He fixed me with a challenging  eye. \"You should be able to make  ball bearings by molding, then densify  them by electroplating.\"\n\n\n \"And all we'd need is a hydraulic  press,\" I told him, \"which, on a guess,  might cost ten thousand dollars. Let's  think of something easier.\"\n\n\n Pete mulled it over and nodded  reluctantly. \"Then maybe something  in the electronics field. A hi-fi sub-assembly  of some kind.\"\n\n\n \"How about a new detergent?\" Hilary  put in.\n\n\n \"Like the liquid dishwashing detergents?\"  I asked.\n\n\n He was scornful. \"No, they're formulations\u2014you  know, mixtures.  That's cookbook chemistry. I mean a  brand new synthetic detergent. I've  got an idea for one that ought to be  good even in the hard water we've  got around here.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" I said, \"organic synthesis  sounds like another operation  calling for capital investment. If we  should keep the achievement group  going for several summers, it might  be possible later on to carry out a  safe synthesis of some sort. You're  Dr. Matlack's son, aren't you? Been  dipping into your father's library?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Hilary, \"and I've got  a home laboratory.\"\n\n\n \"How about you, Doris?\" I prompted.  \"Do you have a special field of interest?\"\n\n\n \"No.\" She shook her head in mock  despondency. \"I'm not very technical.  Just sort of miscellaneous. But if the  group wanted to raise some mice, I'd  be willing to turn over a project I've  had going at home.\"\n\n\n \"You could sell mice?\" Tommy demanded  incredulously.\n\n\n \"Mice,\" I echoed, then sat back and  thought about it. \"Are they a pure  strain? One of the recognized laboratory  strains? Healthy mice of the  right strain,\" I explained to Tommy,  \"might be sold to laboratories. I have  an idea the Commission buys a supply  every month.\"\n\n\n \"No,\" said Doris, \"these aren't laboratory  mice. They're fancy ones. I  got the first four pairs from a pet  shop in Denver, but they're red\u2014sort  of chipmunk color, you know. I've  carried them through seventeen generations  of careful selection.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" I admitted, \"the market  for red mice might be rather limited.  Why don't you consider making  an after-shave lotion? Denatured alcohol,  glycerine, water, a little color  and perfume. You could buy some  bottles and have some labels printed.  You'd be in business before you  knew it.\"\n\n\n There was a pause, then Tommy  inquired, \"How do you sell it?\"\n\n\n \"Door-to-door.\"\n\n\n He made a face. \"Never build up  any volume. Unless it did something  extra. You say we'd put color in it.  How about enough color to leave  your face looking tanned. Men won't  use cosmetics and junk, but if they  didn't have to admit it, they might  like the shave lotion.\"\n\n\n Hilary had been deep in thought.  He said suddenly, \"Gosh, I think I  know how to make a\u2014what do you  want to call it\u2014a before-shave lotion.\"\n\n\n \"What would that be?\" I asked.\n\n\n \"You'd use it before you shaved.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose there might be people  who'd prefer to use it beforehand,\"  I conceded.\n\n\n \"There will be people,\" he said  darkly, and subsided.\n\n\n Mrs. Miller came out to the barn  after a while, bringing a bucket of  soft drinks and ice, a couple of loaves  of bread and ingredients for a variety  of sandwiches. The parents had  agreed to underwrite lunches at the  barn and Betty Miller philosophically  assumed the role of commissary  officer. She paused only to say hello  and to ask how we were progressing  with our organization meeting.\n\n\n I'd forgotten all about organization,  and that, according to all the  articles I had perused, is most important  to such groups. It's standard practice  for every member of the group  to be a company officer. Of course a  young boy who doesn't know any better,  may wind up a sales manager.\n\n\n Over the sandwiches, then, I suggested  nominating company officers,  but they seemed not to be interested.  Peter Cope waved it off by remarking  that they'd each do what came  naturally. On the other hand, they  pondered at some length about a  name for the organization, without  reaching any conclusions, so we returned  to the problem of what to  make.\n\n\n It was Mary, finally, who advanced  the thought of kites. At first there  was little enthusiasm, then Peter said,  \"You know, we could work up something  new. Has anybody ever seen a  kite made like a wind sock?\"\n\n\n Nobody had. Pete drew figures in  the air with his hands. \"How about  the hole at the small end?\"\n\n\n \"I'll make one tonight,\" said Doris,  \"and think about the small end.  It'll work out all right.\"\n\n\n I wished that the youngsters weren't  starting out by inventing a new  article to manufacture, and risking an  almost certain disappointment, but to  hold my guidance to the minimum, I  said nothing, knowing that later I  could help them redesign it along  standard lines. At supper I reviewed the day's  happenings with Marjorie and tried  to recall all of the ideas which had  been propounded. Most of them were  impractical, of course, for a group of  children to attempt, but several of  them appeared quite attractive.\n\n\n Tommy, for example, wanted to  put tooth powder into tablets that  one would chew before brushing the  teeth. He thought there should be  two colors in the same bottle\u2014orange  for morning and blue for night,  the blue ones designed to leave the  mouth alkaline at bed time.\n\n\n Pete wanted to make a combination  nail and wood screw. You'd  drive it in with a hammer up to the  threaded part, then send it home with  a few turns of a screwdriver.\n\n\n Hilary, reluctantly forsaking his  ideas on detergents, suggested we  make black plastic discs, like poker  chips but thinner and as cheap as  possible, to scatter on a snowy sidewalk  where they would pick up extra  heat from the sun and melt the  snow more rapidly. Afterward one  would sweep up and collect the discs.\n\n\n Doris added to this that if you  could make the discs light enough to  float, they might be colored white  and spread on the surface of a reservoir  to reduce evaporation.\n\n\n These latter ideas had made unknowing  use of some basic physics,  and I'm afraid I relapsed for a few  minutes into the role of teacher and  told them a little bit about the laws  of radiation and absorption of heat.\n\n\n \"My,\" said Marjorie, \"they're really  smart boys and girls. Tommy Miller  does sound like a born salesman.  Somehow I don't think you're going  to have to call in Mr. Wells.\"\n\n\n I do feel just a little embarrassed  about the kite, even now. The fact  that it flew surprised me. That it flew  so confoundedly well was humiliating.  Four of them were at the barn  when I arrived next morning; or  rather on the rise of ground just beyond  it, and the kite hung motionless  and almost out of sight in the pale  sky. I stood and watched for a moment,  then they saw me.\n\n\n \"Hello, Mr. Henderson,\" Mary said,  and proffered the cord which was  wound on a fishing reel. I played the  kite up and down for a few minutes,  then reeled it in. It was, almost exactly,  a wind sock, but the hole at the  small end was shaped\u2014by wire\u2014into  the general form of a kidney bean.  It was beautifully made, and had a  sort of professional look about it.\n\n\n \"It flies too well,\" Mary told Doris.  \"A kite ought to get caught in a tree  sometimes.\"\n\n\n \"You're right,\" Doris agreed. \"Let's  see it.\" She gave the wire at the small  end the slightest of twists. \"There, it  ought to swoop.\"\n\n\n Sure enough, in the moderate  breeze of that morning, the kite  swooped and yawed to Mary's entire  satisfaction. As we trailed back to the  barn I asked Doris, \"How did you  know that flattening the lower edge  of the hole would create instability?\"  She looked doubtful.\n\n\n \"Why it would have to, wouldn't  it? It changed the pattern of air pressures.\"  She glanced at me quickly.  \"Of course, I tried a lot of different  shapes while I was making it.\"\n\n\n \"Naturally,\" I said, and let it go at  that. \"Where's Tommy?\"\n\n\n \"He stopped off at the bank,\" Pete  Cope told me, \"to borrow some money.  We'll want to buy materials to  make some of these kites.\"\n\n\n \"But I said yesterday that Mr. McCormack  and I were going to advance  some cash to get started.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, but don't you think it  would be better to borrow from a  bank? More businesslike?\"\n\n\n \"Doubtless,\" I said, \"but banks generally  want some security.\" I would  have gone on and explained matters  further, except that Tommy walked  in and handed me a pocket check  book.\n\n\n \"I got two hundred and fifty,\" he  volunteered\u2014not without a hint of  complacency in his voice. \"It didn't  take long, but they sure made it out  a big deal. Half the guys in the bank  had to be called in to listen to the  proposition. The account's in your  name, Mr. Henderson, and you'll have  to make out the checks. And they  want you to stop in at the bank and  give them a specimen signature. Oh,  yes, and cosign the note.\"\n\n\n My heart sank. I'd never had any  dealings with banks except in the  matter of mortgages, and bank people  make me most uneasy. To say  nothing of finding myself responsible  for a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar  note\u2014over two weeks salary. I made  a mental vow to sign very few checks.\n\n\n \"So then I stopped by at Apex  Stationers,\" Tommy went on, \"and ordered  some paper and envelopes. We  hadn't picked a name yesterday, but I  figured what's to lose, and picked one.  Ridge Industries, how's that?\" Everybody  nodded.\n\n\n \"Just three lines on the letterhead,\"  he explained. \"Ridge Industries\u2014Ridgeville\u2014Montana.\"\n\n\n I got my voice back and said, \"Engraved,  I trust.\"\n\n\n \"Well, sure,\" he replied. \"You can't  afford to look chintzy.\" My appetite was not at its best  that evening, and Marjorie recognized  that something was concerning  me, but she asked no questions, and  I only told her about the success of  the kite, and the youngsters embarking  on a shopping trip for paper, glue  and wood splints. There was no use  in both of us worrying.\n\n\n On Friday we all got down to work,  and presently had a regular production  line under way; stapling the  wood splints, then wetting them with  a resin solution and shaping them  over a mandrel to stiffen, cutting the  plastic film around a pattern, assembling  and hanging the finished kites  from an overhead beam until the cement  had set. Pete Cope had located  a big roll of red plastic film from  somewhere, and it made a wonderful-looking  kite. Happily, I didn't know  what the film cost until the first kites  were sold.\n\n\n By Wednesday of the following  week we had almost three hundred  kites finished and packed into flat  cardboard boxes, and frankly I didn't  care if I never saw another. Tommy,  who by mutual consent, was our  authority on sales, didn't want to sell  any until we had, as he put it, enough  to meet the demand, but this quantity  seemed to satisfy him. He said he  would sell them the next week and  Mary McCready, with a fine burst of  confidence, asked him in all seriousness  to be sure to hold out a dozen.\n\n\n Three other things occurred that  day, two of which I knew about immediately.  Mary brought a portable  typewriter from home and spent part  of the afternoon banging away at  what seemed to me, since I use two  fingers only, a very creditable speed.\n\n\n And Hilary brought in a bottle of  his new detergent. It was a syrupy  yellow liquid with a nice collar of  suds. He'd been busy in his home  laboratory after all, it seemed.\n\n\n \"What is it?\" I asked. \"You never  told us.\"\n\n\n Hilary grinned. \"Lauryl benzyl  phosphonic acid, dipotassium salt, in  20% solution.\"\n\n\n \"Goodness.\" I protested, \"it's been  twenty-five years since my last course  in chemistry. Perhaps if I saw the  formula\u2014.\"\n\n\n He gave me a singularly adult  smile and jotted down a scrawl of  symbols and lines. It meant little to  me.\n\n\n \"Is it good?\"\n\n\n For answer he seized the ice bucket,  now empty of its soda bottles,  trickled in a few drops from the bottle  and swished the contents. Foam  mounted to the rim and spilled over.  \"And that's our best grade of Ridgeville  water,\" he pointed out. \"Hardest  in the country.\"\n\n\n The third event of Wednesday  came to my ears on Thursday morning.\n\n\n I was a little late arriving at the  barn, and was taken a bit aback to  find the roadway leading to it rather  full of parked automobiles, and the  barn itself rather full of people, including  two policemen. Our Ridgeville  police are quite young men, but  in uniform they still look ominous  and I was relieved to see that they  were laughing and evidently enjoying  themselves.\n\n\n \"Well, now,\" I demanded, in my  best classroom voice. \"What is all  this?\"\n\n\n \"Are you Henderson?\" the larger  policeman asked.\n\n\n \"I am indeed,\" I said, and a flash  bulb went off. A young lady grasped  my arm.\n\n\n \"Oh, please, Mr. Henderson, come  outside where it's quieter and tell me  all about it.\"\n\n\n \"Perhaps,\" I countered, \"somebody  should tell me.\"\n\n\n \"You mean you don't know, honestly?  Oh, it's fabulous. Best story I've  had for ages. It'll make the city papers.\"  She led me around the corner  of the barn to a spot of comparative  quiet.\n\n\n \"You didn't know that one of your  junior whatsisnames poured detergent  in the Memorial Fountain basin  last night?\"\n\n\n I shook my head numbly.\n\n\n \"It was priceless. Just before rush  hour. Suds built up in the basin and  overflowed, and down the library  steps and covered the whole street.  And the funniest part was they kept  right on coming. You couldn't imagine  so much suds coming from that  little pool of water. There was a  three-block traffic jam and Harry got  us some marvelous pictures\u2014men  rolling up their trousers to wade  across the street. And this morning,\"  she chortled, \"somebody phoned in  an anonymous tip to the police\u2014of  course it was the same boy that did  it\u2014Tommy\u2014Miller?\u2014and so here  we are. And we just saw a demonstration  of that fabulous kite and saw  all those simply captivating mice.\"\n\n\n \"Mice?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course. Who would ever  have thought you could breed mice  with those cute furry tails?\" Well, after a while things quieted  down. They had to. The police left  after sobering up long enough to  give me a serious warning against  letting such a thing happen again.  Mr. Miller, who had come home to  see what all the excitement was, went  back to work and Mrs. Miller went  back to the house and the reporter  and photographer drifted off to file  their story, or whatever it is they do.  Tommy was jubilant.\n\n\n \"Did you hear what she said? It'll  make the city papers. I wish we had  a thousand kites. Ten thousand. Oh  boy, selling is fun. Hilary, when can  you make some more of that stuff?  And Doris, how many mice do you  have?\"\n\n\n Those mice! I have always kept  my enthusiasm for rodents within  bounds, but I must admit they were  charming little beasts, with tails as  bushy as miniature squirrels.\n\n\n \"How many generations?\" I asked  Doris.\n\n\n \"Seventeen. No, eighteen, now.  Want to see the genetic charts?\"\n\n\n I won't try to explain it as she did  to me, but it was quite evident that  the new mice were breeding true.  Presently we asked Betty Miller to  come back down to the barn for a  conference. She listened and asked  questions. At last she said, \"Well, all  right, if you promise me they can't  get out of their cages. But heaven  knows what you'll do when fall  comes. They won't live in an unheated  barn and you can't bring them  into the house.\"\n\n\n \"We'll be out of the mouse business  by then,\" Doris predicted. \"Every pet  shop in the country will have  them and they'll be down to nothing  apiece.\"\n\n\n Doris was right, of course, in spite  of our efforts to protect the market.  Anyhow that ushered in our cage  building phase, and for the next  week\u2014with a few interruptions\u2014we  built cages, hundreds of them, a good  many for breeding, but mostly for  shipping.\n\n\n It was rather regrettable that, after  the Courier gave us most of the third  page, including photographs, we rarely  had a day without a few visitors.  Many of them wanted to buy mice or  kites, but Tommy refused to sell any  mice at retail and we soon had to disappoint  those who wanted kites. The  Supermarket took all we had\u2014except  a dozen\u2014and at a dollar fifty  each. Tommy's ideas of pricing rather  frightened me, but he set the value  of the mice at ten dollars a pair  and got it without any arguments.\n\n\n Our beautiful stationery arrived,  and we had some invoice forms printed  up in a hurry\u2014not engraved, for  a wonder.\n\n\n It was on Tuesday\u2014following the  Thursday\u2014that a lanky young man  disentangled himself from his car  and strolled into the barn. I looked  up from the floor where I was tacking  squares of screening onto wooden  frames.\n\n\n \"Hi,\" he said. \"You're Donald  Henderson, right? My name is McCord\u2014Jeff  McCord\u2014and I work in  the Patent Section at the Commission's  downtown office. My boss sent  me over here, but if he hadn't, I  think I'd have come anyway. What  are you doing to get patent protection  on Ridge Industries' new developments?\"\n\n\n I got my back unkinked and dusted  off my knees. \"Well, now,\" I said,  \"I've been wondering whether something  shouldn't be done, but I know  very little about such matters\u2014.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly,\" he broke in, \"we guessed  that might be the case, and there are  three patent men in our office who'd  like to chip in and contribute some  time. Partly for the kicks and partly  because we think you may have some  things worth protecting. How about  it? You worry about the filing and  final fees. That's sixty bucks per  brainstorm. We'll worry about everything  else.\"\n\n\n \"What's to lose,\" Tommy interjected.\n\n\n And so we acquired a patent attorney,  several of them, in fact.\n\n\n The day that our application on  the kite design went to Washington,  Mary wrote a dozen toy manufacturers  scattered from New York to Los  Angeles, sent a kite to each one and  offered to license the design. Result,  one licensee with a thousand dollar  advance against next season's royalties. It was a rainy morning about three  weeks later that I arrived at the barn.  Jeff McCord was there, and the whole  team except Tommy. Jeff lowered his  feet from the picnic table and said,  \"Hi.\"\n\n\n \"Hi yourself,\" I told him. \"You  look pleased.\"\n\n\n \"I am,\" he replied, \"in a cautious  legal sense, of course. Hilary and I  were just going over the situation on  his phosphonate detergent. I've spent  the last three nights studying the patent  literature and a few standard  texts touching on phosphonates.  There are a zillion patents on synthetic  detergents and a good round  fifty on phosphonates, but it looks\"\u2014he  held up a long admonitory hand\u2014\"it  just looks as though we had a clear  spot. If we do get protection, you've  got a real salable property.\"\n\n\n \"That's fine, Mr. McCord,\" Hilary  said, \"but it's not very important.\"\n\n\n \"No?\" Jeff tilted an inquiring eyebrow  at me, and I handed him a small  bottle. He opened and sniffed at it  gingerly. \"What gives?\"\n\n\n \"Before-shave lotion,\" Hilary told  him. \"You've shaved this morning,  but try some anyway.\"\n\n\n Jeff looked momentarily dubious,  then puddled some in his palm and  moistened his jaw line. \"Smells  good,\" he noted, \"and feels nice and  cool. Now what?\"\n\n\n \"Wipe your face.\" Jeff located a  handkerchief and wiped, looked at  the cloth, wiped again, and stared.\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"A whisker stiffener. It makes each  hair brittle enough to break off right  at the surface of your skin.\"\n\n\n \"So I perceive. What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, just a mixture of stuff. Cookbook  chemistry. Cysteine thiolactone  and a fat-soluble magnesium compound.\"\n\n\n \"I see. Just a mixture of stuff. And  do your whiskers grow back the next  day?\"\n\n\n \"Right on schedule,\" I said.\n\n\n McCord unfolded his length and  stood staring out into the rain. Presently  he said, \"Henderson, Hilary  and I are heading for my office. We  can work there better than here, and  if we're going to break the hearts of  the razor industry, there's no better  time to start than now.\"\n\n\n When they had driven off I turned  and said, \"Let's talk a while. We can  always clean mouse cages later.  Where's Tommy?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, he stopped at the bank to get  a loan.\"\n\n\n \"What on earth for? We have over  six thousand in the account.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Peter said, looking a little  embarrassed, \"we were planning to  buy a hydraulic press. You see, Doris  put some embroidery on that scheme  of mine for making ball bearings.\"  He grabbed a sheet of paper. \"Look,  we make a roller bearing, this shape  only it's a permanent magnet. Then  you see\u2014.\" And he was off.\n\n\n \"What did they do today, dear?\"  Marge asked as she refilled my coffee  cup.\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" I said. \"Let's see, it was  a big day. We picked out a hydraulic  press, Doris read us the first chapter  of the book she's starting, and we  found a place over a garage on  Fourth Street that we can rent for  winter quarters. Oh, yes, and Jeff is  starting action to get the company  incorporated.\"\n\n\n \"Winter quarters,\" Marge repeated.  \"You mean you're going to try to  keep the group going after school  starts?\"\n\n\n \"Why not? The kids can sail  through their courses without thinking  about them, and actually they  won't put in more than a few hours  a week during the school year.\"\n\n\n \"Even so, it's child labor, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Child labor nothing. They're the  employers. Jeff McCord and I will  be the only employees\u2014just at first,  anyway.\"\n\n\n Marge choked on something. \"Did  you say you'd be an employee?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told her. \"They've offered  me a small share of the company,  and I'd be crazy to turn it down. After  all, what's to lose?\" Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Analog Science Fact &amp; Fiction July 1962.
