      "background_text": "THE DOPE\n\n on Mars By JACK SHARKEY Somebody had to get the human  angle on this trip ... but what  was humane about sending me? Illustrated by WOOD My  agent was the one who  got me the job of going  along to write up the first  trip to Mars. He was always getting  me things like that\u2014appearances  on TV shows, or mentions in writers'  magazines. If he didn't sell  much of my stuff, at least he sold me .\n\n\n \"It'll be the biggest break a  writer ever got,\" he told me, two  days before blastoff. \"Oh, sure  there'll be scientific reports on the  trip, but the public doesn't want  them; they want the human slant  on things.\"\n\n\n \"But, Louie,\" I said weakly, \"I'll  probably be locked up for the  whole trip. If there are fights or accidents,  they won't tell me about  them.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense,\" said Louie, sipping  carefully at a paper cup of scalding  coffee. \"It'll be just like the  public going along vicariously.  They'll identify with you.\"\n\n\n \"But, Louie,\" I said, wiping the  dampness from my palms on the  knees of my trousers as I sat there,  \"how'll I go about it? A story? An  article? A you-are-there type of report?  What?\"\n\n\n Louie shrugged. \"So keep a  diary. It'll be more intimate, like.\"\n\n\n \"But what if nothing happens?\"  I insisted hopelessly.\n\n\n Louie smiled. \"So you fake it.\"\n\n\n I got up from the chair in his office  and stepped to the door.  \"That's dishonest,\" I pointed out.\n\n\n \"Creative is the word,\" Louie  said.\n\n\n So I went on the first trip to  Mars. And I kept a diary. This is  it. And it is honest. Honest it is. October 1, 1960 They picked  the launching  date from the March, 1959, New  York Times , which stated that this  was the most likely time for launching.  Trip time is supposed to take  260 days (that's one way), so  we're aimed toward where Mars  will be (had better be, or else).\n\n\n There are five of us on board. A  pilot, co-pilot, navigator and biochemist.  And, of course, me. I've  met all but the pilot (he's very  busy today), and they seem friendly  enough.\n\n\n Dwight Kroger, the biochemist,  is rather old to take the \"rigors of  the journey,\" as he puts it, but the  government had a choice between  sending a green scientist who could  stand the trip or an accomplished  man who would probably not survive,  so they picked Kroger. We've  blasted off, though, and he's still  with us. He looks a damn sight better  than I feel. He's kind of balding,  and very iron-gray-haired and  skinny, but his skin is tan as an Indian's,  and right now he's telling  jokes in the washroom with the co-pilot.\n\n\n Jones (that's the co-pilot; I  didn't quite catch his first name) is  scarlet-faced, barrel-chested and  gives the general appearance of belonging  under the spreading chestnut  tree, not in a metal bullet flinging  itself out into airless space.  Come to think of it, who does belong  where we are?\n\n\n The navigator's name is Lloyd  Streeter, but I haven't seen his face  yet. He has a little cubicle behind  the pilot's compartment, with all  kinds of maps and rulers and things.  He keeps bent low over a welded-to-the-wall  (they call it the bulkhead,  for some reason or other)  table, scratching away with a ballpoint  pen on the maps, and now  and then calling numbers over a  microphone to the pilot. His hair  is red and curly, and he looks as  though he'd be tall if he ever gets  to stand up. There are freckles on  the backs of his hands, so I think  he's probably got them on his face,  too. So far, all he's said is, \"Scram,  I'm busy.\"\n\n\n Kroger tells me that the pilot's  name is Patrick Desmond, but that  I can call him Pat when I get to  know him better. So far, he's still  Captain Desmond to me. I haven't  the vaguest idea what he looks like.  He was already on board when I  got here, with my typewriter and  ream of paper, so we didn't meet.\n\n\n My compartment is small but  clean. I mean clean now. It wasn't  during blastoff. The inertial gravities  didn't bother me so much as  the gyroscopic spin they put on the  ship so we have a sort of artificial  gravity to hold us against the  curved floor. It's that constant  whirly feeling that gets me. I get  sick on merry-go-rounds, too.\n\n\n They're having pork for dinner  today. Not me. October 2, 1960 Feeling much  better today.  Kroger gave me a box of Dramamine  pills. He says they'll help my  stomach. So far, so good.\n\n\n Lloyd came by, also. \"You play  chess?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"A little,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"How about a game sometime?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I said. \"Do you have a  board?\"\n\n\n He didn't.\n\n\n Lloyd went away then, but the  interview wasn't wasted. I learned  that he is tall and does have a  freckled face. Maybe we can build  a chessboard. With my paper and  his ballpoint pen and ruler, it should  be easy. Don't know what we'll use  for pieces, though.\n\n\n Jones (I still haven't learned his  first name) has been up with the  pilot all day. He passed my room  on the way to the galley (the  kitchen) for a cup of dark brown  coffee (they like it thick) and told  me that we were almost past the  Moon. I asked to look, but he said  not yet; the instrument panel is  Top Secret. They'd have to cover  it so I could look out the viewing  screen, and they still need it for  steering or something.\n\n\n I still haven't met the pilot. October 3, 1960 Well, I've  met the pilot. He is  kind of squat, with a vulturish neck  and close-set jet-black eyes that  make him look rather mean, but he  was pleasant enough, and said I  could call him Pat. I still don't  know Jones' first name, though Pat  spoke to him, and it sounded like  Flants. That can't be right.\n\n\n Also, I am one of the first five  men in the history of the world to  see the opposite side of the Moon,  with a bluish blurred crescent beyond  it that Pat said was the Earth.  The back of the Moon isn't much  different from the front. As to the  space in front of the ship, well, it's  all black with white dots in it, and  none of the dots move, except in a  circle that Pat says is a \"torque\"  result from the gyroscopic spin  we're in. Actually, he explained to  me, the screen is supposed to keep  the image of space locked into  place no matter how much we spin.  But there's some kind of a \"drag.\"  I told him I hoped it didn't mean  we'd land on Mars upside down. He  just stared at me.\n\n\n I can't say I was too impressed  with that 16 x 19 view of outer  space. It's been done much better  in the movies. There's just no awesomeness  to it, no sense of depth or  immensity. It's as impressive as a  piece of velvet with salt sprinkled  on it.\n\n\n Lloyd and I made a chessboard  out of a carton. Right now we're using  buttons for men. He's one of  these fast players who don't stop  and think out their moves. And so  far I haven't won a game.\n\n\n It looks like a long trip. October 4, 1960 I won  a game. Lloyd mistook my  queen-button for my bishop-button  and left his king in jeopardy, and  I checkmated him next move. He  said chess was a waste of time  and he had important work to do  and he went away.\n\n\n I went to the galley for coffee  and had a talk about moss with  Kroger. He said there was a good  chance of lichen on Mars, and I  misunderstood and said, \"A good  chance of liking what on Mars?\"  and Kroger finished his coffee and  went up front.\n\n\n When I got back to my compartment,  Lloyd had taken away the  chessboard and all his buttons. He  told me later he needed it to back  up a star map.\n\n\n Pat slept mostly all day in his  compartment, and Jones sat and  watched the screen revolve. There  wasn't much to do, so I wrote a  poem, sort of.\n\nMary, Mary, quite contrary,   How does your garden grow?   With Martian rime, Venusian slime,   And a radioactive hoe.  \n\n I showed it to Kroger. He says  it may prove to be environmentally  accurate, but that I should stick to  prose. October 5, 1960 Learned Jones'  first name.  He wrote something in the ship's  log, and I saw his signature. His  name is Fleance, like in \"Macbeth.\"  He prefers to be called Jones. Pat  uses his first name as a gag. Some  fun.\n\n\n And only 255 days to go. April 1, 1961 I've skipped  over the last 177  days or so, because there's nothing  much new. I brought some books  with me on the trip, books that I'd  always meant to read and never  had the time. So now I know all  about Vanity Fair , Pride and Prejudice , War and Peace , Gone with  the Wind , and Babbitt .\n\n\n They didn't take as long as I  thought they would, except for Vanity Fair . It must have been a  riot when it first came out. I mean,  all those sly digs at the aristocracy,  with copious interpolations by Mr.  Thackeray in case you didn't get  it when he'd pulled a particularly  good gag. Some fun.\n\n\n And only 78 days to go. June 1, 1961 Only 17 days  to go. I saw Mars  on the screen today. It seems to be  descending from overhead, but Pat  says that that's the \"torque\" doing  it. Actually, it's we who are coming  in sideways.\n\n\n We've all grown beards, too. Pat  said it was against regulations, but  what the hell. We have a contest.  Longest whiskers on landing gets a  prize.\n\n\n I asked Pat what the prize was  and he told me to go to hell. June 18, 1961 Mars has  the whole screen  filled. Looks like Death Valley. No  sign of canals, but Pat says that's  because of the dust storm down below.  It's nice to have a \"down below\"  again. We're going to land, so  I have to go to my bunk. It's all  foam rubber, nylon braid supports  and magnesium tubing. Might as  well be cement for all the good it  did me at takeoff. Earth seems awfully  far away. June 19, 1961 Well, we're down.  We have  to wear gas masks with oxygen  hook-ups. Kroger says the air is  breathable, but thin, and it has too  much dust in it to be any fun to  inhale. He's all for going out and  looking for lichen, but Pat says he's  got to set up camp, then get instructions  from Earth. So we just have  to wait. The air is very cold, but the  Sun is hot as hell when it hits you.  The sky is a blinding pink, or maybe  more of a pale fuchsia. Kroger  says it's the dust. The sand underfoot  is kind of rose-colored, and not  really gritty. The particles are  round and smooth.\n\n\n No lichen so far. Kroger says  maybe in the canals, if there are  any canals. Lloyd wants to play  chess again.\n\n\n Jones won the beard contest. Pat  gave him a cigar he'd smuggled on  board (no smoking was allowed on  the ship), and Jones threw it away.  He doesn't smoke. June 20, 1961 Got lost today.  Pat told me  not to go too far from camp, so,  when I took a stroll, I made sure  every so often that I could still see  the rocket behind me. Walked for  maybe an hour; then the oxygen  gauge got past the halfway mark,  so I started back toward the rocket.  After maybe ten steps, the rocket  disappeared. One minute it was  standing there, tall and silvery, the  next instant it was gone.\n\n\n Turned on my radio pack and  got hold of Pat. Told him what happened,  and he told Kroger. Kroger  said I had been following a mirage,  to step back a bit. I did, and I could  see the ship again. Kroger said to  try and walk toward where the ship  seemed to be, even when it wasn't  in view, and meantime they'd come  out after me in the jeep, following  my footprints.\n\n\n Started walking back, and the  ship vanished again. It reappeared,  disappeared, but I kept going. Finally  saw the real ship, and Lloyd  and Jones waving their arms at me.  They were shouting through their  masks, but I couldn't hear them.  The air is too thin to carry sound  well.\n\n\n All at once, something gleamed  in their hands, and they started  shooting at me with their rifles.  That's when I heard the noise behind  me. I was too scared to turn  around, but finally Jones and Lloyd  came running over, and I got up  enough nerve to look. There was  nothing there, but on the sand,  paralleling mine, were footprints.  At least I think they were footprints.  Twice as long as mine, and  three times as wide, but kind of  featureless because the sand's loose  and dry. They doubled back on  themselves, spaced considerably  farther apart.\n\n\n \"What was it?\" I asked Lloyd  when he got to me.\n\n\n \"Damned if I know,\" he said. \"It  was red and scaly, and I think it  had a tail. It was two heads taller  than you.\" He shuddered. \"Ran off  when we fired.\"\n\n\n \"Where,\" said Jones, \"are Pat and  Kroger?\"\n\n\n I didn't know. I hadn't seen  them, nor the jeep, on my trip back.  So we followed the wheel tracks for  a while, and they veered off from  my trail and followed another, very  much like the one that had been  paralleling mine when Jones and  Lloyd had taken a shot at the scaly  thing.\n\n\n \"We'd better get them on the  radio,\" said Jones, turning back  toward the ship.\n\n\n There wasn't anything on the  radio but static.\n\n\n Pat and Kroger haven't come  back yet, either. June 21, 1961 We're not  alone here. More of  the scaly things have come toward  the camp, but a few rifle shots send  them away. They hop like kangaroos  when they're startled. Their  attitudes aren't menacing, but their  appearance is. And Jones says,  \"Who knows what's 'menacing' in  an alien?\"\n\n\n We're going to look for Kroger  and Pat today. Jones says we'd better  before another windstorm blows  away the jeep tracks. Fortunately,  the jeep has a leaky oil pan, so we  always have the smears to follow,  unless they get covered up, too.  We're taking extra oxygen, shells,  and rifles. Food, too, of course.  And we're locking up the ship. It's later  , now. We found the  jeep, but no Kroger or Pat. Lots of  those big tracks nearby. We're taking  the jeep to follow the aliens'  tracks. There's some moss around  here, on reddish brown rocks that  stick up through the sand, just on  the shady side, though. Kroger  must be happy to have found his  lichen.\n\n\n The trail ended at the brink of  a deep crevice in the ground. Seems  to be an earthquake-type split in  solid rock, with the sand sifting  over this and the far edge like pink  silk cataracts. The bottom is in the  shade and can't be seen. The crack  seems to extend to our left and  right as far as we can look.\n\n\n There looks like a trail down the  inside of the crevice, but the Sun's  setting, so we're waiting till tomorrow  to go down.\n\n\n Going down was Jones' idea,  not mine. June 22, 1961 Well, we're  at the bottom, and  there's water here, a shallow stream  about thirty feet wide that runs  along the center of the canal (we've  decided we're in a canal). No sign  of Pat or Kroger yet, but the sand  here is hard-packed and damp, and  there are normal-size footprints  mingled with the alien ones, sharp  and clear. The aliens seem to have  six or seven toes. It varies from  print to print. And they're barefoot,  too, or else they have the damnedest-looking  shoes in creation.\n\n\n The constant shower of sand  near the cliff walls is annoying, but  it's sandless (shower-wise) near  the stream, so we're following the  footprints along the bank. Also, the  air's better down here. Still thin,  but not so bad as on the surface.  We're going without masks to save  oxygen for the return trip (Jones  assures me there'll be a return  trip), and the air's only a little bit  sandy, but handkerchiefs over nose  and mouth solve this.\n\n\n We look like desperadoes, what  with the rifles and covered faces. I  said as much to Lloyd and he told  me to shut up. Moss all over the  cliff walls. Swell luck for Kroger. We've found  Kroger and Pat,  with the help of the aliens. Or maybe  I should call them the Martians.  Either way, it's better than what  Jones calls them.\n\n\n They took away our rifles and  brought us right to Kroger and Pat,  without our even asking. Jones is  mad at the way they got the rifles so  easily. When we came upon them  (a group of maybe ten, huddling  behind a boulder in ambush), he  fired, but the shots either bounced  off their scales or stuck in their  thick hides. Anyway, they took the  rifles away and threw them into the  stream, and picked us all up and  took us into a hole in the cliff wall.  The hole went on practically forever,  but it didn't get dark. Kroger  tells me that there are phosphorescent  bacteria living in the mold on  the walls. The air has a fresh-dug-grave  smell, but it's richer in oxygen  than even at the stream.\n\n\n We're in a small cave that is just  off a bigger cave where lots of tunnels  come together. I can't remember  which one we came in through,  and neither can anyone else. Jones  asked me what the hell I kept writing  in the diary for, did I want to  make it a gift to Martian archeologists?  But I said where there's life  there's hope, and now he won't talk  to me. I congratulated Kroger on  the lichen I'd seen, but he just said  a short and unscientific word and  went to sleep.\n\n\n There's a Martian guarding the  entrance to our cave. I don't know  what they intend to do with us.  Feed us, I hope. So far, they've just  left us here, and we're out of rations.\n\n\n Kroger tried talking to the guard  once, but he (or it) made a whistling  kind of sound and flashed a  mouthful of teeth. Kroger says the  teeth are in multiple rows, like a  tiger shark's. I'd rather he hadn't  told me. June 23, 1961, I think We're either  in a docket or a  zoo. I can't tell which. There's a  rather square platform surrounded  on all four sides by running water,  maybe twenty feet across, and  we're on it. Martians keep coming  to the far edge of the water and  looking at us and whistling at each  other. A little Martian came near  the edge of the water and a larger  Martian whistled like crazy and  dragged it away.\n\n\n \"Water must be dangerous to  them,\" said Kroger.\n\n\n \"We shoulda brought water pistols,\"  Jones muttered.\n\n\n Pat said maybe we can swim to  safety. Kroger told Pat he was  crazy, that the little island we're on  here underground is bordered by a  fast river that goes into the planet.  We'd end up drowned in some grotto  in the heart of the planet, says  Kroger.\n\n\n \"What the hell,\" says Pat, \"it's  better than starving.\"\n\n\n It is not. June 24, 1961, probably I'm hungry  . So is everybody  else. Right now I could eat a dinner  raw, in a centrifuge, and keep it  down. A Martian threw a stone at  Jones today, and Jones threw one  back at him and broke off a couple  of scales. The Martian whistled  furiously and went away. When the  crowd thinned out, same as it did  yesterday (must be some sort of  sleeping cycle here), Kroger talked  Lloyd into swimming across the  river and getting the red scales.  Lloyd started at the upstream part  of the current, and was about a hundred  yards below this underground  island before he made the far side.  Sure is a swift current.\n\n\n But he got the scales, walked  very far upstream of us, and swam  back with them. The stream sides  are steep, like in a fjord, and we  had to lift him out of the swirling  cold water, with the scales gripped  in his fist. Or what was left of the  scales. They had melted down in  the water and left his hand all  sticky.\n\n\n Kroger took the gummy things,  studied them in the uncertain light,  then tasted them and grinned.\n\n\n The Martians are made of sugar. Later, same day  . Kroger  said that the Martian metabolism  must be like Terran (Earth-type)  metabolism, only with no pancreas  to make insulin. They store their  energy on the outside of their  bodies, in the form of scales. He's  watched them more closely and  seen that they have long rubbery  tubes for tongues, and that they  now and then suck up water from  the stream while they're watching  us, being careful not to get their lips  (all sugar, of course) wet. He  guesses that their \"blood\" must be  almost pure water, and that it  washes away (from the inside, of  course) the sugar they need for  energy.\n\n\n I asked him where the sugar  came from, and he said probably  their bodies isolated carbon from  something (he thought it might be  the moss) and combined it with  the hydrogen and oxygen in the  water (even I knew the formula for  water) to make sugar, a common  carbohydrate.\n\n\n Like plants, on Earth, he said.  Except, instead of using special  cells on leaves to form carbohydrates  with the help of sunpower,  as Earth plants do in photosynthesis  (Kroger spelled that word  for me), they used the shape of the  scales like prisms, to isolate the  spectra (another Kroger word)  necessary to form the sugar.\n\n\n \"I don't get it,\" I said politely,  when he'd finished his spiel.\n\n\n \"Simple,\" he said, as though he  were addressing me by name.  \"They have a twofold reason to fear  water. One: by complete solvency  in that medium, they lose all energy  and die. Two: even partial sprinkling  alters the shape of the scales,  and they are unable to use sunpower  to form more sugar, and still die,  if a bit slower.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said, taking it down verbatim.  \"So now what do we do?\"\n\n\n \"We remove our boots,\" said  Kroger, sitting on the ground and  doing so, \"and then we cross this  stream, fill the boots with water,  and spray our way to freedom.\"\n\n\n \"Which tunnel do we take?\"  asked Pat, his eyes aglow at the  thought of escape.\n\n\n Kroger shrugged. \"We'll have to  chance taking any that seem to  slope upward. In any event, we can  always follow it back and start  again.\"\n\n\n \"I dunno,\" said Jones. \"Remember  those teeth of theirs. They must  be for biting something more substantial  than moss, Kroger.\"\n\n\n \"We'll risk it,\" said Pat. \"It's better  to go down fighting than to die  of starvation.\"\n\n\n The hell it is. June 24, 1961, for sure The Martians  have coal  mines. That's what they use those  teeth for. We passed through one  and surprised a lot of them chewing  gritty hunks of anthracite out  of the walls. They came running at  us, whistling with those tubelike  tongues, and drooling dry coal dust,  but Pat swung one of his boots in  an arc that splashed all over the  ground in front of them, and they  turned tail (literally) and clattered  off down another tunnel,  sounding like a locomotive whistle  gone berserk.\n\n\n We made the surface in another  hour, back in the canal, and were  lucky enough to find our own trail  to follow toward the place above  which the jeep still waited.\n\n\n Jones got the rifles out of the  stream (the Martians had probably  thought they were beyond recovery  there) and we found the jeep. It  was nearly buried in sand, but we  got it cleaned off and running, and  got back to the ship quickly. First  thing we did on arriving was to  break out the stores and have a  celebration feast just outside the  door of the ship.\n\n\n It was pork again, and I got sick. June 25, 1961 We're going back  . Pat says  that a week is all we were allowed  to stay and that it's urgent to return  and tell what we've learned  about Mars (we know there are  Martians, and they're made of  sugar).\n\n\n \"Why,\" I said, \"can't we just tell  it on the radio?\"\n\n\n \"Because,\" said Pat, \"if we tell  them now, by the time we get back  we'll be yesterday's news. This way  we may be lucky and get a parade.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe even money,\" said  Kroger, whose mind wasn't always  on science.\n\n\n \"But they'll ask why we didn't  radio the info, sir,\" said Jones uneasily.\n\n\n \"The radio,\" said Pat, nodding to  Lloyd, \"was unfortunately broken  shortly after landing.\"\n\n\n Lloyd blinked, then nodded  back and walked around the  rocket. I heard a crunching sound  and the shattering of glass, not unlike  the noise made when one  drives a rifle butt through a radio.\n\n\n Well, it's time for takeoff. This time  it wasn't so bad. I  thought I was getting my space-legs,  but Pat says there's less gravity on  Mars, so escape velocity didn't  have to be so fast, hence a smoother  (relatively) trip on our shock-absorbing  bunks.\n\n\n Lloyd wants to play chess again.  I'll be careful not to win this time.  However, if I don't win, maybe this  time I'll be the one to quit.\n\n\n Kroger is busy in his cramped  lab space trying to classify the little  moss he was able to gather, and  Jones and Pat are up front watching  the white specks revolve on that  black velvet again.\n\n\n Guess I'll take a nap. June 26, 1961 Hell's bells  . Kroger says  there are two baby Martians loose  on board ship. Pat told him he  was nuts, but there are certain  signs he's right. Like the missing  charcoal in the air-filtration-and-reclaiming  (AFAR) system. And  the water gauges are going down.  But the clincher is those two sugar  crystals Lloyd had grabbed up  when we were in that zoo. They're  gone.\n\n\n Pat has declared a state of emergency.  Quick thinking, that's Pat.  Lloyd, before he remembered and  turned scarlet, suggested we radio  Earth for instructions. We can't.\n\n\n Here we are, somewhere in a  void headed for Earth, with enough  air and water left for maybe three  days\u2014if the Martians don't take  any more.\n\n\n Kroger is thrilled that he is  learning something, maybe, about  Martian reproductive processes.  When he told Pat, Pat put it to a  vote whether or not to jettison  Kroger through the airlock. However,  it was decided that responsibility  was pretty well divided.  Lloyd had gotten the crystals,  Kroger had only studied them, and  Jones had brought them aboard.\n\n\n So Kroger stays, but meanwhile  the air is getting worse. Pat suggested  Kroger put us all into a state  of suspended animation till landing  time, eight months away. Kroger  said, \"How?\" June 27, 1961 Air is foul  and I'm very  thirsty. Kroger says that at least\u2014when  the Martians get bigger\u2014they'll  have to show themselves.  Pat says what do we do then ? We  can't afford the water we need to  melt them down. Besides, the  melted crystals might all turn into  little Martians.\n\n\n Jones says he'll go down spitting.\n\n\n Pat says why not dismantle interior  of rocket to find out where  they're holing up? Fine idea.\n\n\n How do you dismantle riveted  metal plates? June 28, 1961 The AFAR system  is no more  and the water gauges are still dropping.  Kroger suggests baking bread,  then slicing it, then toasting it till  it turns to carbon, and we can use  the carbon in the AFAR system.\n\n\n We'll have to try it, I guess. The Martians  ate the bread.  Jones came forward to tell us the  loaves were cooling, and when he  got back they were gone. However,  he did find a few of the red crystals  on the galley deck (floor). They're  good-sized crystals, too. Which  means so are the Martians.\n\n\n Kroger says the Martians must  be intelligent, otherwise they  couldn't have guessed at the carbohydrates  present in the bread after  a lifelong diet of anthracite. Pat  says let's jettison Kroger.\n\n\n This time the vote went against  Kroger, but he got a last-minute reprieve  by suggesting the crystals  be pulverized and mixed with sulphuric  acid. He says this'll produce  carbon.\n\n\n I certainly hope so.\n\n\n So does Kroger. Brief reprieve  for us. The  acid-sugar combination not only  produces carbon but water vapor,  and the gauge has gone up a notch.  That means that we have a quart  of water in the tanks for drinking.  However, the air's a bit better,  and we voted to let Kroger stay inside  the rocket.\n\n\n Meantime, we have to catch  those Martians. June 29, 1961 Worse and worse  . Lloyd  caught one of the Martians in the  firing chamber. We had to flood  the chamber with acid to subdue  the creature, which carbonized  nicely. So now we have plenty of  air and water again, but besides  having another Martian still on  the loose, we now don't have  enough acid left in the fuel tanks  to make a landing.\n\n\n Pat says at least our vector will  carry us to Earth and we can die  on our home planet, which is better  than perishing in space.\n\n\n The hell it is. March 3, 1962 Earth in sight  . The other  Martian is still with us. He's where  we can't get at him without blow-torches,  but he can't get at the carbon  in the AFAR system, either,  which is a help. However, his tail  is prehensile, and now and then it  snakes out through an air duct and  yanks food right off the table from  under our noses.\n\n\n Kroger says watch out. We are  made of carbohydrates, too. I'd  rather not have known. March 4, 1962 Earth fills  the screen in the  control room. Pat says if we're  lucky, he might be able to use the  bit of fuel we have left to set us  in a descending spiral into one of  the oceans. The rocket is tighter  than a submarine, he insists, and  it will float till we're rescued, if  the plates don't crack under the impact.\n\n\n We all agreed to try it. Not that  we thought it had a good chance of  working, but none of us had a better  idea. I guess  you know the rest of  the story, about how that destroyer  spotted us and got us and  my diary aboard, and towed the  rocket to San Francisco. News of  the \"captured Martian\" leaked out,  and we all became nine-day wonders  until the dismantling of the  rocket.\n\n\n Kroger says he must have dissolved  in the water, and wonders  what that would do. There are  about a thousand of those crystal-scales  on a Martian.\n\n\n So last week we found out, when  those red-scaled things began clambering  out of the sea on every coastal  region on Earth. Kroger tried  to explain to me about salinity osmosis  and hydrostatic pressure and  crystalline life, but in no time at all  he lost me.\n\n\n The point is, bullets won't stop  these things, and wherever a crystal  falls, a new Martian springs up  in a few weeks. It looks like the  five of us have abetted an invasion  from Mars.\n\n\n Needless to say, we're no longer  heroes.\n\n\n I haven't heard from Pat or  Lloyd for a week. Jones was picked  up attacking a candy factory yesterday,  and Kroger and I were allowed  to sign on for the flight to  Venus scheduled within the next  few days\u2014because of our experience.\n\n\n Kroger says there's only enough  fuel for a one-way trip. I don't care.  I've always wanted to travel with  the President. \u2014JACK SHARKEY Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Magazine June 1960.

Illustrated by WOOD My  agent was the one who  got me the job of going  along to write up the first  trip to Mars. He was always getting  me things like that\u2014appearances  on TV shows, or mentions in writers'  magazines. If he didn't sell  much of my stuff, at least he sold me .\n\n\n \"It'll be the biggest break a  writer ever got,\" he told me, two  days before blastoff. \"Oh, sure  there'll be scientific reports on the  trip, but the public doesn't want  them; they want the human slant  on things.\"\n\n\n \"But, Louie,\" I said weakly, \"I'll  probably be locked up for the  whole trip. If there are fights or accidents,  they won't tell me about  them.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense,\" said Louie, sipping  carefully at a paper cup of scalding  coffee. \"It'll be just like the  public going along vicariously.  They'll identify with you.\"\n\n\n \"But, Louie,\" I said, wiping the  dampness from my palms on the  knees of my trousers as I sat there,  \"how'll I go about it? A story? An  article? A you-are-there type of report?  What?\"\n\n\n Louie shrugged. \"So keep a  diary. It'll be more intimate, like.\"\n\n\n \"But what if nothing happens?\"  I insisted hopelessly.\n\n\n Louie smiled. \"So you fake it.\"\n\n\n I got up from the chair in his office  and stepped to the door.  \"That's dishonest,\" I pointed out.\n\n\n \"Creative is the word,\" Louie  said.\n\n\n So I went on the first trip to  Mars. And I kept a diary. This is  it. And it is honest. Honest it is. October 1, 1960 They picked  the launching  date from the March, 1959, New  York Times , which stated that this  was the most likely time for launching.  Trip time is supposed to take  260 days (that's one way), so  we're aimed toward where Mars  will be (had better be, or else).\n\n\n There are five of us on board. A  pilot, co-pilot, navigator and biochemist.  And, of course, me. I've  met all but the pilot (he's very  busy today), and they seem friendly  enough.\n\n\n Dwight Kroger, the biochemist,  is rather old to take the \"rigors of  the journey,\" as he puts it, but the  government had a choice between  sending a green scientist who could  stand the trip or an accomplished  man who would probably not survive,  so they picked Kroger. We've  blasted off, though, and he's still  with us. He looks a damn sight better  than I feel. He's kind of balding,  and very iron-gray-haired and  skinny, but his skin is tan as an Indian's,  and right now he's telling  jokes in the washroom with the co-pilot.\n\n\n Jones (that's the co-pilot; I  didn't quite catch his first name) is  scarlet-faced, barrel-chested and  gives the general appearance of belonging  under the spreading chestnut  tree, not in a metal bullet flinging  itself out into airless space.  Come to think of it, who does belong  where we are?\n\n\n The navigator's name is Lloyd  Streeter, but I haven't seen his face  yet. He has a little cubicle behind  the pilot's compartment, with all  kinds of maps and rulers and things.  He keeps bent low over a welded-to-the-wall  (they call it the bulkhead,  for some reason or other)  table, scratching away with a ballpoint  pen on the maps, and now  and then calling numbers over a  microphone to the pilot. His hair  is red and curly, and he looks as  though he'd be tall if he ever gets  to stand up. There are freckles on  the backs of his hands, so I think  he's probably got them on his face,  too. So far, all he's said is, \"Scram,  I'm busy.\"\n\n\n Kroger tells me that the pilot's  name is Patrick Desmond, but that  I can call him Pat when I get to  know him better. So far, he's still  Captain Desmond to me. I haven't  the vaguest idea what he looks like.  He was already on board when I  got here, with my typewriter and  ream of paper, so we didn't meet.\n\n\n My compartment is small but  clean. I mean clean now. It wasn't  during blastoff. The inertial gravities  didn't bother me so much as  the gyroscopic spin they put on the  ship so we have a sort of artificial  gravity to hold us against the  curved floor. It's that constant  whirly feeling that gets me. I get  sick on merry-go-rounds, too.\n\n\n They're having pork for dinner  today. Not me. October 2, 1960 Feeling much  better today.  Kroger gave me a box of Dramamine  pills. He says they'll help my  stomach. So far, so good.\n\n\n Lloyd came by, also. \"You play  chess?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"A little,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"How about a game sometime?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I said. \"Do you have a  board?\"\n\n\n He didn't.\n\n\n Lloyd went away then, but the  interview wasn't wasted. I learned  that he is tall and does have a  freckled face. Maybe we can build  a chessboard. With my paper and  his ballpoint pen and ruler, it should  be easy. Don't know what we'll use  for pieces, though.\n\n\n Jones (I still haven't learned his  first name) has been up with the  pilot all day. He passed my room  on the way to the galley (the  kitchen) for a cup of dark brown  coffee (they like it thick) and told  me that we were almost past the  Moon. I asked to look, but he said  not yet; the instrument panel is  Top Secret. They'd have to cover  it so I could look out the viewing  screen, and they still need it for  steering or something.\n\n\n I still haven't met the pilot. October 3, 1960 Well, I've  met the pilot. He is  kind of squat, with a vulturish neck  and close-set jet-black eyes that  make him look rather mean, but he  was pleasant enough, and said I  could call him Pat. I still don't  know Jones' first name, though Pat  spoke to him, and it sounded like  Flants. That can't be right.\n\n\n Also, I am one of the first five  men in the history of the world to  see the opposite side of the Moon,  with a bluish blurred crescent beyond  it that Pat said was the Earth.  The back of the Moon isn't much  different from the front. As to the  space in front of the ship, well, it's  all black with white dots in it, and  none of the dots move, except in a  circle that Pat says is a \"torque\"  result from the gyroscopic spin  we're in. Actually, he explained to  me, the screen is supposed to keep  the image of space locked into  place no matter how much we spin.  But there's some kind of a \"drag.\"  I told him I hoped it didn't mean  we'd land on Mars upside down. He  just stared at me.\n\n\n I can't say I was too impressed  with that 16 x 19 view of outer  space. It's been done much better  in the movies. There's just no awesomeness  to it, no sense of depth or  immensity. It's as impressive as a  piece of velvet with salt sprinkled  on it.\n\n\n Lloyd and I made a chessboard  out of a carton. Right now we're using  buttons for men. He's one of  these fast players who don't stop  and think out their moves. And so  far I haven't won a game.\n\n\n It looks like a long trip. October 4, 1960 I won  a game. Lloyd mistook my  queen-button for my bishop-button  and left his king in jeopardy, and  I checkmated him next move. He  said chess was a waste of time  and he had important work to do  and he went away.\n\n\n I went to the galley for coffee  and had a talk about moss with  Kroger. He said there was a good  chance of lichen on Mars, and I  misunderstood and said, \"A good  chance of liking what on Mars?\"  and Kroger finished his coffee and  went up front.\n\n\n When I got back to my compartment,  Lloyd had taken away the  chessboard and all his buttons. He  told me later he needed it to back  up a star map.\n\n\n Pat slept mostly all day in his  compartment, and Jones sat and  watched the screen revolve. There  wasn't much to do, so I wrote a  poem, sort of.\n\nMary, Mary, quite contrary,   How does your garden grow?   With Martian rime, Venusian slime,   And a radioactive hoe.  \n\n I showed it to Kroger. He says  it may prove to be environmentally  accurate, but that I should stick to  prose. October 5, 1960 Learned Jones'  first name.  He wrote something in the ship's  log, and I saw his signature. His  name is Fleance, like in \"Macbeth.\"  He prefers to be called Jones. Pat  uses his first name as a gag. Some  fun.\n\n\n And only 255 days to go. April 1, 1961 I've skipped  over the last 177  days or so, because there's nothing  much new. I brought some books  with me on the trip, books that I'd  always meant to read and never  had the time. So now I know all  about Vanity Fair , Pride and Prejudice , War and Peace , Gone with  the Wind , and Babbitt .\n\n\n They didn't take as long as I  thought they would, except for Vanity Fair . It must have been a  riot when it first came out. I mean,  all those sly digs at the aristocracy,  with copious interpolations by Mr.  Thackeray in case you didn't get  it when he'd pulled a particularly  good gag. Some fun.\n\n\n And only 78 days to go. June 1, 1961 Only 17 days  to go. I saw Mars  on the screen today. It seems to be  descending from overhead, but Pat  says that that's the \"torque\" doing  it. Actually, it's we who are coming  in sideways.\n\n\n We've all grown beards, too. Pat  said it was against regulations, but  what the hell. We have a contest.  Longest whiskers on landing gets a  prize.\n\n\n I asked Pat what the prize was  and he told me to go to hell. June 18, 1961 Mars has  the whole screen  filled. Looks like Death Valley. No  sign of canals, but Pat says that's  because of the dust storm down below.  It's nice to have a \"down below\"  again. We're going to land, so  I have to go to my bunk. It's all  foam rubber, nylon braid supports  and magnesium tubing. Might as  well be cement for all the good it  did me at takeoff. Earth seems awfully  far away. June 19, 1961 Well, we're down.  We have  to wear gas masks with oxygen  hook-ups. Kroger says the air is  breathable, but thin, and it has too  much dust in it to be any fun to  inhale. He's all for going out and  looking for lichen, but Pat says he's  got to set up camp, then get instructions  from Earth. So we just have  to wait. The air is very cold, but the  Sun is hot as hell when it hits you.  The sky is a blinding pink, or maybe  more of a pale fuchsia. Kroger  says it's the dust. The sand underfoot  is kind of rose-colored, and not  really gritty. The particles are  round and smooth.\n\n\n No lichen so far. Kroger says  maybe in the canals, if there are  any canals. Lloyd wants to play  chess again.\n\n\n Jones won the beard contest. Pat  gave him a cigar he'd smuggled on  board (no smoking was allowed on  the ship), and Jones threw it away.  He doesn't smoke. June 20, 1961 Got lost today.  Pat told me  not to go too far from camp, so,  when I took a stroll, I made sure  every so often that I could still see  the rocket behind me. Walked for  maybe an hour; then the oxygen  gauge got past the halfway mark,  so I started back toward the rocket.  After maybe ten steps, the rocket  disappeared. One minute it was  standing there, tall and silvery, the  next instant it was gone.\n\n\n Turned on my radio pack and  got hold of Pat. Told him what happened,  and he told Kroger. Kroger  said I had been following a mirage,  to step back a bit. I did, and I could  see the ship again. Kroger said to  try and walk toward where the ship  seemed to be, even when it wasn't  in view, and meantime they'd come  out after me in the jeep, following  my footprints.\n\n\n Started walking back, and the  ship vanished again. It reappeared,  disappeared, but I kept going. Finally  saw the real ship, and Lloyd  and Jones waving their arms at me.  They were shouting through their  masks, but I couldn't hear them.  The air is too thin to carry sound  well.\n\n\n All at once, something gleamed  in their hands, and they started  shooting at me with their rifles.  That's when I heard the noise behind  me. I was too scared to turn  around, but finally Jones and Lloyd  came running over, and I got up  enough nerve to look. There was  nothing there, but on the sand,  paralleling mine, were footprints.  At least I think they were footprints.  Twice as long as mine, and  three times as wide, but kind of  featureless because the sand's loose  and dry. They doubled back on  themselves, spaced considerably  farther apart.\n\n\n \"What was it?\" I asked Lloyd  when he got to me.\n\n\n \"Damned if I know,\" he said. \"It  was red and scaly, and I think it  had a tail. It was two heads taller  than you.\" He shuddered. \"Ran off  when we fired.\"\n\n\n \"Where,\" said Jones, \"are Pat and  Kroger?\"\n\n\n I didn't know. I hadn't seen  them, nor the jeep, on my trip back.  So we followed the wheel tracks for  a while, and they veered off from  my trail and followed another, very  much like the one that had been  paralleling mine when Jones and  Lloyd had taken a shot at the scaly  thing.\n\n\n \"We'd better get them on the  radio,\" said Jones, turning back  toward the ship.\n\n\n There wasn't anything on the  radio but static.\n\n\n Pat and Kroger haven't come  back yet, either. June 21, 1961 We're not  alone here. More of  the scaly things have come toward  the camp, but a few rifle shots send  them away. They hop like kangaroos  when they're startled. Their  attitudes aren't menacing, but their  appearance is. And Jones says,  \"Who knows what's 'menacing' in  an alien?\"\n\n\n We're going to look for Kroger  and Pat today. Jones says we'd better  before another windstorm blows  away the jeep tracks. Fortunately,  the jeep has a leaky oil pan, so we  always have the smears to follow,  unless they get covered up, too.  We're taking extra oxygen, shells,  and rifles. Food, too, of course.  And we're locking up the ship. It's later  , now. We found the  jeep, but no Kroger or Pat. Lots of  those big tracks nearby. We're taking  the jeep to follow the aliens'  tracks. There's some moss around  here, on reddish brown rocks that  stick up through the sand, just on  the shady side, though. Kroger  must be happy to have found his  lichen.\n\n\n The trail ended at the brink of  a deep crevice in the ground. Seems  to be an earthquake-type split in  solid rock, with the sand sifting  over this and the far edge like pink  silk cataracts. The bottom is in the  shade and can't be seen. The crack  seems to extend to our left and  right as far as we can look.\n\n\n There looks like a trail down the  inside of the crevice, but the Sun's  setting, so we're waiting till tomorrow  to go down.\n\n\n Going down was Jones' idea,  not mine. June 22, 1961 Well, we're  at the bottom, and  there's water here, a shallow stream  about thirty feet wide that runs  along the center of the canal (we've  decided we're in a canal). No sign  of Pat or Kroger yet, but the sand  here is hard-packed and damp, and  there are normal-size footprints  mingled with the alien ones, sharp  and clear. The aliens seem to have  six or seven toes. It varies from  print to print. And they're barefoot,  too, or else they have the damnedest-looking  shoes in creation.\n\n\n The constant shower of sand  near the cliff walls is annoying, but  it's sandless (shower-wise) near  the stream, so we're following the  footprints along the bank. Also, the  air's better down here. Still thin,  but not so bad as on the surface.  We're going without masks to save  oxygen for the return trip (Jones  assures me there'll be a return  trip), and the air's only a little bit  sandy, but handkerchiefs over nose  and mouth solve this.\n\n\n We look like desperadoes, what  with the rifles and covered faces. I  said as much to Lloyd and he told  me to shut up. Moss all over the  cliff walls. Swell luck for Kroger. We've found  Kroger and Pat,  with the help of the aliens. Or maybe  I should call them the Martians.  Either way, it's better than what  Jones calls them.\n\n\n They took away our rifles and  brought us right to Kroger and Pat,  without our even asking. Jones is  mad at the way they got the rifles so  easily. When we came upon them  (a group of maybe ten, huddling  behind a boulder in ambush), he  fired, but the shots either bounced  off their scales or stuck in their  thick hides. Anyway, they took the  rifles away and threw them into the  stream, and picked us all up and  took us into a hole in the cliff wall.  The hole went on practically forever,  but it didn't get dark. Kroger  tells me that there are phosphorescent  bacteria living in the mold on  the walls. The air has a fresh-dug-grave  smell, but it's richer in oxygen  than even at the stream.\n\n\n We're in a small cave that is just  off a bigger cave where lots of tunnels  come together. I can't remember  which one we came in through,  and neither can anyone else. Jones  asked me what the hell I kept writing  in the diary for, did I want to  make it a gift to Martian archeologists?  But I said where there's life  there's hope, and now he won't talk  to me. I congratulated Kroger on  the lichen I'd seen, but he just said  a short and unscientific word and  went to sleep.\n\n\n There's a Martian guarding the  entrance to our cave. I don't know  what they intend to do with us.  Feed us, I hope. So far, they've just  left us here, and we're out of rations.\n\n\n Kroger tried talking to the guard  once, but he (or it) made a whistling  kind of sound and flashed a  mouthful of teeth. Kroger says the  teeth are in multiple rows, like a  tiger shark's. I'd rather he hadn't  told me. June 23, 1961, I think We're either  in a docket or a  zoo. I can't tell which. There's a  rather square platform surrounded  on all four sides by running water,  maybe twenty feet across, and  we're on it. Martians keep coming  to the far edge of the water and  looking at us and whistling at each  other. A little Martian came near  the edge of the water and a larger  Martian whistled like crazy and  dragged it away.\n\n\n \"Water must be dangerous to  them,\" said Kroger.\n\n\n \"We shoulda brought water pistols,\"  Jones muttered.\n\n\n Pat said maybe we can swim to  safety. Kroger told Pat he was  crazy, that the little island we're on  here underground is bordered by a  fast river that goes into the planet.  We'd end up drowned in some grotto  in the heart of the planet, says  Kroger.\n\n\n \"What the hell,\" says Pat, \"it's  better than starving.\"\n\n\n It is not. June 24, 1961, probably I'm hungry  . So is everybody  else. Right now I could eat a dinner  raw, in a centrifuge, and keep it  down. A Martian threw a stone at  Jones today, and Jones threw one  back at him and broke off a couple  of scales. The Martian whistled  furiously and went away. When the  crowd thinned out, same as it did  yesterday (must be some sort of  sleeping cycle here), Kroger talked  Lloyd into swimming across the  river and getting the red scales.  Lloyd started at the upstream part  of the current, and was about a hundred  yards below this underground  island before he made the far side.  Sure is a swift current.\n\n\n But he got the scales, walked  very far upstream of us, and swam  back with them. The stream sides  are steep, like in a fjord, and we  had to lift him out of the swirling  cold water, with the scales gripped  in his fist. Or what was left of the  scales. They had melted down in  the water and left his hand all  sticky.\n\n\n Kroger took the gummy things,  studied them in the uncertain light,  then tasted them and grinned.\n\n\n The Martians are made of sugar. Later, same day  . Kroger  said that the Martian metabolism  must be like Terran (Earth-type)  metabolism, only with no pancreas  to make insulin. They store their  energy on the outside of their  bodies, in the form of scales. He's  watched them more closely and  seen that they have long rubbery  tubes for tongues, and that they  now and then suck up water from  the stream while they're watching  us, being careful not to get their lips  (all sugar, of course) wet. He  guesses that their \"blood\" must be  almost pure water, and that it  washes away (from the inside, of  course) the sugar they need for  energy.\n\n\n I asked him where the sugar  came from, and he said probably  their bodies isolated carbon from  something (he thought it might be  the moss) and combined it with  the hydrogen and oxygen in the  water (even I knew the formula for  water) to make sugar, a common  carbohydrate.\n\n\n Like plants, on Earth, he said.  Except, instead of using special  cells on leaves to form carbohydrates  with the help of sunpower,  as Earth plants do in photosynthesis  (Kroger spelled that word  for me), they used the shape of the  scales like prisms, to isolate the  spectra (another Kroger word)  necessary to form the sugar.\n\n\n \"I don't get it,\" I said politely,  when he'd finished his spiel.\n\n\n \"Simple,\" he said, as though he  were addressing me by name.  \"They have a twofold reason to fear  water. One: by complete solvency  in that medium, they lose all energy  and die. Two: even partial sprinkling  alters the shape of the scales,  and they are unable to use sunpower  to form more sugar, and still die,  if a bit slower.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said, taking it down verbatim.  \"So now what do we do?\"\n\n\n \"We remove our boots,\" said  Kroger, sitting on the ground and  doing so, \"and then we cross this  stream, fill the boots with water,  and spray our way to freedom.\"\n\n\n \"Which tunnel do we take?\"  asked Pat, his eyes aglow at the  thought of escape.\n\n\n Kroger shrugged. \"We'll have to  chance taking any that seem to  slope upward. In any event, we can  always follow it back and start  again.\"\n\n\n \"I dunno,\" said Jones. \"Remember  those teeth of theirs. They must  be for biting something more substantial  than moss, Kroger.\"\n\n\n \"We'll risk it,\" said Pat. \"It's better  to go down fighting than to die  of starvation.\"\n\n\n The hell it is. June 24, 1961, for sure The Martians  have coal  mines. That's what they use those  teeth for. We passed through one  and surprised a lot of them chewing  gritty hunks of anthracite out  of the walls. They came running at  us, whistling with those tubelike  tongues, and drooling dry coal dust,  but Pat swung one of his boots in  an arc that splashed all over the  ground in front of them, and they  turned tail (literally) and clattered  off down another tunnel,  sounding like a locomotive whistle  gone berserk.\n\n\n We made the surface in another  hour, back in the canal, and were  lucky enough to find our own trail  to follow toward the place above  which the jeep still waited.\n\n\n Jones got the rifles out of the  stream (the Martians had probably  thought they were beyond recovery  there) and we found the jeep. It  was nearly buried in sand, but we  got it cleaned off and running, and  got back to the ship quickly. First  thing we did on arriving was to  break out the stores and have a  celebration feast just outside the  door of the ship.\n\n\n It was pork again, and I got sick. June 25, 1961 We're going back  . Pat says  that a week is all we were allowed  to stay and that it's urgent to return  and tell what we've learned  about Mars (we know there are  Martians, and they're made of  sugar).\n\n\n \"Why,\" I said, \"can't we just tell  it on the radio?\"\n\n\n \"Because,\" said Pat, \"if we tell  them now, by the time we get back  we'll be yesterday's news. This way  we may be lucky and get a parade.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe even money,\" said  Kroger, whose mind wasn't always  on science.\n\n\n \"But they'll ask why we didn't  radio the info, sir,\" said Jones uneasily.\n\n\n \"The radio,\" said Pat, nodding to  Lloyd, \"was unfortunately broken  shortly after landing.\"\n\n\n Lloyd blinked, then nodded  back and walked around the  rocket. I heard a crunching sound  and the shattering of glass, not unlike  the noise made when one  drives a rifle butt through a radio.\n\n\n Well, it's time for takeoff. This time  it wasn't so bad. I  thought I was getting my space-legs,  but Pat says there's less gravity on  Mars, so escape velocity didn't  have to be so fast, hence a smoother  (relatively) trip on our shock-absorbing  bunks.\n\n\n Lloyd wants to play chess again.  I'll be careful not to win this time.  However, if I don't win, maybe this  time I'll be the one to quit.\n\n\n Kroger is busy in his cramped  lab space trying to classify the little  moss he was able to gather, and  Jones and Pat are up front watching  the white specks revolve on that  black velvet again.\n\n\n Guess I'll take a nap. June 26, 1961 Hell's bells  . Kroger says  there are two baby Martians loose  on board ship. Pat told him he  was nuts, but there are certain  signs he's right. Like the missing  charcoal in the air-filtration-and-reclaiming  (AFAR) system. And  the water gauges are going down.  But the clincher is those two sugar  crystals Lloyd had grabbed up  when we were in that zoo. They're  gone.\n\n\n Pat has declared a state of emergency.  Quick thinking, that's Pat.  Lloyd, before he remembered and  turned scarlet, suggested we radio  Earth for instructions. We can't.\n\n\n Here we are, somewhere in a  void headed for Earth, with enough  air and water left for maybe three  days\u2014if the Martians don't take  any more.\n\n\n Kroger is thrilled that he is  learning something, maybe, about  Martian reproductive processes.  When he told Pat, Pat put it to a  vote whether or not to jettison  Kroger through the airlock. However,  it was decided that responsibility  was pretty well divided.  Lloyd had gotten the crystals,  Kroger had only studied them, and  Jones had brought them aboard.\n\n\n So Kroger stays, but meanwhile  the air is getting worse. Pat suggested  Kroger put us all into a state  of suspended animation till landing  time, eight months away. Kroger  said, \"How?\" June 27, 1961 Air is foul  and I'm very  thirsty. Kroger says that at least\u2014when  the Martians get bigger\u2014they'll  have to show themselves.  Pat says what do we do then ? We  can't afford the water we need to  melt them down. Besides, the  melted crystals might all turn into  little Martians.\n\n\n Jones says he'll go down spitting.\n\n\n Pat says why not dismantle interior  of rocket to find out where  they're holing up? Fine idea.\n\n\n How do you dismantle riveted  metal plates? June 28, 1961 The AFAR system  is no more  and the water gauges are still dropping.  Kroger suggests baking bread,  then slicing it, then toasting it till  it turns to carbon, and we can use  the carbon in the AFAR system.\n\n\n We'll have to try it, I guess. The Martians  ate the bread.  Jones came forward to tell us the  loaves were cooling, and when he  got back they were gone. However,  he did find a few of the red crystals  on the galley deck (floor). They're  good-sized crystals, too. Which  means so are the Martians.\n\n\n Kroger says the Martians must  be intelligent, otherwise they  couldn't have guessed at the carbohydrates  present in the bread after  a lifelong diet of anthracite. Pat  says let's jettison Kroger.\n\n\n This time the vote went against  Kroger, but he got a last-minute reprieve  by suggesting the crystals  be pulverized and mixed with sulphuric  acid. He says this'll produce  carbon.\n\n\n I certainly hope so.\n\n\n So does Kroger. Brief reprieve  for us. The  acid-sugar combination not only  produces carbon but water vapor,  and the gauge has gone up a notch.  That means that we have a quart  of water in the tanks for drinking.  However, the air's a bit better,  and we voted to let Kroger stay inside  the rocket.\n\n\n Meantime, we have to catch  those Martians. June 29, 1961 Worse and worse  . Lloyd  caught one of the Martians in the  firing chamber. We had to flood  the chamber with acid to subdue  the creature, which carbonized  nicely. So now we have plenty of  air and water again, but besides  having another Martian still on  the loose, we now don't have  enough acid left in the fuel tanks  to make a landing.\n\n\n Pat says at least our vector will  carry us to Earth and we can die  on our home planet, which is better  than perishing in space.\n\n\n The hell it is. March 3, 1962 Earth in sight  . The other  Martian is still with us. He's where  we can't get at him without blow-torches,  but he can't get at the carbon  in the AFAR system, either,  which is a help. However, his tail  is prehensile, and now and then it  snakes out through an air duct and  yanks food right off the table from  under our noses.\n\n\n Kroger says watch out. We are  made of carbohydrates, too. I'd  rather not have known. March 4, 1962 Earth fills  the screen in the  control room. Pat says if we're  lucky, he might be able to use the  bit of fuel we have left to set us  in a descending spiral into one of  the oceans. The rocket is tighter  than a submarine, he insists, and  it will float till we're rescued, if  the plates don't crack under the impact.\n\n\n We all agreed to try it. Not that  we thought it had a good chance of  working, but none of us had a better  idea. I guess  you know the rest of  the story, about how that destroyer  spotted us and got us and  my diary aboard, and towed the  rocket to San Francisco. News of  the \"captured Martian\" leaked out,  and we all became nine-day wonders  until the dismantling of the  rocket.\n\n\n Kroger says he must have dissolved  in the water, and wonders  what that would do. There are  about a thousand of those crystal-scales  on a Martian.\n\n\n So last week we found out, when  those red-scaled things began clambering  out of the sea on every coastal  region on Earth. Kroger tried  to explain to me about salinity osmosis  and hydrostatic pressure and  crystalline life, but in no time at all  he lost me.\n\n\n The point is, bullets won't stop  these things, and wherever a crystal  falls, a new Martian springs up  in a few weeks. It looks like the  five of us have abetted an invasion  from Mars.\n\n\n Needless to say, we're no longer  heroes.\n\n\n I haven't heard from Pat or  Lloyd for a week. Jones was picked  up attacking a candy factory yesterday,  and Kroger and I were allowed  to sign on for the flight to  Venus scheduled within the next  few days\u2014because of our experience.\n\n\n Kroger says there's only enough  fuel for a one-way trip. I don't care.  I've always wanted to travel with  the President. \u2014JACK SHARKEY Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Magazine June 1960.

Illustrated by WOOD My  agent was the one who  got me the job of going  along to write up the first  trip to Mars. He was always getting  me things like that\u2014appearances  on TV shows, or mentions in writers'  magazines. If he didn't sell  much of my stuff, at least he sold me .\n\n\n \"It'll be the biggest break a  writer ever got,\" he told me, two  days before blastoff. \"Oh, sure  there'll be scientific reports on the  trip, but the public doesn't want  them; they want the human slant  on things.\"\n\n\n \"But, Louie,\" I said weakly, \"I'll  probably be locked up for the  whole trip. If there are fights or accidents,  they won't tell me about  them.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense,\" said Louie, sipping  carefully at a paper cup of scalding  coffee. \"It'll be just like the  public going along vicariously.  They'll identify with you.\"\n\n\n \"But, Louie,\" I said, wiping the  dampness from my palms on the  knees of my trousers as I sat there,  \"how'll I go about it? A story? An  article? A you-are-there type of report?  What?\"\n\n\n Louie shrugged. \"So keep a  diary. It'll be more intimate, like.\"\n\n\n \"But what if nothing happens?\"  I insisted hopelessly.\n\n\n Louie smiled. \"So you fake it.\"\n\n\n I got up from the chair in his office  and stepped to the door.  \"That's dishonest,\" I pointed out.\n\n\n \"Creative is the word,\" Louie  said.\n\n\n So I went on the first trip to  Mars. And I kept a diary. This is  it. And it is honest. Honest it is. October 1, 1960 They picked  the launching  date from the March, 1959, New  York Times , which stated that this  was the most likely time for launching.  Trip time is supposed to take  260 days (that's one way), so  we're aimed toward where Mars  will be (had better be, or else).\n\n\n There are five of us on board. A  pilot, co-pilot, navigator and biochemist.  And, of course, me. I've  met all but the pilot (he's very  busy today), and they seem friendly  enough.\n\n\n Dwight Kroger, the biochemist,  is rather old to take the \"rigors of  the journey,\" as he puts it, but the  government had a choice between  sending a green scientist who could  stand the trip or an accomplished  man who would probably not survive,  so they picked Kroger. We've  blasted off, though, and he's still  with us. He looks a damn sight better  than I feel. He's kind of balding,  and very iron-gray-haired and  skinny, but his skin is tan as an Indian's,  and right now he's telling  jokes in the washroom with the co-pilot.\n\n\n Jones (that's the co-pilot; I  didn't quite catch his first name) is  scarlet-faced, barrel-chested and  gives the general appearance of belonging  under the spreading chestnut  tree, not in a metal bullet flinging  itself out into airless space.  Come to think of it, who does belong  where we are?\n\n\n The navigator's name is Lloyd  Streeter, but I haven't seen his face  yet. He has a little cubicle behind  the pilot's compartment, with all  kinds of maps and rulers and things.  He keeps bent low over a welded-to-the-wall  (they call it the bulkhead,  for some reason or other)  table, scratching away with a ballpoint  pen on the maps, and now  and then calling numbers over a  microphone to the pilot. His hair  is red and curly, and he looks as  though he'd be tall if he ever gets  to stand up. There are freckles on  the backs of his hands, so I think  he's probably got them on his face,  too. So far, all he's said is, \"Scram,  I'm busy.\"\n\n\n Kroger tells me that the pilot's  name is Patrick Desmond, but that  I can call him Pat when I get to  know him better. So far, he's still  Captain Desmond to me. I haven't  the vaguest idea what he looks like.  He was already on board when I  got here, with my typewriter and  ream of paper, so we didn't meet.\n\n\n My compartment is small but  clean. I mean clean now. It wasn't  during blastoff. The inertial gravities  didn't bother me so much as  the gyroscopic spin they put on the  ship so we have a sort of artificial  gravity to hold us against the  curved floor. It's that constant  whirly feeling that gets me. I get  sick on merry-go-rounds, too.\n\n\n They're having pork for dinner  today. Not me. October 2, 1960 Feeling much  better today.  Kroger gave me a box of Dramamine  pills. He says they'll help my  stomach. So far, so good.\n\n\n Lloyd came by, also. \"You play  chess?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"A little,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"How about a game sometime?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I said. \"Do you have a  board?\"\n\n\n He didn't.\n\n\n Lloyd went away then, but the  interview wasn't wasted. I learned  that he is tall and does have a  freckled face. Maybe we can build  a chessboard. With my paper and  his ballpoint pen and ruler, it should  be easy. Don't know what we'll use  for pieces, though.\n\n\n Jones (I still haven't learned his  first name) has been up with the  pilot all day. He passed my room  on the way to the galley (the  kitchen) for a cup of dark brown  coffee (they like it thick) and told  me that we were almost past the  Moon. I asked to look, but he said  not yet; the instrument panel is  Top Secret. They'd have to cover  it so I could look out the viewing  screen, and they still need it for  steering or something.\n\n\n I still haven't met the pilot. October 3, 1960 Well, I've  met the pilot. He is  kind of squat, with a vulturish neck  and close-set jet-black eyes that  make him look rather mean, but he  was pleasant enough, and said I  could call him Pat. I still don't  know Jones' first name, though Pat  spoke to him, and it sounded like  Flants. That can't be right.\n\n\n Also, I am one of the first five  men in the history of the world to  see the opposite side of the Moon,  with a bluish blurred crescent beyond  it that Pat said was the Earth.  The back of the Moon isn't much  different from the front. As to the  space in front of the ship, well, it's  all black with white dots in it, and  none of the dots move, except in a  circle that Pat says is a \"torque\"  result from the gyroscopic spin  we're in. Actually, he explained to  me, the screen is supposed to keep  the image of space locked into  place no matter how much we spin.  But there's some kind of a \"drag.\"  I told him I hoped it didn't mean  we'd land on Mars upside down. He  just stared at me.\n\n\n I can't say I was too impressed  with that 16 x 19 view of outer  space. It's been done much better  in the movies. There's just no awesomeness  to it, no sense of depth or  immensity. It's as impressive as a  piece of velvet with salt sprinkled  on it.\n\n\n Lloyd and I made a chessboard  out of a carton. Right now we're using  buttons for men. He's one of  these fast players who don't stop  and think out their moves. And so  far I haven't won a game.\n\n\n It looks like a long trip. October 4, 1960 I won  a game. Lloyd mistook my  queen-button for my bishop-button  and left his king in jeopardy, and  I checkmated him next move. He  said chess was a waste of time  and he had important work to do  and he went away.\n\n\n I went to the galley for coffee  and had a talk about moss with  Kroger. He said there was a good  chance of lichen on Mars, and I  misunderstood and said, \"A good  chance of liking what on Mars?\"  and Kroger finished his coffee and  went up front.\n\n\n When I got back to my compartment,  Lloyd had taken away the  chessboard and all his buttons. He  told me later he needed it to back  up a star map.\n\n\n Pat slept mostly all day in his  compartment, and Jones sat and  watched the screen revolve. There  wasn't much to do, so I wrote a  poem, sort of.\n\nMary, Mary, quite contrary,   How does your garden grow?   With Martian rime, Venusian slime,   And a radioactive hoe.  \n\n I showed it to Kroger. He says  it may prove to be environmentally  accurate, but that I should stick to  prose. October 5, 1960 Learned Jones'  first name.  He wrote something in the ship's  log, and I saw his signature. His  name is Fleance, like in \"Macbeth.\"  He prefers to be called Jones. Pat  uses his first name as a gag. Some  fun.\n\n\n And only 255 days to go. April 1, 1961 I've skipped  over the last 177  days or so, because there's nothing  much new. I brought some books  with me on the trip, books that I'd  always meant to read and never  had the time. So now I know all  about Vanity Fair , Pride and Prejudice , War and Peace , Gone with  the Wind , and Babbitt .\n\n\n They didn't take as long as I  thought they would, except for Vanity Fair . It must have been a  riot when it first came out. I mean,  all those sly digs at the aristocracy,  with copious interpolations by Mr.  Thackeray in case you didn't get  it when he'd pulled a particularly  good gag. Some fun.\n\n\n And only 78 days to go. June 1, 1961 Only 17 days  to go. I saw Mars  on the screen today. It seems to be  descending from overhead, but Pat  says that that's the \"torque\" doing  it. Actually, it's we who are coming  in sideways.\n\n\n We've all grown beards, too. Pat  said it was against regulations, but  what the hell. We have a contest.  Longest whiskers on landing gets a  prize.\n\n\n I asked Pat what the prize was  and he told me to go to hell. June 18, 1961 Mars has  the whole screen  filled. Looks like Death Valley. No  sign of canals, but Pat says that's  because of the dust storm down below.  It's nice to have a \"down below\"  again. We're going to land, so  I have to go to my bunk. It's all  foam rubber, nylon braid supports  and magnesium tubing. Might as  well be cement for all the good it  did me at takeoff. Earth seems awfully  far away. June 19, 1961 Well, we're down.  We have  to wear gas masks with oxygen  hook-ups. Kroger says the air is  breathable, but thin, and it has too  much dust in it to be any fun to  inhale. He's all for going out and  looking for lichen, but Pat says he's  got to set up camp, then get instructions  from Earth. So we just have  to wait. The air is very cold, but the  Sun is hot as hell when it hits you.  The sky is a blinding pink, or maybe  more of a pale fuchsia. Kroger  says it's the dust. The sand underfoot  is kind of rose-colored, and not  really gritty. The particles are  round and smooth.\n\n\n No lichen so far. Kroger says  maybe in the canals, if there are  any canals. Lloyd wants to play  chess again.\n\n\n Jones won the beard contest. Pat  gave him a cigar he'd smuggled on  board (no smoking was allowed on  the ship), and Jones threw it away.  He doesn't smoke. June 20, 1961 Got lost today.  Pat told me  not to go too far from camp, so,  when I took a stroll, I made sure  every so often that I could still see  the rocket behind me. Walked for  maybe an hour; then the oxygen  gauge got past the halfway mark,  so I started back toward the rocket.  After maybe ten steps, the rocket  disappeared. One minute it was  standing there, tall and silvery, the  next instant it was gone.\n\n\n Turned on my radio pack and  got hold of Pat. Told him what happened,  and he told Kroger. Kroger  said I had been following a mirage,  to step back a bit. I did, and I could  see the ship again. Kroger said to  try and walk toward where the ship  seemed to be, even when it wasn't  in view, and meantime they'd come  out after me in the jeep, following  my footprints.\n\n\n Started walking back, and the  ship vanished again. It reappeared,  disappeared, but I kept going. Finally  saw the real ship, and Lloyd  and Jones waving their arms at me.  They were shouting through their  masks, but I couldn't hear them.  The air is too thin to carry sound  well.\n\n\n All at once, something gleamed  in their hands, and they started  shooting at me with their rifles.  That's when I heard the noise behind  me. I was too scared to turn  around, but finally Jones and Lloyd  came running over, and I got up  enough nerve to look. There was  nothing there, but on the sand,  paralleling mine, were footprints.  At least I think they were footprints.  Twice as long as mine, and  three times as wide, but kind of  featureless because the sand's loose  and dry. They doubled back on  themselves, spaced considerably  farther apart.\n\n\n \"What was it?\" I asked Lloyd  when he got to me.\n\n\n \"Damned if I know,\" he said. \"It  was red and scaly, and I think it  had a tail. It was two heads taller  than you.\" He shuddered. \"Ran off  when we fired.\"\n\n\n \"Where,\" said Jones, \"are Pat and  Kroger?\"\n\n\n I didn't know. I hadn't seen  them, nor the jeep, on my trip back.  So we followed the wheel tracks for  a while, and they veered off from  my trail and followed another, very  much like the one that had been  paralleling mine when Jones and  Lloyd had taken a shot at the scaly  thing.\n\n\n \"We'd better get them on the  radio,\" said Jones, turning back  toward the ship.\n\n\n There wasn't anything on the  radio but static.\n\n\n Pat and Kroger haven't come  back yet, either. June 21, 1961 We're not  alone here. More of  the scaly things have come toward  the camp, but a few rifle shots send  them away. They hop like kangaroos  when they're startled. Their  attitudes aren't menacing, but their  appearance is. And Jones says,  \"Who knows what's 'menacing' in  an alien?\"\n\n\n We're going to look for Kroger  and Pat today. Jones says we'd better  before another windstorm blows  away the jeep tracks. Fortunately,  the jeep has a leaky oil pan, so we  always have the smears to follow,  unless they get covered up, too.  We're taking extra oxygen, shells,  and rifles. Food, too, of course.  And we're locking up the ship. It's later  , now. We found the  jeep, but no Kroger or Pat. Lots of  those big tracks nearby. We're taking  the jeep to follow the aliens'  tracks. There's some moss around  here, on reddish brown rocks that  stick up through the sand, just on  the shady side, though. Kroger  must be happy to have found his  lichen.\n\n\n The trail ended at the brink of  a deep crevice in the ground. Seems  to be an earthquake-type split in  solid rock, with the sand sifting  over this and the far edge like pink  silk cataracts. The bottom is in the  shade and can't be seen. The crack  seems to extend to our left and  right as far as we can look.\n\n\n There looks like a trail down the  inside of the crevice, but the Sun's  setting, so we're waiting till tomorrow  to go down.\n\n\n Going down was Jones' idea,  not mine. June 22, 1961 Well, we're  at the bottom, and  there's water here, a shallow stream  about thirty feet wide that runs  along the center of the canal (we've  decided we're in a canal). No sign  of Pat or Kroger yet, but the sand  here is hard-packed and damp, and  there are normal-size footprints  mingled with the alien ones, sharp  and clear. The aliens seem to have  six or seven toes. It varies from  print to print. And they're barefoot,  too, or else they have the damnedest-looking  shoes in creation.\n\n\n The constant shower of sand  near the cliff walls is annoying, but  it's sandless (shower-wise) near  the stream, so we're following the  footprints along the bank. Also, the  air's better down here. Still thin,  but not so bad as on the surface.  We're going without masks to save  oxygen for the return trip (Jones  assures me there'll be a return  trip), and the air's only a little bit  sandy, but handkerchiefs over nose  and mouth solve this.\n\n\n We look like desperadoes, what  with the rifles and covered faces. I  said as much to Lloyd and he told  me to shut up. Moss all over the  cliff walls. Swell luck for Kroger. We've found  Kroger and Pat,  with the help of the aliens. Or maybe  I should call them the Martians.  Either way, it's better than what  Jones calls them.\n\n\n They took away our rifles and  brought us right to Kroger and Pat,  without our even asking. Jones is  mad at the way they got the rifles so  easily. When we came upon them  (a group of maybe ten, huddling  behind a boulder in ambush), he  fired, but the shots either bounced  off their scales or stuck in their  thick hides. Anyway, they took the  rifles away and threw them into the  stream, and picked us all up and  took us into a hole in the cliff wall.  The hole went on practically forever,  but it didn't get dark. Kroger  tells me that there are phosphorescent  bacteria living in the mold on  the walls. The air has a fresh-dug-grave  smell, but it's richer in oxygen  than even at the stream.\n\n\n We're in a small cave that is just  off a bigger cave where lots of tunnels  come together. I can't remember  which one we came in through,  and neither can anyone else. Jones  asked me what the hell I kept writing  in the diary for, did I want to  make it a gift to Martian archeologists?  But I said where there's life  there's hope, and now he won't talk  to me. I congratulated Kroger on  the lichen I'd seen, but he just said  a short and unscientific word and  went to sleep.\n\n\n There's a Martian guarding the  entrance to our cave. I don't know  what they intend to do with us.  Feed us, I hope. So far, they've just  left us here, and we're out of rations.\n\n\n Kroger tried talking to the guard  once, but he (or it) made a whistling  kind of sound and flashed a  mouthful of teeth. Kroger says the  teeth are in multiple rows, like a  tiger shark's. I'd rather he hadn't  told me. June 23, 1961, I think We're either  in a docket or a  zoo. I can't tell which. There's a  rather square platform surrounded  on all four sides by running water,  maybe twenty feet across, and  we're on it. Martians keep coming  to the far edge of the water and  looking at us and whistling at each  other. A little Martian came near  the edge of the water and a larger  Martian whistled like crazy and  dragged it away.\n\n\n \"Water must be dangerous to  them,\" said Kroger.\n\n\n \"We shoulda brought water pistols,\"  Jones muttered.\n\n\n Pat said maybe we can swim to  safety. Kroger told Pat he was  crazy, that the little island we're on  here underground is bordered by a  fast river that goes into the planet.  We'd end up drowned in some grotto  in the heart of the planet, says  Kroger.\n\n\n \"What the hell,\" says Pat, \"it's  better than starving.\"\n\n\n It is not. June 24, 1961, probably I'm hungry  . So is everybody  else. Right now I could eat a dinner  raw, in a centrifuge, and keep it  down. A Martian threw a stone at  Jones today, and Jones threw one  back at him and broke off a couple  of scales. The Martian whistled  furiously and went away. When the  crowd thinned out, same as it did  yesterday (must be some sort of  sleeping cycle here), Kroger talked  Lloyd into swimming across the  river and getting the red scales.  Lloyd started at the upstream part  of the current, and was about a hundred  yards below this underground  island before he made the far side.  Sure is a swift current.\n\n\n But he got the scales, walked  very far upstream of us, and swam  back with them. The stream sides  are steep, like in a fjord, and we  had to lift him out of the swirling  cold water, with the scales gripped  in his fist. Or what was left of the  scales. They had melted down in  the water and left his hand all  sticky.\n\n\n Kroger took the gummy things,  studied them in the uncertain light,  then tasted them and grinned.\n\n\n The Martians are made of sugar. Later, same day  . Kroger  said that the Martian metabolism  must be like Terran (Earth-type)  metabolism, only with no pancreas  to make insulin. They store their  energy on the outside of their  bodies, in the form of scales. He's  watched them more closely and  seen that they have long rubbery  tubes for tongues, and that they  now and then suck up water from  the stream while they're watching  us, being careful not to get their lips  (all sugar, of course) wet. He  guesses that their \"blood\" must be  almost pure water, and that it  washes away (from the inside, of  course) the sugar they need for  energy.\n\n\n I asked him where the sugar  came from, and he said probably  their bodies isolated carbon from  something (he thought it might be  the moss) and combined it with  the hydrogen and oxygen in the  water (even I knew the formula for  water) to make sugar, a common  carbohydrate.\n\n\n Like plants, on Earth, he said.  Except, instead of using special  cells on leaves to form carbohydrates  with the help of sunpower,  as Earth plants do in photosynthesis  (Kroger spelled that word  for me), they used the shape of the  scales like prisms, to isolate the  spectra (another Kroger word)  necessary to form the sugar.\n\n\n \"I don't get it,\" I said politely,  when he'd finished his spiel.\n\n\n \"Simple,\" he said, as though he  were addressing me by name.  \"They have a twofold reason to fear  water. One: by complete solvency  in that medium, they lose all energy  and die. Two: even partial sprinkling  alters the shape of the scales,  and they are unable to use sunpower  to form more sugar, and still die,  if a bit slower.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said, taking it down verbatim.  \"So now what do we do?\"\n\n\n \"We remove our boots,\" said  Kroger, sitting on the ground and  doing so, \"and then we cross this  stream, fill the boots with water,  and spray our way to freedom.\"\n\n\n \"Which tunnel do we take?\"  asked Pat, his eyes aglow at the  thought of escape.\n\n\n Kroger shrugged. \"We'll have to  chance taking any that seem to  slope upward. In any event, we can  always follow it back and start  again.\"\n\n\n \"I dunno,\" said Jones. \"Remember  those teeth of theirs. They must  be for biting something more substantial  than moss, Kroger.\"\n\n\n \"We'll risk it,\" said Pat. \"It's better  to go down fighting than to die  of starvation.\"\n\n\n The hell it is. June 24, 1961, for sure The Martians  have coal  mines. That's what they use those  teeth for. We passed through one  and surprised a lot of them chewing  gritty hunks of anthracite out  of the walls. They came running at  us, whistling with those tubelike  tongues, and drooling dry coal dust,  but Pat swung one of his boots in  an arc that splashed all over the  ground in front of them, and they  turned tail (literally) and clattered  off down another tunnel,  sounding like a locomotive whistle  gone berserk.\n\n\n We made the surface in another  hour, back in the canal, and were  lucky enough to find our own trail  to follow toward the place above  which the jeep still waited.\n\n\n Jones got the rifles out of the  stream (the Martians had probably  thought they were beyond recovery  there) and we found the jeep. It  was nearly buried in sand, but we  got it cleaned off and running, and  got back to the ship quickly. First  thing we did on arriving was to  break out the stores and have a  celebration feast just outside the  door of the ship.\n\n\n It was pork again, and I got sick. June 25, 1961 We're going back  . Pat says  that a week is all we were allowed  to stay and that it's urgent to return  and tell what we've learned  about Mars (we know there are  Martians, and they're made of  sugar).\n\n\n \"Why,\" I said, \"can't we just tell  it on the radio?\"\n\n\n \"Because,\" said Pat, \"if we tell  them now, by the time we get back  we'll be yesterday's news. This way  we may be lucky and get a parade.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe even money,\" said  Kroger, whose mind wasn't always  on science.\n\n\n \"But they'll ask why we didn't  radio the info, sir,\" said Jones uneasily.\n\n\n \"The radio,\" said Pat, nodding to  Lloyd, \"was unfortunately broken  shortly after landing.\"\n\n\n Lloyd blinked, then nodded  back and walked around the  rocket. I heard a crunching sound  and the shattering of glass, not unlike  the noise made when one  drives a rifle butt through a radio.\n\n\n Well, it's time for takeoff. This time  it wasn't so bad. I  thought I was getting my space-legs,  but Pat says there's less gravity on  Mars, so escape velocity didn't  have to be so fast, hence a smoother  (relatively) trip on our shock-absorbing  bunks.\n\n\n Lloyd wants to play chess again.  I'll be careful not to win this time.  However, if I don't win, maybe this  time I'll be the one to quit.\n\n\n Kroger is busy in his cramped  lab space trying to classify the little  moss he was able to gather, and  Jones and Pat are up front watching  the white specks revolve on that  black velvet again.\n\n\n Guess I'll take a nap. June 26, 1961 Hell's bells  . Kroger says  there are two baby Martians loose  on board ship. Pat told him he  was nuts, but there are certain  signs he's right. Like the missing  charcoal in the air-filtration-and-reclaiming  (AFAR) system. And  the water gauges are going down.  But the clincher is those two sugar  crystals Lloyd had grabbed up  when we were in that zoo. They're  gone.\n\n\n Pat has declared a state of emergency.  Quick thinking, that's Pat.  Lloyd, before he remembered and  turned scarlet, suggested we radio  Earth for instructions. We can't.\n\n\n Here we are, somewhere in a  void headed for Earth, with enough  air and water left for maybe three  days\u2014if the Martians don't take  any more.\n\n\n Kroger is thrilled that he is  learning something, maybe, about  Martian reproductive processes.  When he told Pat, Pat put it to a  vote whether or not to jettison  Kroger through the airlock. However,  it was decided that responsibility  was pretty well divided.  Lloyd had gotten the crystals,  Kroger had only studied them, and  Jones had brought them aboard.\n\n\n So Kroger stays, but meanwhile  the air is getting worse. Pat suggested  Kroger put us all into a state  of suspended animation till landing  time, eight months away. Kroger  said, \"How?\" June 27, 1961 Air is foul  and I'm very  thirsty. Kroger says that at least\u2014when  the Martians get bigger\u2014they'll  have to show themselves.  Pat says what do we do then ? We  can't afford the water we need to  melt them down. Besides, the  melted crystals might all turn into  little Martians.\n\n\n Jones says he'll go down spitting.\n\n\n Pat says why not dismantle interior  of rocket to find out where  they're holing up? Fine idea.\n\n\n How do you dismantle riveted  metal plates? June 28, 1961 The AFAR system  is no more  and the water gauges are still dropping.  Kroger suggests baking bread,  then slicing it, then toasting it till  it turns to carbon, and we can use  the carbon in the AFAR system.\n\n\n We'll have to try it, I guess. The Martians  ate the bread.  Jones came forward to tell us the  loaves were cooling, and when he  got back they were gone. However,  he did find a few of the red crystals  on the galley deck (floor). They're  good-sized crystals, too. Which  means so are the Martians.\n\n\n Kroger says the Martians must  be intelligent, otherwise they  couldn't have guessed at the carbohydrates  present in the bread after  a lifelong diet of anthracite. Pat  says let's jettison Kroger.\n\n\n This time the vote went against  Kroger, but he got a last-minute reprieve  by suggesting the crystals  be pulverized and mixed with sulphuric  acid. He says this'll produce  carbon.\n\n\n I certainly hope so.\n\n\n So does Kroger. Brief reprieve  for us. The  acid-sugar combination not only  produces carbon but water vapor,  and the gauge has gone up a notch.  That means that we have a quart  of water in the tanks for drinking.  However, the air's a bit better,  and we voted to let Kroger stay inside  the rocket.\n\n\n Meantime, we have to catch  those Martians. June 29, 1961 Worse and worse  . Lloyd  caught one of the Martians in the  firing chamber. We had to flood  the chamber with acid to subdue  the creature, which carbonized  nicely. So now we have plenty of  air and water again, but besides  having another Martian still on  the loose, we now don't have  enough acid left in the fuel tanks  to make a landing.\n\n\n Pat says at least our vector will  carry us to Earth and we can die  on our home planet, which is better  than perishing in space.\n\n\n The hell it is. March 3, 1962 Earth in sight  . The other  Martian is still with us. He's where  we can't get at him without blow-torches,  but he can't get at the carbon  in the AFAR system, either,  which is a help. However, his tail  is prehensile, and now and then it  snakes out through an air duct and  yanks food right off the table from  under our noses.\n\n\n Kroger says watch out. We are  made of carbohydrates, too. I'd  rather not have known. March 4, 1962 Earth fills  the screen in the  control room. Pat says if we're  lucky, he might be able to use the  bit of fuel we have left to set us  in a descending spiral into one of  the oceans. The rocket is tighter  than a submarine, he insists, and  it will float till we're rescued, if  the plates don't crack under the impact.\n\n\n We all agreed to try it. Not that  we thought it had a good chance of  working, but none of us had a better  idea. I guess  you know the rest of  the story, about how that destroyer  spotted us and got us and  my diary aboard, and towed the  rocket to San Francisco. News of  the \"captured Martian\" leaked out,  and we all became nine-day wonders  until the dismantling of the  rocket.\n\n\n Kroger says he must have dissolved  in the water, and wonders  what that would do. There are  about a thousand of those crystal-scales  on a Martian.\n\n\n So last week we found out, when  those red-scaled things began clambering  out of the sea on every coastal  region on Earth. Kroger tried  to explain to me about salinity osmosis  and hydrostatic pressure and  crystalline life, but in no time at all  he lost me.\n\n\n The point is, bullets won't stop  these things, and wherever a crystal  falls, a new Martian springs up  in a few weeks. It looks like the  five of us have abetted an invasion  from Mars.\n\n\n Needless to say, we're no longer  heroes.\n\n\n I haven't heard from Pat or  Lloyd for a week. Jones was picked  up attacking a candy factory yesterday,  and Kroger and I were allowed  to sign on for the flight to  Venus scheduled within the next  few days\u2014because of our experience.\n\n\n Kroger says there's only enough  fuel for a one-way trip. I don't care.  I've always wanted to travel with  the President. \u2014JACK SHARKEY Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Magazine June 1960.
