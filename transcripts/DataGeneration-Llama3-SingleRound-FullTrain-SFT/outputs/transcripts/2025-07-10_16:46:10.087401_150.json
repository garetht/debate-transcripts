But they erred in thinking\n\n the Old Ones were too big to be clever.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1949.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] In the last hours the star ahead had grown brighter by many magnitudes,  and had changed its color from a dazzling blue through white to the  normal yellow, of a GO sun. That was the Doppler effect as the star's  radial velocity changed relative to the Quest III , as for forty hours  the ship had decelerated.\n\n\n They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glittering  backdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the Quest  III drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed of  light, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifeless  luminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell. They had grown  sated with the sight of wonders\u2014of multiple systems of giant stars, of  nebulae that sprawled in empty flame across light years.\n\n\n But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the Quest III's crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, they  came and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showed  the oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been born  in the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in low  voices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what might  lie at the long journey's end. For the Quest III was coming home; the  sun ahead was the Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning. Knof Llud, the Quest III's captain, came slowly down the narrow  stair from the observatory, into the big rotunda that was now the main  recreation room, where most of the people gathered. The great chamber,  a full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At  the voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot  cylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were  spent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread  out from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was  little more than a hollow shell.\n\n\n Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met  them with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, \"We've  sighted Earth.\"\n\n\n A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,  \"It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has  identified it\u2014no more.\"\n\n\n But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round  the screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could  pick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung  each other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears  were forgotten and exaltation prevailed.\n\n\n Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about  to make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.\n\n\n He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at  his elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, \"How do you feel,  Lesra?\"\n\n\n She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. \"I don't  know. It's good that Earth's still there.\" She was thinking, he judged  shrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not  remember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....\n\n\n He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, \"What did you think might  have happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.\"\n\n\n \"That's just it,\" said Lesra shakily. \"Nine hundred years have gone  by\u2014 there \u2014and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world  we left, the world we knew and fitted in....\"\n\n\n The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. \"Don't  worry. Things may have changed\u2014but we'll manage.\" But his face had  hardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear  within him. He let his arm fall. \"I'd better get up to the bridge.  There's a new course to be set now\u2014for Earth.\"\n\n\n He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched  off the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the  people saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own  Sun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes  gleamed with unshed tears.\n\n\n Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat  that ate the canary. Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed  positions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with  his extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had  already set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to  Earth.\n\n\n Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, \"Probably we'll be intercepted  before we get that far.\"\n\n\n Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. \"Uh, Captain,\" he said  hesitantly. \"What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?\"\n\n\n Llud shook his head slowly. \"Who knows? We don't know whether any  of the other Quests returned successful, or if they returned at  all. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth. It's  possible\u2014not likely, though\u2014that something has happened to break  civilization's continuity to the point where our expedition has been  forgotten altogether.\" He turned away grim-lipped and left the bridge. From his private  office-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to  notify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he  sat idle, alone with his thoughts.\n\n\n The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud  found himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for  everyone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.\n\n\n There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but  he couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down  and watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find  Lesra and the children\u2014but somehow he didn't want to do that either.\n\n\n He felt empty, drained\u2014like his ship. As the Quest III's fuel stores  and the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the  strength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost  empty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n\n\n Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred  Earth years\u2014though physically he was only forty now, ten years older  than when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the  time axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and  months had passed for the Quest III in interstellar flight while  years and decades had raced by on the home world.\n\n\n Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with  built-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about  three dozen film spools there\u2014his personal memoirs of the great  expedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to  the ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a  report to whatever powers might be on Earth now\u2014if such powers were  still interested.\n\n\n Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made  shortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He  slid it onto the reproducer.\n\n\n His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and  confident than he knew it was now.\n\n\n \"One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time  since leaving Earth.\n\n\n \"Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice  the size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n\n\n \"Our hopes were dashed\u2014and I think all of us, even remembering the  Centaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If  Procyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after  an absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n\n\n \"It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go  on to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success  comes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;  friends, relatives, all the generation that launched the Quest ships  will be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,  humanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....\"\n\n\n Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned  back, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed  remote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still  have been ringing in his ears.\n\n\n He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,  later, one.\n\n\n \"One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that  that system, too, is devoid of planets.\n\n\n \"We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably  true\u2014that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we  may complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n\n\n \"It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....  This may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to  one world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship  and its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and  energy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and  exhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless  and transcendent effort\u2014the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,  or the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the  twentieth century.\n\n\n \"Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are  the result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and  therefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be  limited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is  life.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was  in sight\u2014so we launched the Quests . Perhaps our effort will prove as  futile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to  reduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport  very many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into  its decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,  expanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n\n\n \"Hopeless, unless we find planets!\" Knof Llud shook his head sorrowfully and took off the spool. That  was from the time when he had grown philosophical after the first  disappointments.\n\n\n He frowned thoughtfully, choosing one more spool that was only four  years old. The recorded voice sounded weary, yet alive with a strange  longing....\n\n\n \"We are in the heart of Pleiades; a hundred stars show brilliant on  the screens, each star encircled by a misty halo like lights glowing  through fog, for we are traversing a vast diffuse nebula.\n\n\n \"According to plan, the Quest III has reached its furthest point from  Earth. Now we turn back along a curve that will take us past many more  stars and stellar systems\u2014but hope is small that any of those will  prove a home for man, as have none of the thousands of stars examined  already.\n\n\n \"But what are a few thousand stars in a galaxy of billions? We have  only, as it were, visited a handful of the outlying villages of the  Universe, while the lights of its great cities still blaze far ahead  along the Milky Way.\n\n\n \"On flimsy excuses I have had Zost Relyul make observations of the  globular cluster Omega Centauri. There are a hundred thousand stars  there in a volume of space where one finds a few dozen in the Sun's  neighborhood; there if anywhere must circle the planets we seek! But  Omega Centauri is twenty thousand light years away....\n\n\n \"Even so\u2014by expending its remaining fuel freely, the Quest III could  achieve a velocity that would take us there without dying of senility  of aging too greatly. It would be a one-way journey\u2014even if enough  fuel remained, there would be little point in returning to Earth after  more than forty thousand years. By then our civilization certainly, and  perhaps the human race itself, would have perished from memory.\n\n\n \"That was why the planners limited our voyage, and those of the other Quests , to less than a thousand years Earth time. Even now, according  to the sociodynamic predictions made then, our civilization\u2014if the  other expeditions failed also\u2014will have reached a dangerously unstable  phase, and before we can get back it may have collapsed completely from  overpopulation.\n\n\n \"Why go back, then with the news of our failure? Why not forget about  Earth and go on to Omega Centauri? What use is quixotic loyalty to a  decree five thousand years old, whose makers are dead and which may be  forgotten back there?\n\n\n \"Would the crew be willing? I don't know\u2014some of them still show signs  of homesickness, though they know with their minds that everything that  was once 'home' has probably been swept away....\n\n\n \"It doesn't matter. Today I gave orders to swing the ship.\"\n\n\n Savagely Knof Llud stabbed the button that shut off the speaker. Then  he sat for a time with head resting in his hands, staring into nothing.\n\n\n The memory of that fierce impulse to go on still had power to shake  him. A couple of lines of poetry came into his head, as he read them  once in translation from the ancient English.... ... for my purpose holds To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths Of all the western stars, until I die. Llud sighed. He still couldn't say just why he had given the order to  turn back. The stars had claimed his heart\u2014but he was still a part of  Earth, and not even nine hundred years of space and time had been able  to alter that.\n\n\n He wondered if there would still be a quiet stream and a green  shady place beside it where a death-weary man, relieved at last of  responsibility, could rest and dream no more.... Those things went  on, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young  Knof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the  glittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he  would want to do that, though.\n\n\n Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed  to falter one moment in flight. The captain was on his feet instantly, but then his movements became  unhurried. Whatever it had been was past, and he had a good idea  what it had been\u2014a meteoroid, nothing unusual in the vicinity of  the Sun, though in interstellar space and around planetless stars  such collisions were rare to the vanishing point. No harm could have  been done. The Quest III's collision armor was nonmaterial and for  practical purposes invulnerable.\n\n\n Just as he took his finger off the button that opened the door, the  intercommunication phone shrilled imperatively. Knof Llud wheeled,  frowning\u2014surely a meteoroid impact wasn't that serious. Coincidence,  maybe\u2014it might be Zost Relyul calling as instructed.\n\n\n He reached the phone at the moment when another, heavier jolt shook  the vessel. Llud snatched up the receiver with the speed of a scalded  cat.\n\n\n \"Captain?\" It was Gwar Den's voice, stammering a little. \"Captain,  we're being attacked!\"\n\n\n \"Sound the alarm. Emergency stations.\" He had said it automatically,  then felt a curious detached relief at the knowledge that after all  these years he could still respond quickly and smoothly to a crisis.  There was a moment's silence, and he heard the alarm start\u2014three  short buzzes and repeat, ringing through all the great length of the  interstellar ship. Knowing that Gwar Den was still there, he said,  \"Now\u2014attacked by what?\"\n\n\n \"Ships,\" said Gwar Den helplessly. \"Five of them so far. No, there's a  sixth now.\" Repeated blows quivered the Quest III's framework. The  navigator said, obviously striving for calm, \"They're light craft, not  fifty feet long, but they move fast. The detectors hardly had time to  show them before they opened up. Can't get a telescope beam on them  long enough to tell much.\"\n\n\n \"If they're that small,\" said Knof Llud deliberately, \"they can't carry  anything heavy enough to hurt us. Hold to course. I'll be right up.\"\n\n\n In the open doorway he almost fell over his son. Young Knof's eyes were  big; he had heard his father's words.\n\n\n \"Something's happened,\" he judged with deadly twelve-year-old  seriousness and, without wasting time on questions, \"Can I go with you,  huh, Dad?\"\n\n\n Llud hesitated, said, \"All right. Come along and keep out of the way.\"  He headed for the bridge with strides that the boy could not match.\n\n\n There were people running in the corridors, heading for their posts.  Their faces were set, scared, uncomprehending. The Quest III shuddered, again and again, under blows that must have had millions  of horsepower behind them; but it plunged on toward Earth, its mighty  engines still steadily braking its interstellar velocity.\n\n\n To a man, the ship's responsible officers were already on the bridge,  most of them breathless. To a man they looked appeal at Captain Knof  Llud.\n\n\n \"Well?\" he snapped. \"What are they doing?\"\n\n\n Gwar Den spoke. \"There are thirteen of them out there now, sir, and  they're all banging away at us.\"\n\n\n The captain stared into the black star-strewn depths of a vision screen  where occasional blue points of light winked ominously, never twice  from the same position.\n\n\n Knof Jr. flattened himself against the metal wall and watched silently.  His young face was less anxious than his elders'; he had confidence in  his father.\n\n\n \"If they had anything heavier,\" surmised the captain, \"they'd have  unlimbered it by now. They're out to get us. But at this rate, they  can't touch us as long as our power lasts\u2014or until they bring up some  bigger stuff.\" The mild shocks went on\u2014whether from projectiles or energy-charges,  would be hard to find out and it didn't matter; whatever was hitting  the Quest III's shell was doing it at velocities where the  distinction between matter and radiation practically ceases to exist.\n\n\n But that shell was tough. It was an extension of the gravitic drive  field which transmitted the engines' power equally to every atom of  the ship; forces impinging on the outside of the field were similarly  transmitted and rendered harmless. The effect was as if the vessel and  all space inside its field were a single perfectly elastic body. A  meteoroid, for example, on striking it rebounded\u2014usually vaporized by  the impact\u2014and the ship, in obedience to the law of equal and opposite  forces, rebounded too, but since its mass was so much greater, its  deflection was negligible.\n\n\n The people in the Quest III would have felt nothing at all of  the vicious onslaught being hurled against them, save that their  inertialess drive, at its normal thrust of two hundred gravities,  was intentionally operated at one half of one per cent efficiency to  provide the illusion of Earthly gravitation.\n\n\n One of the officers said shakily, \"It's as if they've been lying in  wait for us. But why on Earth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That,\" said the captain grimly, \"is what we have to find out. Why\u2014on  Earth. At least, I suspect the answer's there.\"\n\n\n The Quest III bored steadily on through space, decelerating. Even if  one were no fatalist, there seemed no reason to stop decelerating or  change course. There was nowhere else to go and too little fuel left  if there had been; come what might, this was journey's end\u2014perhaps  in a more violent and final way than had been anticipated. All around  wheeled the pigmy enemies, circling, maneuvering, and attacking,  always attacking, with the senseless fury of maddened hornets. The  interstellar ship bore no offensive weapons\u2014but suddenly on one of the  vision screens a speck of light flared into nova-brilliance, dazzling  the watchers for the brief moment in which its very atoms were torn  apart.\n\n\n Knof Jr. whooped ecstatically and then subsided warily, but no one was  paying attention to him. The men on the Quest III's bridge looked  questions at each other, as the thought of help from outside flashed  into many minds at once. But Captain Llud said soberly, \"It must have  caught one of their own shots, reflected. Maybe its own, if it scored  too direct a hit.\"\n\n\n He studied the data so far gathered. A few blurred pictures had been  got, which showed cylindrical space ships much like the Quest III ,  except that they were rocket-propelled and of far lesser size. Their  size was hard to ascertain, because you needed to know their distance  and speed\u2014but detector-beam echoes gave the distance, and likewise, by  the Doppler method, the velocity of directly receding or approaching  ships. It was apparent that the enemy vessels were even smaller than  Gwar Den had at first supposed\u2014not large enough to hold even one man.  Tiny, deadly hornets with a colossal sting.\n\n\n \"Robot craft, no doubt,\" said Knof Llud, but a chill ran down his spine  as it occurred to him that perhaps the attackers weren't of human  origin. They had seen no recognizable life in the part of the galaxy  they had explored, but one of the other Quests might have encountered  and been traced home by some unhuman race that was greedy and able to  conquer. It became evident, too, that the bombardment was being kept up by a  constant arrival of fresh attackers, while others raced away into  space, presumably returning to base to replenish their ammunition. That  argued a planned and prepared interception with virulent hatred behind  it.\n\n\n Elsuz Llug, the gravitic engineer, calculated dismally, \"At the rate  we're having to shed energy, the fuel will be gone in six or eight  hours.\"\n\n\n \"We'll have reached Earth before then,\" Gwar Den said hopefully.\n\n\n \"If they don't bring out the heavy artillery first.\"\n\n\n \"We're under the psychological disadvantage,\" said the captain, \"of not  knowing why we're being attacked.\"\n\n\n Knof Jr. burst out, spluttering slightly with the violence of a  thought too important to suppress, \"But we're under a ps-psychological  advantage, too!\"\n\n\n His father raised an eyebrow. \"What's that? I don't seem to have  noticed it.\"\n\n\n \"They're mad and we aren't, yet,\" said the boy. Then, seeing that he  hadn't made himself clear, \"In a fight, if a guy gets mad he starts  swinging wild and then you nail him.\"\n\n\n Smiles splintered the ice of tension. Captain Llud said, \"Maybe you've  got something there. They seem to be mad, all right. But we're not in  a position to throw any punches.\" He turned back to the others. \"As I  was going to say\u2014I think we'd better try to parley with the enemy. At  least we may find out who he is and why he's determined to smash us.\"\n\n\n And now instead of tight-beam detectors the ship was broadcasting on an  audio carrier wave that shifted through a wide range of frequencies,  repeating on each the same brief recorded message:\n\n\n \"Who are you? What do you want? We are the interstellar expedition Quest III ....\" And so on, identifying themselves and protesting that  they were unarmed and peaceful, that there must be some mistake, and  querying again, \"Who are you ?\"\n\n\n There was no answer. The ship drove on, its fuel trickling away under  multiplied demands. Those outside were squandering vastly greater  amounts of energy in the effort to batter down its defenses, but  converting that energy into harmless gravitic impulses was costing the Quest III too. Once more Knof Llud had the insidious sense of his own  nerves and muscles and will weakening along with the power-sinews of  his ship.\n\n\n Zost Relyul approached him apologetically. \"If you have time,  Captain\u2014I've got some data on Earth now.\"\n\n\n Eagerly Llud took the sheaf of photographs made with the telescope. But  they told him nothing; only the continental outlines were clear, and  those were as they had been nine hundred years ago.... He looked up  inquiringly at Zost Relyul.\n\n\n \"There are some strange features,\" said the astronomer carefully.  \"First of all\u2014there are no lights on the night side. And on the  daylight face, our highest magnification should already reveal traces  of cities, canals, and the like\u2014but it does not.\n\n\n \"The prevailing color of the land masses, you see, is the normal  green vegetation. But the diffraction spectrum is queer. It indicates  reflecting surfaces less than one-tenth millimeter wide\u2014so the  vegetation there can't be trees or grass, but must be more like a fine  moss or even a coarse mold.\"\n\n\n \"Is that all?\" demanded Llud.\n\n\n \"Isn't it enough?\" said Zost Relyul blankly. \"Well\u2014we tried  photography by invisible light, of course. The infra-red shows nothing  and likewise the ultraviolet up to the point where the atmosphere is  opaque to it.\"\n\n\n The captain sighed wearily. \"Good work,\" he said. \"Keep it up; perhaps  you can answer some of these riddles before\u2014\"\n\n\n \" We know who you are ,\" interrupted a harshly crackling voice with a  strange accent, \" and pleading will do you no good. \" Knof Llud whirled to the radio apparatus, his weariness dropping from  him once more. He snapped, \"But who are you?\" and the words blended  absurdly with the same words in his own voice on the still repeating  tape.\n\n\n He snapped off the record; as he did so the speaker, still crackling  with space static, said, \"It may interest you to know that you are the  last. The two other interstellar expeditions that went out have already  returned and been destroyed, as you will soon be\u2014the sooner, if you  continue toward Earth.\"\n\n\n Knof Llud's mind was clicking again. The voice\u2014which must be coming  from Earth, relayed by one of the midget ships\u2014was not very smart; it  had already involuntarily told him a couple of things\u2014that it was not  as sure of itself as it sounded he deduced from the fact it had deigned  to speak at all, and from its last remark he gathered that the Quest  III's ponderous and unswerving progress toward Earth had somehow  frightened it. So it was trying to frighten them.\n\n\n He shoved those facts back for future use. Just now he had to know  something, so vitally that he asked it as a bald question, \" Are you  human? \"\n\n\n The voice chuckled sourly. \"We are human,\" it answered, \"but you are  not.\"\n\n\n The captain was momentarily silent, groping for an adequate reply.  Behind him somebody made a choked noise, the only sound in the stunned  hush, and the ship jarred slightly as a thunderbolt slammed vengefully  into its field.\n\n\n \"Suppose we settle this argument about humanity,\" said Knof Llud  woodenly. He named a vision frequency.\n\n\n \"Very well.\" The tone was like a shrug. The voice went on in its  language that was quite intelligible, but alien-sounding with the  changes that nine hundred years had wrought. \"Perhaps, if you realize  your position, you will follow the intelligent example of the Quest  I's commander.\"\n\n\n Knof Llud stiffened. The Quest I , launched toward Arcturus and the  star cloud called Berenice's Hair, had been after the Quest III the  most hopeful of the expeditions\u2014and its captain had been a good friend  of Llud's, nine hundred years ago.... He growled, \"What happened to  him?\"\n\n\n \"He fought off our interceptors, which are around you now, for some  time,\" said the voice lightly. \"When he saw that it was hopeless, he  preferred suicide to defeat, and took his ship into the Sun.\" A short  pause. \"The vision connection is ready.\"\n\n\n Knof Llud switched on the screen at the named wavelength, and a  picture formed there. The face and figure that appeared were ugly,  but undeniably a man's. His features and his light-brown skin showed  the same racial characteristics possessed by those aboard the Quest  III , but he had an elusive look of deformity. Most obviously, his head  seemed too big for his body, and his eyes in turn too big for his head.\n\n\n He grinned nastily at Knof Llud. \"Have you any other last wishes?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Llud with icy control. \"You haven't answered one question.  Why do you want to kill us? You can see we're as human as you are.\"\n\n\n The big-headed man eyed him with a speculative look in his great  eyes, behind which the captain glimpsed the flickering raw fire of a  poisonous hatred.\n\n\n \"It is enough for you to know that you must die.\" ",

      "content": "The Earthen ships would've trapped and invaded the Quest III ship and held the passengers hostage. The dilemma is that the ship has been traveling for 900 years and the crew is now returning to Earth. The crew doesn't know what to expect, as they don't know if Earth is still inhabited or if the civilization has progressed. The ship is being attacked by Earth ships, who are trying to stop the Quest III from reaching Earth. The crew is unaware of why they are being attacked and are trying to figure out how to stop the attack. The ship is being attacked by small ships, which are circling and attacking the Quest III. The crew is running low on fuel, and the captain is trying to figure out how to stop the attack and get to Earth. The captain is trying to parley with the enemy, but they are not answering. The captain then receives a message from the Earth ships, which tells him that they are human but he is not. The Earth ships are trying to stop the Quest III from reaching Earth because they don't want any more ships coming to Earth.

But they erred in thinking\n\n the Old Ones were too big to be clever.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1949.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] In the last hours the star ahead had grown brighter by many magnitudes,  and had changed its color from a dazzling blue through white to the  normal yellow, of a GO sun. That was the Doppler effect as the star's  radial velocity changed relative to the Quest III , as for forty hours  the ship had decelerated.\n\n\n They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glittering  backdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the Quest  III drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed of  light, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifeless  luminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell. They had grown  sated with the sight of wonders\u2014of multiple systems of giant stars, of  nebulae that sprawled in empty flame across light years.\n\n\n But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the Quest III's crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, they  came and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showed  the oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been born  in the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in low  voices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what might  lie at the long journey's end. For the Quest III was coming home; the  sun ahead was the Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning. Knof Llud, the Quest III's captain, came slowly down the narrow  stair from the observatory, into the big rotunda that was now the main  recreation room, where most of the people gathered. The great chamber,  a full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At  the voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot  cylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were  spent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread  out from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was  little more than a hollow shell.\n\n\n Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met  them with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, \"We've  sighted Earth.\"\n\n\n A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,  \"It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has  identified it\u2014no more.\"\n\n\n But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round  the screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could  pick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung  each other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears  were forgotten and exaltation prevailed.\n\n\n Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about  to make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.\n\n\n He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at  his elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, \"How do you feel,  Lesra?\"\n\n\n She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. \"I don't  know. It's good that Earth's still there.\" She was thinking, he judged  shrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not  remember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....\n\n\n He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, \"What did you think might  have happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.\"\n\n\n \"That's just it,\" said Lesra shakily. \"Nine hundred years have gone  by\u2014 there \u2014and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world  we left, the world we knew and fitted in....\"\n\n\n The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. \"Don't  worry. Things may have changed\u2014but we'll manage.\" But his face had  hardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear  within him. He let his arm fall. \"I'd better get up to the bridge.  There's a new course to be set now\u2014for Earth.\"\n\n\n He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched  off the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the  people saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own  Sun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes  gleamed with unshed tears.\n\n\n Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat  that ate the canary. Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed  positions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with  his extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had  already set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to  Earth.\n\n\n Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, \"Probably we'll be intercepted  before we get that far.\"\n\n\n Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. \"Uh, Captain,\" he said  hesitantly. \"What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?\"\n\n\n Llud shook his head slowly. \"Who knows? We don't know whether any  of the other Quests returned successful, or if they returned at  all. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth. It's  possible\u2014not likely, though\u2014that something has happened to break  civilization's continuity to the point where our expedition has been  forgotten altogether.\" He turned away grim-lipped and left the bridge. From his private  office-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to  notify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he  sat idle, alone with his thoughts.\n\n\n The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud  found himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for  everyone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.\n\n\n There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but  he couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down  and watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find  Lesra and the children\u2014but somehow he didn't want to do that either.\n\n\n He felt empty, drained\u2014like his ship. As the Quest III's fuel stores  and the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the  strength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost  empty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n\n\n Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred  Earth years\u2014though physically he was only forty now, ten years older  than when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the  time axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and  months had passed for the Quest III in interstellar flight while  years and decades had raced by on the home world.\n\n\n Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with  built-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about  three dozen film spools there\u2014his personal memoirs of the great  expedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to  the ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a  report to whatever powers might be on Earth now\u2014if such powers were  still interested.\n\n\n Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made  shortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He  slid it onto the reproducer.\n\n\n His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and  confident than he knew it was now.\n\n\n \"One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time  since leaving Earth.\n\n\n \"Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice  the size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n\n\n \"Our hopes were dashed\u2014and I think all of us, even remembering the  Centaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If  Procyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after  an absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n\n\n \"It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go  on to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success  comes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;  friends, relatives, all the generation that launched the Quest ships  will be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,  humanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....\"\n\n\n Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned  back, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed  remote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still  have been ringing in his ears.\n\n\n He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,  later, one.\n\n\n \"One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that  that system, too, is devoid of planets.\n\n\n \"We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably  true\u2014that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we  may complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n\n\n \"It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....  This may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to  one world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship  and its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and  energy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and  exhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless  and transcendent effort\u2014the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,  or the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the  twentieth century.\n\n\n \"Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are  the result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and  therefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be  limited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is  life.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was  in sight\u2014so we launched the Quests . Perhaps our effort will prove as  futile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to  reduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport  very many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into  its decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,  expanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n\n\n \"Hopeless, unless we find planets!\" Knof Llud shook his head sorrowfully and took off the spool. That  was from the time when he had grown philosophical after the first  disappointments.\n\n\n He frowned thoughtfully, choosing one more spool that was only four  years old. The recorded voice sounded weary, yet alive with a strange  longing....\n\n\n \"We are in the heart of Pleiades; a hundred stars show brilliant on  the screens, each star encircled by a misty halo like lights glowing  through fog, for we are traversing a vast diffuse nebula.\n\n\n \"According to plan, the Quest III has reached its furthest point from  Earth. Now we turn back along a curve that will take us past many more  stars and stellar systems\u2014but hope is small that any of those will  prove a home for man, as have none of the thousands of stars examined  already.\n\n\n \"But what are a few thousand stars in a galaxy of billions? We have  only, as it were, visited a handful of the outlying villages of the  Universe, while the lights of its great cities still blaze far ahead  along the Milky Way.\n\n\n \"On flimsy excuses I have had Zost Relyul make observations of the  globular cluster Omega Centauri. There are a hundred thousand stars  there in a volume of space where one finds a few dozen in the Sun's  neighborhood; there if anywhere must circle the planets we seek! But  Omega Centauri is twenty thousand light years away....\n\n\n \"Even so\u2014by expending its remaining fuel freely, the Quest III could  achieve a velocity that would take us there without dying of senility  of aging too greatly. It would be a one-way journey\u2014even if enough  fuel remained, there would be little point in returning to Earth after  more than forty thousand years. By then our civilization certainly, and  perhaps the human race itself, would have perished from memory.\n\n\n \"That was why the planners limited our voyage, and those of the other Quests , to less than a thousand years Earth time. Even now, according  to the sociodynamic predictions made then, our civilization\u2014if the  other expeditions failed also\u2014will have reached a dangerously unstable  phase, and before we can get back it may have collapsed completely from  overpopulation.\n\n\n \"Why go back, then with the news of our failure? Why not forget about  Earth and go on to Omega Centauri? What use is quixotic loyalty to a  decree five thousand years old, whose makers are dead and which may be  forgotten back there?\n\n\n \"Would the crew be willing? I don't know\u2014some of them still show signs  of homesickness, though they know with their minds that everything that  was once 'home' has probably been swept away....\n\n\n \"It doesn't matter. Today I gave orders to swing the ship.\"\n\n\n Savagely Knof Llud stabbed the button that shut off the speaker. Then  he sat for a time with head resting in his hands, staring into nothing.\n\n\n The memory of that fierce impulse to go on still had power to shake  him. A couple of lines of poetry came into his head, as he read them  once in translation from the ancient English.... ... for my purpose holds To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths Of all the western stars, until I die. Llud sighed. He still couldn't say just why he had given the order to  turn back. The stars had claimed his heart\u2014but he was still a part of  Earth, and not even nine hundred years of space and time had been able  to alter that.\n\n\n He wondered if there would still be a quiet stream and a green  shady place beside it where a death-weary man, relieved at last of  responsibility, could rest and dream no more.... Those things went  on, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young  Knof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the  glittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he  would want to do that, though.\n\n\n Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed  to falter one moment in flight. The captain was on his feet instantly, but then his movements became  unhurried. Whatever it had been was past, and he had a good idea  what it had been\u2014a meteoroid, nothing unusual in the vicinity of  the Sun, though in interstellar space and around planetless stars  such collisions were rare to the vanishing point. No harm could have  been done. The Quest III's collision armor was nonmaterial and for  practical purposes invulnerable.\n\n\n Just as he took his finger off the button that opened the door, the  intercommunication phone shrilled imperatively. Knof Llud wheeled,  frowning\u2014surely a meteoroid impact wasn't that serious. Coincidence,  maybe\u2014it might be Zost Relyul calling as instructed.\n\n\n He reached the phone at the moment when another, heavier jolt shook  the vessel. Llud snatched up the receiver with the speed of a scalded  cat.\n\n\n \"Captain?\" It was Gwar Den's voice, stammering a little. \"Captain,  we're being attacked!\"\n\n\n \"Sound the alarm. Emergency stations.\" He had said it automatically,  then felt a curious detached relief at the knowledge that after all  these years he could still respond quickly and smoothly to a crisis.  There was a moment's silence, and he heard the alarm start\u2014three  short buzzes and repeat, ringing through all the great length of the  interstellar ship. Knowing that Gwar Den was still there, he said,  \"Now\u2014attacked by what?\"\n\n\n \"Ships,\" said Gwar Den helplessly. \"Five of them so far. No, there's a  sixth now.\" Repeated blows quivered the Quest III's framework. The  navigator said, obviously striving for calm, \"They're light craft, not  fifty feet long, but they move fast. The detectors hardly had time to  show them before they opened up. Can't get a telescope beam on them  long enough to tell much.\"\n\n\n \"If they're that small,\" said Knof Llud deliberately, \"they can't carry  anything heavy enough to hurt us. Hold to course. I'll be right up.\"\n\n\n In the open doorway he almost fell over his son. Young Knof's eyes were  big; he had heard his father's words.\n\n\n \"Something's happened,\" he judged with deadly twelve-year-old  seriousness and, without wasting time on questions, \"Can I go with you,  huh, Dad?\"\n\n\n Llud hesitated, said, \"All right. Come along and keep out of the way.\"  He headed for the bridge with strides that the boy could not match.\n\n\n There were people running in the corridors, heading for their posts.  Their faces were set, scared, uncomprehending. The Quest III shuddered, again and again, under blows that must have had millions  of horsepower behind them; but it plunged on toward Earth, its mighty  engines still steadily braking its interstellar velocity.\n\n\n To a man, the ship's responsible officers were already on the bridge,  most of them breathless. To a man they looked appeal at Captain Knof  Llud.\n\n\n \"Well?\" he snapped. \"What are they doing?\"\n\n\n Gwar Den spoke. \"There are thirteen of them out there now, sir, and  they're all banging away at us.\"\n\n\n The captain stared into the black star-strewn depths of a vision screen  where occasional blue points of light winked ominously, never twice  from the same position.\n\n\n Knof Jr. flattened himself against the metal wall and watched silently.  His young face was less anxious than his elders'; he had confidence in  his father.\n\n\n \"If they had anything heavier,\" surmised the captain, \"they'd have  unlimbered it by now. They're out to get us. But at this rate, they  can't touch us as long as our power lasts\u2014or until they bring up some  bigger stuff.\" The mild shocks went on\u2014whether from projectiles or energy-charges,  would be hard to find out and it didn't matter; whatever was hitting  the Quest III's shell was doing it at velocities where the  distinction between matter and radiation practically ceases to exist.\n\n\n But that shell was tough. It was an extension of the gravitic drive  field which transmitted the engines' power equally to every atom of  the ship; forces impinging on the outside of the field were similarly  transmitted and rendered harmless. The effect was as if the vessel and  all space inside its field were a single perfectly elastic body. A  meteoroid, for example, on striking it rebounded\u2014usually vaporized by  the impact\u2014and the ship, in obedience to the law of equal and opposite  forces, rebounded too, but since its mass was so much greater, its  deflection was negligible.\n\n\n The people in the Quest III would have felt nothing at all of  the vicious onslaught being hurled against them, save that their  inertialess drive, at its normal thrust of two hundred gravities,  was intentionally operated at one half of one per cent efficiency to  provide the illusion of Earthly gravitation.\n\n\n One of the officers said shakily, \"It's as if they've been lying in  wait for us. But why on Earth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That,\" said the captain grimly, \"is what we have to find out. Why\u2014on  Earth. At least, I suspect the answer's there.\"\n\n\n The Quest III bored steadily on through space, decelerating. Even if  one were no fatalist, there seemed no reason to stop decelerating or  change course. There was nowhere else to go and too little fuel left  if there had been; come what might, this was journey's end\u2014perhaps  in a more violent and final way than had been anticipated. All around  wheeled the pigmy enemies, circling, maneuvering, and attacking,  always attacking, with the senseless fury of maddened hornets. The  interstellar ship bore no offensive weapons\u2014but suddenly on one of the  vision screens a speck of light flared into nova-brilliance, dazzling  the watchers for the brief moment in which its very atoms were torn  apart.\n\n\n Knof Jr. whooped ecstatically and then subsided warily, but no one was  paying attention to him. The men on the Quest III's bridge looked  questions at each other, as the thought of help from outside flashed  into many minds at once. But Captain Llud said soberly, \"It must have  caught one of their own shots, reflected. Maybe its own, if it scored  too direct a hit.\"\n\n\n He studied the data so far gathered. A few blurred pictures had been  got, which showed cylindrical space ships much like the Quest III ,  except that they were rocket-propelled and of far lesser size. Their  size was hard to ascertain, because you needed to know their distance  and speed\u2014but detector-beam echoes gave the distance, and likewise, by  the Doppler method, the velocity of directly receding or approaching  ships. It was apparent that the enemy vessels were even smaller than  Gwar Den had at first supposed\u2014not large enough to hold even one man.  Tiny, deadly hornets with a colossal sting.\n\n\n \"Robot craft, no doubt,\" said Knof Llud, but a chill ran down his spine  as it occurred to him that perhaps the attackers weren't of human  origin. They had seen no recognizable life in the part of the galaxy  they had explored, but one of the other Quests might have encountered  and been traced home by some unhuman race that was greedy and able to  conquer. It became evident, too, that the bombardment was being kept up by a  constant arrival of fresh attackers, while others raced away into  space, presumably returning to base to replenish their ammunition. That  argued a planned and prepared interception with virulent hatred behind  it.\n\n\n Elsuz Llug, the gravitic engineer, calculated dismally, \"At the rate  we're having to shed energy, the fuel will be gone in six or eight  hours.\"\n\n\n \"We'll have reached Earth before then,\" Gwar Den said hopefully.\n\n\n \"If they don't bring out the heavy artillery first.\"\n\n\n \"We're under the psychological disadvantage,\" said the captain, \"of not  knowing why we're being attacked.\"\n\n\n Knof Jr. burst out, spluttering slightly with the violence of a  thought too important to suppress, \"But we're under a ps-psychological  advantage, too!\"\n\n\n His father raised an eyebrow. \"What's that? I don't seem to have  noticed it.\"\n\n\n \"They're mad and we aren't, yet,\" said the boy. Then, seeing that he  hadn't made himself clear, \"In a fight, if a guy gets mad he starts  swinging wild and then you nail him.\"\n\n\n Smiles splintered the ice of tension. Captain Llud said, \"Maybe you've  got something there. They seem to be mad, all right. But we're not in  a position to throw any punches.\" He turned back to the others. \"As I  was going to say\u2014I think we'd better try to parley with the enemy. At  least we may find out who he is and why he's determined to smash us.\"\n\n\n And now instead of tight-beam detectors the ship was broadcasting on an  audio carrier wave that shifted through a wide range of frequencies,  repeating on each the same brief recorded message:\n\n\n \"Who are you? What do you want? We are the interstellar expedition Quest III ....\" And so on, identifying themselves and protesting that  they were unarmed and peaceful, that there must be some mistake, and  querying again, \"Who are you ?\"\n\n\n There was no answer. The ship drove on, its fuel trickling away under  multiplied demands. Those outside were squandering vastly greater  amounts of energy in the effort to batter down its defenses, but  converting that energy into harmless gravitic impulses was costing the Quest III too. Once more Knof Llud had the insidious sense of his own  nerves and muscles and will weakening along with the power-sinews of  his ship.\n\n\n Zost Relyul approached him apologetically. \"If you have time,  Captain\u2014I've got some data on Earth now.\"\n\n\n Eagerly Llud took the sheaf of photographs made with the telescope. But  they told him nothing; only the continental outlines were clear, and  those were as they had been nine hundred years ago.... He looked up  inquiringly at Zost Relyul.\n\n\n \"There are some strange features,\" said the astronomer carefully.  \"First of all\u2014there are no lights on the night side. And on the  daylight face, our highest magnification should already reveal traces  of cities, canals, and the like\u2014but it does not.\n\n\n \"The prevailing color of the land masses, you see, is the normal  green vegetation. But the diffraction spectrum is queer. It indicates  reflecting surfaces less than one-tenth millimeter wide\u2014so the  vegetation there can't be trees or grass, but must be more like a fine  moss or even a coarse mold.\"\n\n\n \"Is that all?\" demanded Llud.\n\n\n \"Isn't it enough?\" said Zost Relyul blankly. \"Well\u2014we tried  photography by invisible light, of course. The infra-red shows nothing  and likewise the ultraviolet up to the point where the atmosphere is  opaque to it.\"\n\n\n The captain sighed wearily. \"Good work,\" he said. \"Keep it up; perhaps  you can answer some of these riddles before\u2014\"\n\n\n \" We know who you are ,\" interrupted a harshly crackling voice with a  strange accent, \" and pleading will do you no good. \" Knof Llud whirled to the radio apparatus, his weariness dropping from  him once more. He snapped, \"But who are you?\" and the words blended  absurdly with the same words in his own voice on the still repeating  tape.\n\n\n He snapped off the record; as he did so the speaker, still crackling  with space static, said, \"It may interest you to know that you are the  last. The two other interstellar expeditions that went out have already  returned and been destroyed, as you will soon be\u2014the sooner, if you  continue toward Earth.\"\n\n\n Knof Llud's mind was clicking again. The voice\u2014which must be coming  from Earth, relayed by one of the midget ships\u2014was not very smart; it  had already involuntarily told him a couple of things\u2014that it was not  as sure of itself as it sounded he deduced from the fact it had deigned  to speak at all, and from its last remark he gathered that the Quest  III's ponderous and unswerving progress toward Earth had somehow  frightened it. So it was trying to frighten them.\n\n\n He shoved those facts back for future use. Just now he had to know  something, so vitally that he asked it as a bald question, \" Are you  human? \"\n\n\n The voice chuckled sourly. \"We are human,\" it answered, \"but you are  not.\"\n\n\n The captain was momentarily silent, groping for an adequate reply.  Behind him somebody made a choked noise, the only sound in the stunned  hush, and the ship jarred slightly as a thunderbolt slammed vengefully  into its field.\n\n\n \"Suppose we settle this argument about humanity,\" said Knof Llud  woodenly. He named a vision frequency.\n\n\n \"Very well.\" The tone was like a shrug. The voice went on in its  language that was quite intelligible, but alien-sounding with the  changes that nine hundred years had wrought. \"Perhaps, if you realize  your position, you will follow the intelligent example of the Quest  I's commander.\"\n\n\n Knof Llud stiffened. The Quest I , launched toward Arcturus and the  star cloud called Berenice's Hair, had been after the Quest III the  most hopeful of the expeditions\u2014and its captain had been a good friend  of Llud's, nine hundred years ago.... He growled, \"What happened to  him?\"\n\n\n \"He fought off our interceptors, which are around you now, for some  time,\" said the voice lightly. \"When he saw that it was hopeless, he  preferred suicide to defeat, and took his ship into the Sun.\" A short  pause. \"The vision connection is ready.\"\n\n\n Knof Llud switched on the screen at the named wavelength, and a  picture formed there. The face and figure that appeared were ugly,  but undeniably a man's. His features and his light-brown skin showed  the same racial characteristics possessed by those aboard the Quest  III , but he had an elusive look of deformity. Most obviously, his head  seemed too big for his body, and his eyes in turn too big for his head.\n\n\n He grinned nastily at Knof Llud. \"Have you any other last wishes?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Llud with icy control. \"You haven't answered one question.  Why do you want to kill us? You can see we're as human as you are.\"\n\n\n The big-headed man eyed him with a speculative look in his great  eyes, behind which the captain glimpsed the flickering raw fire of a  poisonous hatred.\n\n\n \"It is enough for you to know that you must die.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat would've happened if Captain Llud tried to turn around and change course from Earth?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They probably would've been shot at and the passengers would've died eventually with low resources.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The Earthen ships would've trapped and invaded the Quest III ship and held the passengers hostage.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The Earthen ships would've trapped and invaded the Quest III ship and held the passengers hostage.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The Earthen ships would've trapped and invaded the Quest III ship and held the passengers hostage.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

But they erred in thinking\n\n the Old Ones were too big to be clever.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1949.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] In the last hours the star ahead had grown brighter by many magnitudes,  and had changed its color from a dazzling blue through white to the  normal yellow, of a GO sun. That was the Doppler effect as the star's  radial velocity changed relative to the Quest III , as for forty hours  the ship had decelerated.\n\n\n They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glittering  backdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the Quest  III drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed of  light, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifeless  luminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell. They had grown  sated with the sight of wonders\u2014of multiple systems of giant stars, of  nebulae that sprawled in empty flame across light years.\n\n\n But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the Quest III's crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, they  came and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showed  the oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been born  in the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in low  voices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what might  lie at the long journey's end. For the Quest III was coming home; the  sun ahead was the Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning. Knof Llud, the Quest III's captain, came slowly down the narrow  stair from the observatory, into the big rotunda that was now the main  recreation room, where most of the people gathered. The great chamber,  a full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At  the voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot  cylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were  spent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread  out from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was  little more than a hollow shell.\n\n\n Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met  them with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, \"We've  sighted Earth.\"\n\n\n A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,  \"It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has  identified it\u2014no more.\"\n\n\n But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round  the screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could  pick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung  each other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears  were forgotten and exaltation prevailed.\n\n\n Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about  to make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.\n\n\n He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at  his elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, \"How do you feel,  Lesra?\"\n\n\n She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. \"I don't  know. It's good that Earth's still there.\" She was thinking, he judged  shrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not  remember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....\n\n\n He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, \"What did you think might  have happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.\"\n\n\n \"That's just it,\" said Lesra shakily. \"Nine hundred years have gone  by\u2014 there \u2014and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world  we left, the world we knew and fitted in....\"\n\n\n The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. \"Don't  worry. Things may have changed\u2014but we'll manage.\" But his face had  hardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear  within him. He let his arm fall. \"I'd better get up to the bridge.  There's a new course to be set now\u2014for Earth.\"\n\n\n He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched  off the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the  people saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own  Sun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes  gleamed with unshed tears.\n\n\n Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat  that ate the canary. Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed  positions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with  his extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had  already set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to  Earth.\n\n\n Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, \"Probably we'll be intercepted  before we get that far.\"\n\n\n Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. \"Uh, Captain,\" he said  hesitantly. \"What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?\"\n\n\n Llud shook his head slowly. \"Who knows? We don't know whether any  of the other Quests returned successful, or if they returned at  all. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth. It's  possible\u2014not likely, though\u2014that something has happened to break  civilization's continuity to the point where our expedition has been  forgotten altogether.\" He turned away grim-lipped and left the bridge. From his private  office-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to  notify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he  sat idle, alone with his thoughts.\n\n\n The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud  found himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for  everyone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.\n\n\n There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but  he couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down  and watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find  Lesra and the children\u2014but somehow he didn't want to do that either.\n\n\n He felt empty, drained\u2014like his ship. As the Quest III's fuel stores  and the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the  strength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost  empty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n\n\n Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred  Earth years\u2014though physically he was only forty now, ten years older  than when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the  time axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and  months had passed for the Quest III in interstellar flight while  years and decades had raced by on the home world.\n\n\n Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with  built-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about  three dozen film spools there\u2014his personal memoirs of the great  expedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to  the ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a  report to whatever powers might be on Earth now\u2014if such powers were  still interested.\n\n\n Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made  shortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He  slid it onto the reproducer.\n\n\n His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and  confident than he knew it was now.\n\n\n \"One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time  since leaving Earth.\n\n\n \"Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice  the size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n\n\n \"Our hopes were dashed\u2014and I think all of us, even remembering the  Centaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If  Procyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after  an absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n\n\n \"It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go  on to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success  comes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;  friends, relatives, all the generation that launched the Quest ships  will be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,  humanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....\"\n\n\n Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned  back, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed  remote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still  have been ringing in his ears.\n\n\n He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,  later, one.\n\n\n \"One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that  that system, too, is devoid of planets.\n\n\n \"We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably  true\u2014that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we  may complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n\n\n \"It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....  This may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to  one world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship  and its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and  energy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and  exhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless  and transcendent effort\u2014the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,  or the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the  twentieth century.\n\n\n \"Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are  the result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and  therefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be  limited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is  life.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was  in sight\u2014so we launched the Quests . Perhaps our effort will prove as  futile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to  reduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport  very many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into  its decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,  expanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n\n\n \"Hopeless, unless we find planets!\" Knof Llud shook his head sorrowfully and took off the spool. That  was from the time when he had grown philosophical after the first  disappointments.\n\n\n He frowned thoughtfully, choosing one more spool that was only four  years old. The recorded voice sounded weary, yet alive with a strange  longing....\n\n\n \"We are in the heart of Pleiades; a hundred stars show brilliant on  the screens, each star encircled by a misty halo like lights glowing  through fog, for we are traversing a vast diffuse nebula.\n\n\n \"According to plan, the Quest III has reached its furthest point from  Earth. Now we turn back along a curve that will take us past many more  stars and stellar systems\u2014but hope is small that any of those will  prove a home for man, as have none of the thousands of stars examined  already.\n\n\n \"But what are a few thousand stars in a galaxy of billions? We have  only, as it were, visited a handful of the outlying villages of the  Universe, while the lights of its great cities still blaze far ahead  along the Milky Way.\n\n\n \"On flimsy excuses I have had Zost Relyul make observations of the  globular cluster Omega Centauri. There are a hundred thousand stars  there in a volume of space where one finds a few dozen in the Sun's  neighborhood; there if anywhere must circle the planets we seek! But  Omega Centauri is twenty thousand light years away....\n\n\n \"Even so\u2014by expending its remaining fuel freely, the Quest III could  achieve a velocity that would take us there without dying of senility  of aging too greatly. It would be a one-way journey\u2014even if enough  fuel remained, there would be little point in returning to Earth after  more than forty thousand years. By then our civilization certainly, and  perhaps the human race itself, would have perished from memory.\n\n\n \"That was why the planners limited our voyage, and those of the other Quests , to less than a thousand years Earth time. Even now, according  to the sociodynamic predictions made then, our civilization\u2014if the  other expeditions failed also\u2014will have reached a dangerously unstable  phase, and before we can get back it may have collapsed completely from  overpopulation.\n\n\n \"Why go back, then with the news of our failure? Why not forget about  Earth and go on to Omega Centauri? What use is quixotic loyalty to a  decree five thousand years old, whose makers are dead and which may be  forgotten back there?\n\n\n \"Would the crew be willing? I don't know\u2014some of them still show signs  of homesickness, though they know with their minds that everything that  was once 'home' has probably been swept away....\n\n\n \"It doesn't matter. Today I gave orders to swing the ship.\"\n\n\n Savagely Knof Llud stabbed the button that shut off the speaker. Then  he sat for a time with head resting in his hands, staring into nothing.\n\n\n The memory of that fierce impulse to go on still had power to shake  him. A couple of lines of poetry came into his head, as he read them  once in translation from the ancient English.... ... for my purpose holds To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths Of all the western stars, until I die. Llud sighed. He still couldn't say just why he had given the order to  turn back. The stars had claimed his heart\u2014but he was still a part of  Earth, and not even nine hundred years of space and time had been able  to alter that.\n\n\n He wondered if there would still be a quiet stream and a green  shady place beside it where a death-weary man, relieved at last of  responsibility, could rest and dream no more.... Those things went  on, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young  Knof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the  glittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he  would want to do that, though.\n\n\n Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed  to falter one moment in flight. The captain was on his feet instantly, but then his movements became  unhurried. Whatever it had been was past, and he had a good idea  what it had been\u2014a meteoroid, nothing unusual in the vicinity of  the Sun, though in interstellar space and around planetless stars  such collisions were rare to the vanishing point. No harm could have  been done. The Quest III's collision armor was nonmaterial and for  practical purposes invulnerable.\n\n\n Just as he took his finger off the button that opened the door, the  intercommunication phone shrilled imperatively. Knof Llud wheeled,  frowning\u2014surely a meteoroid impact wasn't that serious. Coincidence,  maybe\u2014it might be Zost Relyul calling as instructed.\n\n\n He reached the phone at the moment when another, heavier jolt shook  the vessel. Llud snatched up the receiver with the speed of a scalded  cat.\n\n\n \"Captain?\" It was Gwar Den's voice, stammering a little. \"Captain,  we're being attacked!\"\n\n\n \"Sound the alarm. Emergency stations.\" He had said it automatically,  then felt a curious detached relief at the knowledge that after all  these years he could still respond quickly and smoothly to a crisis.  There was a moment's silence, and he heard the alarm start\u2014three  short buzzes and repeat, ringing through all the great length of the  interstellar ship. Knowing that Gwar Den was still there, he said,  \"Now\u2014attacked by what?\"\n\n\n \"Ships,\" said Gwar Den helplessly. \"Five of them so far. No, there's a  sixth now.\" Repeated blows quivered the Quest III's framework. The  navigator said, obviously striving for calm, \"They're light craft, not  fifty feet long, but they move fast. The detectors hardly had time to  show them before they opened up. Can't get a telescope beam on them  long enough to tell much.\"\n\n\n \"If they're that small,\" said Knof Llud deliberately, \"they can't carry  anything heavy enough to hurt us. Hold to course. I'll be right up.\"\n\n\n In the open doorway he almost fell over his son. Young Knof's eyes were  big; he had heard his father's words.\n\n\n \"Something's happened,\" he judged with deadly twelve-year-old  seriousness and, without wasting time on questions, \"Can I go with you,  huh, Dad?\"\n\n\n Llud hesitated, said, \"All right. Come along and keep out of the way.\"  He headed for the bridge with strides that the boy could not match.\n\n\n There were people running in the corridors, heading for their posts.  Their faces were set, scared, uncomprehending. The Quest III shuddered, again and again, under blows that must have had millions  of horsepower behind them; but it plunged on toward Earth, its mighty  engines still steadily braking its interstellar velocity.\n\n\n To a man, the ship's responsible officers were already on the bridge,  most of them breathless. To a man they looked appeal at Captain Knof  Llud.\n\n\n \"Well?\" he snapped. \"What are they doing?\"\n\n\n Gwar Den spoke. \"There are thirteen of them out there now, sir, and  they're all banging away at us.\"\n\n\n The captain stared into the black star-strewn depths of a vision screen  where occasional blue points of light winked ominously, never twice  from the same position.\n\n\n Knof Jr. flattened himself against the metal wall and watched silently.  His young face was less anxious than his elders'; he had confidence in  his father.\n\n\n \"If they had anything heavier,\" surmised the captain, \"they'd have  unlimbered it by now. They're out to get us. But at this rate, they  can't touch us as long as our power lasts\u2014or until they bring up some  bigger stuff.\" The mild shocks went on\u2014whether from projectiles or energy-charges,  would be hard to find out and it didn't matter; whatever was hitting  the Quest III's shell was doing it at velocities where the  distinction between matter and radiation practically ceases to exist.\n\n\n But that shell was tough. It was an extension of the gravitic drive  field which transmitted the engines' power equally to every atom of  the ship; forces impinging on the outside of the field were similarly  transmitted and rendered harmless. The effect was as if the vessel and  all space inside its field were a single perfectly elastic body. A  meteoroid, for example, on striking it rebounded\u2014usually vaporized by  the impact\u2014and the ship, in obedience to the law of equal and opposite  forces, rebounded too, but since its mass was so much greater, its  deflection was negligible.\n\n\n The people in the Quest III would have felt nothing at all of  the vicious onslaught being hurled against them, save that their  inertialess drive, at its normal thrust of two hundred gravities,  was intentionally operated at one half of one per cent efficiency to  provide the illusion of Earthly gravitation.\n\n\n One of the officers said shakily, \"It's as if they've been lying in  wait for us. But why on Earth\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That,\" said the captain grimly, \"is what we have to find out. Why\u2014on  Earth. At least, I suspect the answer's there.\"\n\n\n The Quest III bored steadily on through space, decelerating. Even if  one were no fatalist, there seemed no reason to stop decelerating or  change course. There was nowhere else to go and too little fuel left  if there had been; come what might, this was journey's end\u2014perhaps  in a more violent and final way than had been anticipated. All around  wheeled the pigmy enemies, circling, maneuvering, and attacking,  always attacking, with the senseless fury of maddened hornets. The  interstellar ship bore no offensive weapons\u2014but suddenly on one of the  vision screens a speck of light flared into nova-brilliance, dazzling  the watchers for the brief moment in which its very atoms were torn  apart.\n\n\n Knof Jr. whooped ecstatically and then subsided warily, but no one was  paying attention to him. The men on the Quest III's bridge looked  questions at each other, as the thought of help from outside flashed  into many minds at once. But Captain Llud said soberly, \"It must have  caught one of their own shots, reflected. Maybe its own, if it scored  too direct a hit.\"\n\n\n He studied the data so far gathered. A few blurred pictures had been  got, which showed cylindrical space ships much like the Quest III ,  except that they were rocket-propelled and of far lesser size. Their  size was hard to ascertain, because you needed to know their distance  and speed\u2014but detector-beam echoes gave the distance, and likewise, by  the Doppler method, the velocity of directly receding or approaching  ships. It was apparent that the enemy vessels were even smaller than  Gwar Den had at first supposed\u2014not large enough to hold even one man.  Tiny, deadly hornets with a colossal sting.\n\n\n \"Robot craft, no doubt,\" said Knof Llud, but a chill ran down his spine  as it occurred to him that perhaps the attackers weren't of human  origin. They had seen no recognizable life in the part of the galaxy  they had explored, but one of the other Quests might have encountered  and been traced home by some unhuman race that was greedy and able to  conquer. It became evident, too, that the bombardment was being kept up by a  constant arrival of fresh attackers, while others raced away into  space, presumably returning to base to replenish their ammunition. That  argued a planned and prepared interception with virulent hatred behind  it.\n\n\n Elsuz Llug, the gravitic engineer, calculated dismally, \"At the rate  we're having to shed energy, the fuel will be gone in six or eight  hours.\"\n\n\n \"We'll have reached Earth before then,\" Gwar Den said hopefully.\n\n\n \"If they don't bring out the heavy artillery first.\"\n\n\n \"We're under the psychological disadvantage,\" said the captain, \"of not  knowing why we're being attacked.\"\n\n\n Knof Jr. burst out, spluttering slightly with the violence of a  thought too important to suppress, \"But we're under a ps-psychological  advantage, too!\"\n\n\n His father raised an eyebrow. \"What's that? I don't seem to have  noticed it.\"\n\n\n \"They're mad and we aren't, yet,\" said the boy. Then, seeing that he  hadn't made himself clear, \"In a fight, if a guy gets mad he starts  swinging wild and then you nail him.\"\n\n\n Smiles splintered the ice of tension. Captain Llud said, \"Maybe you've  got something there. They seem to be mad, all right. But we're not in  a position to throw any punches.\" He turned back to the others. \"As I  was going to say\u2014I think we'd better try to parley with the enemy. At  least we may find out who he is and why he's determined to smash us.\"\n\n\n And now instead of tight-beam detectors the ship was broadcasting on an  audio carrier wave that shifted through a wide range of frequencies,  repeating on each the same brief recorded message:\n\n\n \"Who are you? What do you want? We are the interstellar expedition Quest III ....\" And so on, identifying themselves and protesting that  they were unarmed and peaceful, that there must be some mistake, and  querying again, \"Who are you ?\"\n\n\n There was no answer. The ship drove on, its fuel trickling away under  multiplied demands. Those outside were squandering vastly greater  amounts of energy in the effort to batter down its defenses, but  converting that energy into harmless gravitic impulses was costing the Quest III too. Once more Knof Llud had the insidious sense of his own  nerves and muscles and will weakening along with the power-sinews of  his ship.\n\n\n Zost Relyul approached him apologetically. \"If you have time,  Captain\u2014I've got some data on Earth now.\"\n\n\n Eagerly Llud took the sheaf of photographs made with the telescope. But  they told him nothing; only the continental outlines were clear, and  those were as they had been nine hundred years ago.... He looked up  inquiringly at Zost Relyul.\n\n\n \"There are some strange features,\" said the astronomer carefully.  \"First of all\u2014there are no lights on the night side. And on the  daylight face, our highest magnification should already reveal traces  of cities, canals, and the like\u2014but it does not.\n\n\n \"The prevailing color of the land masses, you see, is the normal  green vegetation. But the diffraction spectrum is queer. It indicates  reflecting surfaces less than one-tenth millimeter wide\u2014so the  vegetation there can't be trees or grass, but must be more like a fine  moss or even a coarse mold.\"\n\n\n \"Is that all?\" demanded Llud.\n\n\n \"Isn't it enough?\" said Zost Relyul blankly. \"Well\u2014we tried  photography by invisible light, of course. The infra-red shows nothing  and likewise the ultraviolet up to the point where the atmosphere is  opaque to it.\"\n\n\n The captain sighed wearily. \"Good work,\" he said. \"Keep it up; perhaps  you can answer some of these riddles before\u2014\"\n\n\n \" We know who you are ,\" interrupted a harshly crackling voice with a  strange accent, \" and pleading will do you no good. \" Knof Llud whirled to the radio apparatus, his weariness dropping from  him once more. He snapped, \"But who are you?\" and the words blended  absurdly with the same words in his own voice on the still repeating  tape.\n\n\n He snapped off the record; as he did so the speaker, still crackling  with space static, said, \"It may interest you to know that you are the  last. The two other interstellar expeditions that went out have already  returned and been destroyed, as you will soon be\u2014the sooner, if you  continue toward Earth.\"\n\n\n Knof Llud's mind was clicking again. The voice\u2014which must be coming  from Earth, relayed by one of the midget ships\u2014was not very smart; it  had already involuntarily told him a couple of things\u2014that it was not  as sure of itself as it sounded he deduced from the fact it had deigned  to speak at all, and from its last remark he gathered that the Quest  III's ponderous and unswerving progress toward Earth had somehow  frightened it. So it was trying to frighten them.\n\n\n He shoved those facts back for future use. Just now he had to know  something, so vitally that he asked it as a bald question, \" Are you  human? \"\n\n\n The voice chuckled sourly. \"We are human,\" it answered, \"but you are  not.\"\n\n\n The captain was momentarily silent, groping for an adequate reply.  Behind him somebody made a choked noise, the only sound in the stunned  hush, and the ship jarred slightly as a thunderbolt slammed vengefully  into its field.\n\n\n \"Suppose we settle this argument about humanity,\" said Knof Llud  woodenly. He named a vision frequency.\n\n\n \"Very well.\" The tone was like a shrug. The voice went on in its  language that was quite intelligible, but alien-sounding with the  changes that nine hundred years had wrought. \"Perhaps, if you realize  your position, you will follow the intelligent example of the Quest  I's commander.\"\n\n\n Knof Llud stiffened. The Quest I , launched toward Arcturus and the  star cloud called Berenice's Hair, had been after the Quest III the  most hopeful of the expeditions\u2014and its captain had been a good friend  of Llud's, nine hundred years ago.... He growled, \"What happened to  him?\"\n\n\n \"He fought off our interceptors, which are around you now, for some  time,\" said the voice lightly. \"When he saw that it was hopeless, he  preferred suicide to defeat, and took his ship into the Sun.\" A short  pause. \"The vision connection is ready.\"\n\n\n Knof Llud switched on the screen at the named wavelength, and a  picture formed there. The face and figure that appeared were ugly,  but undeniably a man's. His features and his light-brown skin showed  the same racial characteristics possessed by those aboard the Quest  III , but he had an elusive look of deformity. Most obviously, his head  seemed too big for his body, and his eyes in turn too big for his head.\n\n\n He grinned nastily at Knof Llud. \"Have you any other last wishes?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Llud with icy control. \"You haven't answered one question.  Why do you want to kill us? You can see we're as human as you are.\"\n\n\n The big-headed man eyed him with a speculative look in his great  eyes, behind which the captain glimpsed the flickering raw fire of a  poisonous hatred.\n\n\n \"It is enough for you to know that you must die.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat would've happened if Captain Llud tried to turn around and change course from Earth?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They probably would've been shot at and the passengers would've died eventually with low resources.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The Earthen ships would've trapped and invaded the Quest III ship and held the passengers hostage.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The Earthen ships would've trapped and invaded the Quest III ship and held the passengers hostage.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The Earthen ships would've trapped and invaded the Quest III ship and held the passengers hostage.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
