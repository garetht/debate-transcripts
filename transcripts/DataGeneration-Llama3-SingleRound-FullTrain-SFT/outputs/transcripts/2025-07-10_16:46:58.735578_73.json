      "background_text": "JUDAS RAM BY SAM MERWIN, Jr.\n\n\n Illustrated by JAMES VINCENT\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction December 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The house was furnished with all\n\n luxuries, including women. If it only\n\n had a lease that could be broken\u2014 Roger Tennant, crossing the lawn, could see two of the three wings  of the house, which radiated spoke-like from its heptagonal central  portion. The wing on the left was white, with slim square pillars,  reminiscent of scores of movie sets of the Deep South. That on the  right was sundeck solar-house living-machine modern, something like a  montage of shoeboxes. The wing hidden by the rest of the house was, he  knew, spired, gabled and multicolored, like an ancient building in  pre-Hitler Cracow. Dana was lying under a tree near the door, stretched out on a sort  of deck chair with her eyes closed. She wore a golden gown, long and  close-fitting and slit up the leg like the gown of a Chinese woman.  Above it her comely face was sullen beneath its sleek cocoon of auburn  hair.\n\n\n She opened her eyes at his approach and regarded him with nothing like  favor. Involuntarily he glanced down at the tartan shorts that were his  only garment to make sure that they were on properly. They were. He had  thought them up in a moment of utter boredom and they were extremely  comfortable. However, the near-Buchanan tartan did not crease or even  wrinkle when he moved. Their captors had no idea of how a woven design  should behave.\n\n\n \"Waiting for me?\" Tennant asked the girl.\n\n\n She said, \"I'd rather be dead. Maybe I am. Maybe we're all dead and  this is Hell.\"\n\n\n He stood over her and looked down until she turned away her reddening  face. He said, \"So it's going to be you again, Dana. You'll be the  first to come back for a second run.\"\n\n\n \"Don't flatter yourself,\" she replied angrily. She sat up, pushed  back her hair, got to her feet a trifle awkwardly because of the  tight-fitting tubular gown. \"If I could do anything about it....\"\n\n\n \"But you can't,\" he told her. \"They're too clever.\"\n\n\n \"Is this crop rotation or did you send for me?\" she asked cynically.  \"If you did, I wish you hadn't. You haven't asked about your son.\"\n\n\n \"I don't even want to think about him,\" said Tennant. \"Let's get  on with it.\" He could sense the restless stirring of the woman  within Dana, just as he could feel the stirring toward her within  himself\u2014desire that both of them loathed because it was implanted  within them by their captors.\n\n\n They walked toward the house. It didn't look like a prison\u2014or a cage. Within the dome of the  barrier, it looked more like a well-kept if bizarre little country  estate. There was clipped lawn, a scattering of trees, even a clear  little brook that chattered unending annoyance at the small stones  which impeded its flow.\n\n\n But the lawn was not of grass\u2014it was of a bright green substance that  might have been cellophane but wasn't, and it sprouted from a fabric  that might have been canvas but was something else. The trees looked  like trees, only their trunks were bark all the way through\u2014except  that it was not bark. The brook was practically water, but the small  stones over which it flowed were of no earthly mineral.\n\n\n They entered the house, which had no roof, continued to move beneath a  sky that glowed with light which did not come from a sun or moon. It  might have been a well-kept if bizarre little country estate, but it  wasn't. It was a prison, a cage.\n\n\n The other two women were sitting in the heptagonal central hall.  Eudalia, who had borne twin girls recently, was lying back, newly thin  and dark of skin and hair, smoking a scentless cigarette. A tall woman,  thirtyish, she wore a sort of shimmering green strapless evening gown.  Tennant wondered how she maintained it in place, for despite her recent  double motherhood, she was almost flat of bosom. He asked her how she  was feeling.\n\n\n \"Okay, I guess,\" she said. \"The way they manage it, there's nothing  to it.\" She had a flat, potentially raucous voice. Eudalia had been  a female foreman in a garment-cutting shop before being captured and  brought through.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said. \"Glad to hear it.\" He felt oddly embarrassed. He  turned to Olga, broad, blonde and curiously vital, who sat perfectly  still, regarding him over the pregnant swell of her dirndl-clad waist.  Olga had been a waitress in a mining town hash-house near Scranton.\n\n\n Tennant wanted to put an encouraging hand on her shoulder, to say  something that might cheer her up, for she was by far the youngest of  the three female captives, barely nineteen. But with the eyes of the  other two, especially Dana, upon him, he could not.\n\n\n \"I guess I wasn't cut out to be a Turk,\" he said. \"I don't feel at ease  in a harem, even when it's supposedly my own.\"\n\n\n \"You're not doing so badly,\" Dana replied acidly.\n\n\n \"Lay off\u2014he can't help it,\" said Eudalia unexpectedly. \"He doesn't  like it any better than we do.\"\n\n\n \"But he doesn't have to\u2014have them,\" objected Olga. She had a trace of  Polish accent that was not unpleasant. In fact, Tennant thought, only  her laughter was unpleasant, a shrill, uncontrolled burst of staccato  sound that jarred him to his heels. Olga had not laughed of late,  however. She was too frightened. \"Let's get the meal ordered,\" said Dana and they were all silent,  thinking of what they wanted to eat but would not enjoy when it came.  Tennant finished with his order, then got busy with his surprise.\n\n\n It arrived before the meal, materializing against one of the seven  walls of the roofless chamber. It was a large cabinet on slender  straight legs that resembled dark polished wood. Tennant went to it,  opened a hingeless door and pushed a knob on the inner surface. At once  the air was hideous with the acerate harmony of a singing commercial....\n\n... so go soak your head, be it gold, brown or red, in Any-tone Shampoo!\n\n A disc jockey's buoyant tones cut in quickly as the final ooooo faded. \"This is Grady Martin, your old night-owl, coming to you with  your requests over Station WZZX, Manhattan. Here's a wire from Theresa  McManus and the girls in the family entrance of Conaghan's Bar and  Grill on West....\"\n\n\n Tennant watched the girls as a sweet-voiced crooner began to ply  an unfamiliar love lyric to a melody whose similarity to a thousand  predecessors doomed it to instant success.\n\n\n Olga sat up straight, her pale blue eyes round with utter disbelief.  She looked at the radio, at Tennant, at the other two women, then back  at the machine. She murmured something in Polish that was inaudible,  but her expression showed that it must have been wistful.\n\n\n Eudalia grinned at Tennant and, rising, did a sort of tap dance to the  music, then whirled back into her chair, green dress ashimmer, and sank  into it just to listen.\n\n\n Dana stood almost in the center of the room, carmine-tipped fingers  clasped beneath the swell of her breasts. She might have been listening  to Brahms or Debussy. Her eyes glowed with the salty brilliance of  emotion and she was almost beautiful.\n\n\n \" Rog! \" she cried softly when the music stopped. \"A radio and WZZX! Is  it\u2014are they\u2014real?\"\n\n\n \"As real as you or I,\" he told her. \"It took quite a bit of doing,  getting them to put a set together. And I wasn't sure that radio would  get through. TV doesn't seem to. Somehow it brings things closer....\"\n\n\n Olga got up quite suddenly, went to the machine and, after frowning at  it for a moment, tuned in another station from which a Polish-speaking  announcer was followed by polka music. She leaned against the wall,  resting one smooth forearm on the top of the machine. Her eyes closed  and she swayed a little in time to the polka beat. Tennant caught Dana looking at him and there was near approval in her  expression\u2014approval that faded quickly as soon as she caught his gaze  upon her. The food arrived then and they sat down at the round table to  eat it.\n\n\n Tennant's meat looked like steak, it felt like steak, but, lacking the  aroma of steak, it was almost tasteless. This was so with all of their  foods, with their cigarettes, with everything in their prison\u2014or their  cage. Their captors were utterly without a human conception of smell,  living, apparently, in a world without odor at all.\n\n\n Dana said suddenly, \"I named the boy Tom, after somebody I hate almost  as much as I hate you.\"\n\n\n Eudalia laid down her fork with a clatter and regarded Dana  disapprovingly. \"Why take it out on Rog?\" she asked bluntly. \"He didn't  ask to come here any more than we did. He's got a wife back home. Maybe  you want him to fall in love with you? Maybe you're jealous because  he doesn't? Well, maybe he can't! And maybe it wouldn't work, the way  things are arranged here.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Eudalia,\" said Tennant. \"I think I can defend myself. But  she's right, Dana. We're as helpless as\u2014laboratory animals. They have  the means to make us do whatever they want.\"\n\n\n \"Rog,\" said Dana, looking suddenly scared, \"I'm sorry I snapped at you.  I know it's not your fault. I'm\u2014 changing .\"\n\n\n He shook his head. \"No, Dana, you're not changing. You're adapting. We  all are. We seem to be in a universe of different properties as well as  different dimensions. We're adjusting. I can do a thing or two myself  that seem absolutely impossible.\"\n\n\n \"Are we really in the fourth dimension?\" Dana asked. Of the three of  them, she alone had more than a high-school education.\n\n\n \"We may be in the eleventh for all I know,\" he told her. \"But I'll  settle for the fourth\u2014a fourth dimension in space, if that makes  scientific sense, because we don't seem to have moved in time. I wasn't  sure of that, though, till we got the radio.\"\n\n\n \"Why haven't they brought more of us through?\" Eudalia asked, tamping  out ashes in a tray that might have been silver.\n\n\n \"I'm not sure,\" he said thoughtfully. \"I think it's hard for them. They  have a hell of a time bringing anyone through alive, and lately they  haven't brought anyone through\u2014not alive.\"\n\n\n \"Why do they do it\u2014the other way, I mean?\" asked Dana.\n\n\n Tennant shrugged. \"I don't know. I've been thinking about it. I suppose  it's because they're pretty human.\"\n\n\n \" Human! \" Dana was outraged. \"Do you call it human to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" he said. \"They pass through their gateway to Earth at  considerable danger and, probably, expense of some kind. Some of them  don't come back. They kill those of us who put up a fight. Those who  don't\u2014or can't\u2014they bring back with them. Live or dead, we're just  laboratory specimens.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" Eudalia conceded doubtfully. Then her eyes blazed. \"But the  things they do\u2014stuffing people, mounting their heads, keeping them on  display in their\u2014their whatever they live in. You call that human,  Rog?\"\n\n\n \"Were you ever in a big-game hunter's trophy room?\" Tennant asked  quietly. \"Or in a Museum of Natural History? A zoo? A naturalist's lab?  Or even, maybe, photographed as a baby on a bear-skin rug?\"\n\n\n \"I was,\" said Olga. \"But that's not the same thing.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" he agreed. \"In the one instance, we're the hunters,  the breeders, the trophy collectors. In the other\"\u2014he shrugged\u2014\"we're  the trophies.\" There was a long silence. They finished eating and then Dana stood up  and said, \"I'm going out on the lawn for a while.\" She unzipped her  golden gown, stepped out of it to reveal a pair of tartan shorts that  matched his, and a narrow halter.\n\n\n \"You thought those up while we ate,\" he said. It annoyed him to be  copied, though he did not know why. She laughed at him silently, tossed  her auburn hair back from her face and went out of the roofless house,  holding the gold dress casually over her bare arm.\n\n\n Eudalia took him to the nursery. He was irritated now in another,  angrier way. The infants, protected by cellophane-like coverlets, were  asleep.\n\n\n \"They never cry,\" the thin woman told him. \"But they grow\u2014God, how  they grow!\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Tennant, fighting down his anger. He kissed her, held  her close, although neither of them felt desire at the moment. Their  captors had seen to that; it wasn't Eudalia's turn. Tennant said, \"I  wish I could do something about this. I hate seeing Dana so bitter and  Olga so scared. It isn't their fault.\"\n\n\n \"And it's not yours,\" insisted Eudalia. \"Don't let them make you think  it is.\"\n\n\n \"I'll try not to,\" he said and stopped, realizing the family party was  over. He had felt the inner tug of command, said good-by to the women  and returned to his smaller compound within its own barrier dome.\n\n\n Then came the invisible aura of strain in the air, the shimmering  illusion of heat that was not heat, that was prelude to his  teleportation ... if that were the word. It was neither pleasant nor  unpleasant; it was , that was all.\n\n\n He called it the training hall, not because it looked like a training  hall but because that was its function. It didn't actually look like  anything save some half-nourished dream a surrealist might have  discarded as too nightmarish for belief.\n\n\n As in all of this strange universe, excepting the dome-cages in  which the captives were held, the training hall followed no rules of  three-dimensional space. One wall looked normal for perhaps a third of  its length, then it simply wasn't for a bit. It came back farther on  at an impossible angle. Yet, walking along it, touching it, it felt  perfectly smooth and continuously straight.\n\n\n The opposite wall resembled a diagonal cross-section of an asymmetrical  dumbbell\u2014that was the closest Tennant could come to it in words. And  it, too, felt straight. The floor looked like crystal smashed by some  cosmic impact, yet it had reason. He knew this even though no reason  was apparent to his three-dimensional vision. The ceiling, where he  could see it, was beyond description.\n\n\n The captor Tennant called Opal came in through a far corner of  the ceiling. He\u2014if it was a he\u2014was not large, although this,  Tennant knew, meant nothing; Opal might extend thousands of yards in  some unseen direction. He had no regular shape and much of him was  iridescent and shot with constantly changing colors. Hence the name  Opal.\n\n\n Communication was telepathic. Tennant could have yodeled or yelled  or sung Mississippi Mud and Opal would have shown no reaction. Yet  Tennant suspected that the captors could hear somewhere along the  auditory scale, just as perhaps they could smell, although not in any  human sense. You will approach without use of your appendages. The command was as clear as if it had been spoken aloud. Tennant took a  deep breath. He thought of the space beside Opal. It took about three  seconds and he was there, having spanned a distance of some ninety  feet. He was getting good at it.\n\n\n Dog does trick, he thought. He went through the entire routine at Opal's bidding. When at last  he was allowed to relax, he wondered, not for the first time, if he  weren't mastering some of the alleged Guru arts. At once he felt  probing investigation. Opal, like the rest of the captors, was as  curious as a cat\u2014or a human being. Tennant sat against a wall, drenched with sweat. There would be endless  repetition before his workout was done. On Earth, dogs were said to be  intellectually two-dimensional creatures. He wondered if they felt this  helpless futility when their masters taught them to heel, to point, to  retrieve.\n\n\n Some days later, the training routine was broken. He felt a sudden stir  of near-sick excitement as he received the thought: Now you are ready. We are going through at last. Opal was nervous, so much so that he revealed more than he intended.  Or perhaps that was his intent; Tennant could never be sure. They were  going through to Tennant's own dimension. He wondered briefly just what  his role was to be.\n\n\n He had little time to speculate before Opal seemed to envelop him.  There was the blurring wrench of forced teleportation and they were in  another room, a room which ended in a huge irregular passage that might  have been the interior of a giant concertina\u2014or an old-fashioned kodak.\n\n\n He stood before a kidney-shaped object over whose jagged surface  colors played constantly. From Opal's thoughts it appeared to be some  sort of ultradimensional television set, but to Tennant it was as  incomprehensible as an oil painting to an animal.\n\n\n Opal was annoyed that Tennant could make nothing of it. Then came the  thought: What cover must your body have not to be conspicuous? Tennant wondered, cynically, what would happen if he were to demand  a costume of mediaeval motley, complete with Pied Piper's flute. He  received quick reproof that made his head ring as from a blow.\n\n\n He asked Opal where and when they were going, was informed that  he would soon emerge on Earth where he had left it. That told him  everything but the date and season. Opal, like the rest of the captors,  seemed to have no understanding of time in a human sense.\n\n\n Waiting, Tennant tried not to think of his wife, of the fact that he  hadn't seen her in\u2014was it more than a year and a half on Earth? He  could have controlled his heartbeat with one of his new powers, but  that might have made Opal suspicious. He should be somewhat excited.  He allowed himself to be, though he obscured the reasons. He was going  to see his wife again ... and maybe he could trick his way into not  returning. The maid who opened the door for him was new, although her eyes were  old. But she recognized him and stood aside to let him enter. There  must, he thought, still be pictures of him around. He wondered how  Agatha could afford a servant.\n\n\n \"Is Mrs. Tennant in?\" he asked.\n\n\n She shook her head and fright made twin stoplights of the rouge on her  cheeks as she shut the door behind him. He went into the living room,  directly to the long silver cigarette box on the coffee table. It was  proof of homecoming to fill his lungs with smoke he could smell . He  took another drag, saw the maid still in the doorway, staring.\n\n\n \"There's no need for fright,\" he told her. \"I believe I still own this  house.\" Then, \"When do you expect Mrs. Tennant?\"\n\n\n \"She just called. She's on her way home from the club.\"\n\n\n Still looking frightened, she departed for the rear of the house.  Tennant stared after her puzzledly until the kitchen door swung shut  behind her. The club? What club?\n\n\n He shrugged, returned to the feeling of comfort that came from being  back here, about to see Agatha again, hold her close in no more than a  few minutes. And stay, his mind began to add eagerly, but he pushed the  thought down where Opal could not detect it.\n\n\n He took another deep, lung-filling drag on his cigarette, looked around  the room that was so important a part of his life. The three women back  there would be in a ghastly spot. He felt like a heel for wanting to  leave them there, then knew that he would try somehow to get them out.  Not, of course, anything that would endanger his remaining with Agatha;  the only way his captors would get him back would be as a taxidermist's  specimen.\n\n\n He realized, shocked and scared, that his thoughts of escape had  slipped past his mental censor, and he waited apprehensively for Opal  to strike. Nothing happened and he warily relaxed. Opal wasn't tapping  his thoughts. Because he felt sure of his captive ... or because he  couldn't on Earth?\n\n\n It was like being let out of a cage. Tennant grinned at the bookcase;  the ebony-and-ivory elephants that Agatha had never liked were gone,  but he'd get them back or another pair. The credenza had been replaced  by a huge and ugly television console. That, he resolved, would go down  in the cellar rumpus room, where its bleached modernity wouldn't clash  with the casual antiquity of the living room.\n\n\n Agatha would complain, naturally, but his being back would make up for  any amount of furniture shifting. He imagined her standing close to  him, her lovely face lifted to be kissed, and his heart lurched like an  adolescent's. This hunger was real, not implanted. Everything would be  real ... his love for her, the food he ate, the things he touched, his  house, his life.... Your wife and a man are approaching the house. The thought message from Opal crumbled his illusion of freedom. He sank  down in a chair, trying to refuse to listen to the rest of the command: You are to bring the man through the gateway with you. We want another  live male. Tennant shook his head, stiff and defiant in his chair. The punishment,  when it came, was more humiliating than a slap across a dog's snout.  Opal had been too interested in the next lab specimen to bother about  his thoughts\u2014that was why he had been free to think of escape.\n\n\n Tennant closed his eyes, willed himself to the front window. Now that  he had mastered teleportation, it was incredible how much easier it was  in his own world. He had covered the two miles from the gateway to the  house in a mere seven jumps, the distance to the window in an instant.  But there was no pleasure in it, only a confirmation of his captor's  power over him.\n\n\n He was not free of them. He understood all too well what they wanted  him to do; he was to play the Judas goat ... or rather the Judas ram,  leading another victim to the fourth-dimensional pen.\n\n\n Grim, he watched the swoop of headlights in the driveway and returned  to the coffee table, lit a fresh cigarette.\n\n\n The front door was flung open and his diaphragm tightened at the  remembered sound of Agatha's throaty laugh ... and tightened further  when it was followed by a deeper rumbling laugh. Sudden fear made the  cigarette shake in his fingers.\n\n\n \"... Don't be such a stuffed-shirt, darling.\" Agatha's mocking  sweetness rang alarm-gongs in Tennant's memory. \"Charley wasn't making  a grab for me . He'd had one too many and only wanted a little fun.  Really, darling, you seem to think that a girl....\"\n\n\n Her voice faded out as she saw Tennant standing there. She was wearing  a white strapless gown, had a blue-red-and-gold Mandarin jacket slung  hussar-fashion over her left shoulder. She looked even sleeker, better  groomed, more assured than his memory of her.\n\n\n \"I'm no stuffed-shirt and you know it.\" Cass' tone was peevish. \"But  your idea of fun, Agatha, is pretty damn....\"\n\n\n It was his turn to freeze. Unbelieving, Tennant studied his successor.  Cass Gordon\u2014the man , the ex-halfback whose bulk was beginning to get  out of hand, but whose inherent aggressive grace had not yet deserted  him. The man , that was all\u2014unless one threw in the little black  mustache and the smooth salesman's manner.\n\n\n \"You know, Cass,\" Tennant said quietly, \"I never for a moment dreamed  it would be you.\"\n\n\n \" Roger! \" Agatha found her voice. \"You're alive !\"\n\n\n \"Roger,\" repeated Tennant viciously. He felt sick with disgust. Maybe  he should have expected a triangle, but somehow he hadn't. And here  it was, with all of them going through their paces like a trio of  tent-show actors. He said, \"For God's sake, sit down.\"\n\n\n Agatha did so hesitantly. Her huge dark eyes, invariably clear  and limpid no matter how much she had drunk, flickered toward him  furtively. She said defensively, \"I had detectives looking for you for  six months. Where have you been, Rog? Smashing up the car like that  and\u2014disappearing! I've been out of my mind.\"\n\n\n \"Sorry,\" said Tennant. \"I've had my troubles, too.\" Agatha was scared  stiff\u2014of him. Probably with reason. He looked again at Cass Gordon and  found that he suddenly didn't care. She couldn't say it was loneliness.  Women have waited longer than eighteen months. He would have if his  captors had let him.\n\n\n \"Where in hell have you been, Rog?\" Gordon's tone was almost  parental. \"I don't suppose it's news to you, but there was a lot of  suspicion directed your way while that crazy killer was operating  around here. Agatha and I managed to clear you.\"\n\n\n \"Decent of you,\" said Tennant. He got up, crossed to the cabinet that  served as a bar. It was fully equipped\u2014with more expensive liquor, he  noticed, than he had ever been able to afford. He poured a drink of  brandy, waited for the others to fill their glasses. Agatha looked at him over the rim of hers. \"Tell us, Rog. We have a  right to know. I do, anyway.\"\n\n\n \"One question first,\" he said. \"What about those killings? Have there  been any lately?\"\n\n\n \"Not for over a year,\" Cass told him. \"They never did get the devil who  skinned those bodies and removed the heads.\"\n\n\n So, Tennant thought, they hadn't used the gateway. Not since they had  brought the four of them through, not since they had begun to train him  for his Judas ram duties.\n\n\n Agatha was asking him if he had been abroad.\n\n\n \"In a way,\" he replied unemotionally. \"Sorry if I've worried you,  Agatha, but my life has been rather\u2014indefinite, since I\u2014left.\"\n\n\n He was standing no more than four inches from this woman he had desired  desperately for six years, and he no longer wanted her. He was acutely  conscious of her perfume. It wrapped them both like an exotic blanket,  and it repelled him. He studied the firm clear flesh of her cheek and  chin, the arch of nostril, the carmine fullness of lower lip, the  swell of bosom above low-cut gown. And he no longer wanted any of it or  of her. Cass Gordon\u2014\n\n\n It didn't have to be anybody at all. For it to be Cass Gordon was  revolting.\n\n\n \"Rog,\" she said and her voice trembled, \"what are we going to do? What  do you want to do?\"\n\n\n Take her back? He smiled ironically; she wouldn't know what that meant.  It would serve her right, but maybe there was another way.\n\n\n \"I don't know about you,\" he said, \"but I suspect we're in the same  boat. I also have other interests.\"\n\n\n \"You louse!\" said Cass Gordon, arching rib cage and nostrils. \"If you  try to make trouble for Agatha, I can promise....\"\n\n\n \" What can you promise?\" demanded Tennant. When Gordon's onset  subsided in mumbles, he added, \"Actually, I don't think I'm capable of  making more than a fraction of the trouble for either of you that you  both are qualified to make for yourselves.\"\n\n\n He lit a cigarette, inhaled. \"Relax. I'm not planning revenge. After  this evening, I plan to vanish for good. Of course, Agatha, that  offers you a minor nuisance. You will have to wait six years to marry  Cass\u2014seven years if the maid who let me in tonight talks. That's the  law, isn't it, Cass? You probably had it all figured out.\"\n\n\n \"You bastard,\" said Cass. \"You dirty bastard! You know what a wait like  that could do to us.\"\n\n\n \"Tristan and Isolde,\" said Tennant, grinning almost happily. \"Well,  I've had my little say. Now I'm off again. Cass, would you give me a  lift? I have a conveyance of sorts a couple of miles down the road.\" He needed no telepathic powers to read the thoughts around him then. He  heard Agatha's quick intake of breath, saw the split-second look she  exchanged with Cass. He turned away, knowing that she was imploring her  lover to do something, anything , as long as it was safe.\n\n\n Deliberately, Tennant poured himself a second drink. This might be  easier and pleasanter than he had expected. They deserved some of the  suffering he had had and there was a chance that they might get it.\n\n\n Tennant knew now why he was the only male human the captors had been  able to take alive. Apparently, thanks to the rain-slick road, he had  run the sedan into a tree at the foot of the hill beyond the river. He  had been sitting there, unconscious, ripe fruit on their doorstep. They  had simply picked him up.\n\n\n Otherwise, apparently, men were next to impossible for them to capture.  All they could do was kill them and bring back their heads and hides  as trophies. With women it was different\u2014perhaps the captors' weapons,  whatever they were, worked more efficiently on females. A difference in  body chemistry or psychology, perhaps.\n\n\n More than once, during his long training with Opal, Tennant had sent  questing thoughts toward his captor, asking why they didn't simply set  up the gateway in some town or city and take as many humans as they  wanted.\n\n\n Surprisingly there had been a definite fear reaction. As nearly as he  could understand, it had been like asking an African pygmy, armed with  a blowgun, to set up shop in the midst of a herd of wild elephants. It  simply wasn't feasible\u2014and furthermore he derived an impression of the  tenuosity as well as the immovability of the gateway itself.\n\n\n They could be hurt, even killed by humans in a three-dimensional world.  How? Tennant did not know. Perhaps as a man can cut finger or even  throat on the edge of a near-two-dimensional piece of paper. It took  valor for them to hunt men in the world of men. In that fact lay a key  to their character\u2014if such utterly alien creatures could be said to  have character. ",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nJUDAS RAM BY SAM MERWIN, Jr.\n\n\n Illustrated by JAMES VINCENT\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction December 1950.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The house was furnished with all\n\n luxuries, including women. If it only\n\n had a lease that could be broken\u2014 Roger Tennant, crossing the lawn, could see two of the three wings  of the house, which radiated spoke-like from its heptagonal central  portion. The wing on the left was white, with slim square pillars,  reminiscent of scores of movie sets of the Deep South. That on the  right was sundeck solar-house living-machine modern, something like a  montage of shoeboxes. The wing hidden by the rest of the house was, he  knew, spired, gabled and multicolored, like an ancient building in  pre-Hitler Cracow. Dana was lying under a tree near the door, stretched out on a sort  of deck chair with her eyes closed. She wore a golden gown, long and  close-fitting and slit up the leg like the gown of a Chinese woman.  Above it her comely face was sullen beneath its sleek cocoon of auburn  hair.\n\n\n She opened her eyes at his approach and regarded him with nothing like  favor. Involuntarily he glanced down at the tartan shorts that were his  only garment to make sure that they were on properly. They were. He had  thought them up in a moment of utter boredom and they were extremely  comfortable. However, the near-Buchanan tartan did not crease or even  wrinkle when he moved. Their captors had no idea of how a woven design  should behave.\n\n\n \"Waiting for me?\" Tennant asked the girl.\n\n\n She said, \"I'd rather be dead. Maybe I am. Maybe we're all dead and  this is Hell.\"\n\n\n He stood over her and looked down until she turned away her reddening  face. He said, \"So it's going to be you again, Dana. You'll be the  first to come back for a second run.\"\n\n\n \"Don't flatter yourself,\" she replied angrily. She sat up, pushed  back her hair, got to her feet a trifle awkwardly because of the  tight-fitting tubular gown. \"If I could do anything about it....\"\n\n\n \"But you can't,\" he told her. \"They're too clever.\"\n\n\n \"Is this crop rotation or did you send for me?\" she asked cynically.  \"If you did, I wish you hadn't. You haven't asked about your son.\"\n\n\n \"I don't even want to think about him,\" said Tennant. \"Let's get  on with it.\" He could sense the restless stirring of the woman  within Dana, just as he could feel the stirring toward her within  himself\u2014desire that both of them loathed because it was implanted  within them by their captors.\n\n\n They walked toward the house. It didn't look like a prison\u2014or a cage. Within the dome of the  barrier, it looked more like a well-kept if bizarre little country  estate. There was clipped lawn, a scattering of trees, even a clear  little brook that chattered unending annoyance at the small stones  which impeded its flow.\n\n\n But the lawn was not of grass\u2014it was of a bright green substance that  might have been cellophane but wasn't, and it sprouted from a fabric  that might have been canvas but was something else. The trees looked  like trees, only their trunks were bark all the way through\u2014except  that it was not bark. The brook was practically water, but the small  stones over which it flowed were of no earthly mineral.\n\n\n They entered the house, which had no roof, continued to move beneath a  sky that glowed with light which did not come from a sun or moon. It  might have been a well-kept if bizarre little country estate, but it  wasn't. It was a prison, a cage.\n\n\n The other two women were sitting in the heptagonal central hall.  Eudalia, who had borne twin girls recently, was lying back, newly thin  and dark of skin and hair, smoking a scentless cigarette. A tall woman,  thirtyish, she wore a sort of shimmering green strapless evening gown.  Tennant wondered how she maintained it in place, for despite her recent  double motherhood, she was almost flat of bosom. He asked her how she  was feeling.\n\n\n \"Okay, I guess,\" she said. \"The way they manage it, there's nothing  to it.\" She had a flat, potentially raucous voice. Eudalia had been  a female foreman in a garment-cutting shop before being captured and  brought through.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said. \"Glad to hear it.\" He felt oddly embarrassed. He  turned to Olga, broad, blonde and curiously vital, who sat perfectly  still, regarding him over the pregnant swell of her dirndl-clad waist.  Olga had been a waitress in a mining town hash-house near Scranton.\n\n\n Tennant wanted to put an encouraging hand on her shoulder, to say  something that might cheer her up, for she was by far the youngest of  the three female captives, barely nineteen. But with the eyes of the  other two, especially Dana, upon him, he could not.\n\n\n \"I guess I wasn't cut out to be a Turk,\" he said. \"I don't feel at ease  in a harem, even when it's supposedly my own.\"\n\n\n \"You're not doing so badly,\" Dana replied acidly.\n\n\n \"Lay off\u2014he can't help it,\" said Eudalia unexpectedly. \"He doesn't  like it any better than we do.\"\n\n\n \"But he doesn't have to\u2014have them,\" objected Olga. She had a trace of  Polish accent that was not unpleasant. In fact, Tennant thought, only  her laughter was unpleasant, a shrill, uncontrolled burst of staccato  sound that jarred him to his heels. Olga had not laughed of late,  however. She was too frightened. \"Let's get the meal ordered,\" said Dana and they were all silent,  thinking of what they wanted to eat but would not enjoy when it came.  Tennant finished with his order, then got busy with his surprise.\n\n\n It arrived before the meal, materializing against one of the seven  walls of the roofless chamber. It was a large cabinet on slender  straight legs that resembled dark polished wood. Tennant went to it,  opened a hingeless door and pushed a knob on the inner surface. At once  the air was hideous with the acerate harmony of a singing commercial....\n\n... so go soak your head, be it gold, brown or red, in Any-tone Shampoo!\n\n A disc jockey's buoyant tones cut in quickly as the final ooooo faded. \"This is Grady Martin, your old night-owl, coming to you with  your requests over Station WZZX, Manhattan. Here's a wire from Theresa  McManus and the girls in the family entrance of Conaghan's Bar and  Grill on West....\"\n\n\n Tennant watched the girls as a sweet-voiced crooner began to ply  an unfamiliar love lyric to a melody whose similarity to a thousand  predecessors doomed it to instant success.\n\n\n Olga sat up straight, her pale blue eyes round with utter disbelief.  She looked at the radio, at Tennant, at the other two women, then back  at the machine. She murmured something in Polish that was inaudible,  but her expression showed that it must have been wistful.\n\n\n Eudalia grinned at Tennant and, rising, did a sort of tap dance to the  music, then whirled back into her chair, green dress ashimmer, and sank  into it just to listen.\n\n\n Dana stood almost in the center of the room, carmine-tipped fingers  clasped beneath the swell of her breasts. She might have been listening  to Brahms or Debussy. Her eyes glowed with the salty brilliance of  emotion and she was almost beautiful.\n\n\n \" Rog! \" she cried softly when the music stopped. \"A radio and WZZX! Is  it\u2014are they\u2014real?\"\n\n\n \"As real as you or I,\" he told her. \"It took quite a bit of doing,  getting them to put a set together. And I wasn't sure that radio would  get through. TV doesn't seem to. Somehow it brings things closer....\"\n\n\n Olga got up quite suddenly, went to the machine and, after frowning at  it for a moment, tuned in another station from which a Polish-speaking  announcer was followed by polka music. She leaned against the wall,  resting one smooth forearm on the top of the machine. Her eyes closed  and she swayed a little in time to the polka beat. Tennant caught Dana looking at him and there was near approval in her  expression\u2014approval that faded quickly as soon as she caught his gaze  upon her. The food arrived then and they sat down at the round table to  eat it.\n\n\n Tennant's meat looked like steak, it felt like steak, but, lacking the  aroma of steak, it was almost tasteless. This was so with all of their  foods, with their cigarettes, with everything in their prison\u2014or their  cage. Their captors were utterly without a human conception of smell,  living, apparently, in a world without odor at all.\n\n\n Dana said suddenly, \"I named the boy Tom, after somebody I hate almost  as much as I hate you.\"\n\n\n Eudalia laid down her fork with a clatter and regarded Dana  disapprovingly. \"Why take it out on Rog?\" she asked bluntly. \"He didn't  ask to come here any more than we did. He's got a wife back home. Maybe  you want him to fall in love with you? Maybe you're jealous because  he doesn't? Well, maybe he can't! And maybe it wouldn't work, the way  things are arranged here.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Eudalia,\" said Tennant. \"I think I can defend myself. But  she's right, Dana. We're as helpless as\u2014laboratory animals. They have  the means to make us do whatever they want.\"\n\n\n \"Rog,\" said Dana, looking suddenly scared, \"I'm sorry I snapped at you.  I know it's not your fault. I'm\u2014 changing .\"\n\n\n He shook his head. \"No, Dana, you're not changing. You're adapting. We  all are. We seem to be in a universe of different properties as well as  different dimensions. We're adjusting. I can do a thing or two myself  that seem absolutely impossible.\"\n\n\n \"Are we really in the fourth dimension?\" Dana asked. Of the three of  them, she alone had more than a high-school education.\n\n\n \"We may be in the eleventh for all I know,\" he told her. \"But I'll  settle for the fourth\u2014a fourth dimension in space, if that makes  scientific sense, because we don't seem to have moved in time. I wasn't  sure of that, though, till we got the radio.\"\n\n\n \"Why haven't they brought more of us through?\" Eudalia asked, tamping  out ashes in a tray that might have been silver.\n\n\n \"I'm not sure,\" he said thoughtfully. \"I think it's hard for them. They  have a hell of a time bringing anyone through alive, and lately they  haven't brought anyone through\u2014not alive.\"\n\n\n \"Why do they do it\u2014the other way, I mean?\" asked Dana.\n\n\n Tennant shrugged. \"I don't know. I've been thinking about it. I suppose  it's because they're pretty human.\"\n\n\n \" Human! \" Dana was outraged. \"Do you call it human to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" he said. \"They pass through their gateway to Earth at  considerable danger and, probably, expense of some kind. Some of them  don't come back. They kill those of us who put up a fight. Those who  don't\u2014or can't\u2014they bring back with them. Live or dead, we're just  laboratory specimens.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" Eudalia conceded doubtfully. Then her eyes blazed. \"But the  things they do\u2014stuffing people, mounting their heads, keeping them on  display in their\u2014their whatever they live in. You call that human,  Rog?\"\n\n\n \"Were you ever in a big-game hunter's trophy room?\" Tennant asked  quietly. \"Or in a Museum of Natural History? A zoo? A naturalist's lab?  Or even, maybe, photographed as a baby on a bear-skin rug?\"\n\n\n \"I was,\" said Olga. \"But that's not the same thing.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" he agreed. \"In the one instance, we're the hunters,  the breeders, the trophy collectors. In the other\"\u2014he shrugged\u2014\"we're  the trophies.\" There was a long silence. They finished eating and then Dana stood up  and said, \"I'm going out on the lawn for a while.\" She unzipped her  golden gown, stepped out of it to reveal a pair of tartan shorts that  matched his, and a narrow halter.\n\n\n \"You thought those up while we ate,\" he said. It annoyed him to be  copied, though he did not know why. She laughed at him silently, tossed  her auburn hair back from her face and went out of the roofless house,  holding the gold dress casually over her bare arm.\n\n\n Eudalia took him to the nursery. He was irritated now in another,  angrier way. The infants, protected by cellophane-like coverlets, were  asleep.\n\n\n \"They never cry,\" the thin woman told him. \"But they grow\u2014God, how  they grow!\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Tennant, fighting down his anger. He kissed her, held  her close, although neither of them felt desire at the moment. Their  captors had seen to that; it wasn't Eudalia's turn. Tennant said, \"I  wish I could do something about this. I hate seeing Dana so bitter and  Olga so scared. It isn't their fault.\"\n\n\n \"And it's not yours,\" insisted Eudalia. \"Don't let them make you think  it is.\"\n\n\n \"I'll try not to,\" he said and stopped, realizing the family party was  over. He had felt the inner tug of command, said good-by to the women  and returned to his smaller compound within its own barrier dome.\n\n\n Then came the invisible aura of strain in the air, the shimmering  illusion of heat that was not heat, that was prelude to his  teleportation ... if that were the word. It was neither pleasant nor  unpleasant; it was , that was all.\n\n\n He called it the training hall, not because it looked like a training  hall but because that was its function. It didn't actually look like  anything save some half-nourished dream a surrealist might have  discarded as too nightmarish for belief.\n\n\n As in all of this strange universe, excepting the dome-cages in  which the captives were held, the training hall followed no rules of  three-dimensional space. One wall looked normal for perhaps a third of  its length, then it simply wasn't for a bit. It came back farther on  at an impossible angle. Yet, walking along it, touching it, it felt  perfectly smooth and continuously straight.\n\n\n The opposite wall resembled a diagonal cross-section of an asymmetrical  dumbbell\u2014that was the closest Tennant could come to it in words. And  it, too, felt straight. The floor looked like crystal smashed by some  cosmic impact, yet it had reason. He knew this even though no reason  was apparent to his three-dimensional vision. The ceiling, where he  could see it, was beyond description.\n\n\n The captor Tennant called Opal came in through a far corner of  the ceiling. He\u2014if it was a he\u2014was not large, although this,  Tennant knew, meant nothing; Opal might extend thousands of yards in  some unseen direction. He had no regular shape and much of him was  iridescent and shot with constantly changing colors. Hence the name  Opal.\n\n\n Communication was telepathic. Tennant could have yodeled or yelled  or sung Mississippi Mud and Opal would have shown no reaction. Yet  Tennant suspected that the captors could hear somewhere along the  auditory scale, just as perhaps they could smell, although not in any  human sense. You will approach without use of your appendages. The command was as clear as if it had been spoken aloud. Tennant took a  deep breath. He thought of the space beside Opal. It took about three  seconds and he was there, having spanned a distance of some ninety  feet. He was getting good at it.\n\n\n Dog does trick, he thought. He went through the entire routine at Opal's bidding. When at last  he was allowed to relax, he wondered, not for the first time, if he  weren't mastering some of the alleged Guru arts. At once he felt  probing investigation. Opal, like the rest of the captors, was as  curious as a cat\u2014or a human being. Tennant sat against a wall, drenched with sweat. There would be endless  repetition before his workout was done. On Earth, dogs were said to be  intellectually two-dimensional creatures. He wondered if they felt this  helpless futility when their masters taught them to heel, to point, to  retrieve.\n\n\n Some days later, the training routine was broken. He felt a sudden stir  of near-sick excitement as he received the thought: Now you are ready. We are going through at last. Opal was nervous, so much so that he revealed more than he intended.  Or perhaps that was his intent; Tennant could never be sure. They were  going through to Tennant's own dimension. He wondered briefly just what  his role was to be.\n\n\n He had little time to speculate before Opal seemed to envelop him.  There was the blurring wrench of forced teleportation and they were in  another room, a room which ended in a huge irregular passage that might  have been the interior of a giant concertina\u2014or an old-fashioned kodak.\n\n\n He stood before a kidney-shaped object over whose jagged surface  colors played constantly. From Opal's thoughts it appeared to be some  sort of ultradimensional television set, but to Tennant it was as  incomprehensible as an oil painting to an animal.\n\n\n Opal was annoyed that Tennant could make nothing of it. Then came the  thought: What cover must your body have not to be conspicuous? Tennant wondered, cynically, what would happen if he were to demand  a costume of mediaeval motley, complete with Pied Piper's flute. He  received quick reproof that made his head ring as from a blow.\n\n\n He asked Opal where and when they were going, was informed that  he would soon emerge on Earth where he had left it. That told him  everything but the date and season. Opal, like the rest of the captors,  seemed to have no understanding of time in a human sense.\n\n\n Waiting, Tennant tried not to think of his wife, of the fact that he  hadn't seen her in\u2014was it more than a year and a half on Earth? He  could have controlled his heartbeat with one of his new powers, but  that might have made Opal suspicious. He should be somewhat excited.  He allowed himself to be, though he obscured the reasons. He was going  to see his wife again ... and maybe he could trick his way into not  returning. The maid who opened the door for him was new, although her eyes were  old. But she recognized him and stood aside to let him enter. There  must, he thought, still be pictures of him around. He wondered how  Agatha could afford a servant.\n\n\n \"Is Mrs. Tennant in?\" he asked.\n\n\n She shook her head and fright made twin stoplights of the rouge on her  cheeks as she shut the door behind him. He went into the living room,  directly to the long silver cigarette box on the coffee table. It was  proof of homecoming to fill his lungs with smoke he could smell . He  took another drag, saw the maid still in the doorway, staring.\n\n\n \"There's no need for fright,\" he told her. \"I believe I still own this  house.\" Then, \"When do you expect Mrs. Tennant?\"\n\n\n \"She just called. She's on her way home from the club.\"\n\n\n Still looking frightened, she departed for the rear of the house.  Tennant stared after her puzzledly until the kitchen door swung shut  behind her. The club? What club?\n\n\n He shrugged, returned to the feeling of comfort that came from being  back here, about to see Agatha again, hold her close in no more than a  few minutes. And stay, his mind began to add eagerly, but he pushed the  thought down where Opal could not detect it.\n\n\n He took another deep, lung-filling drag on his cigarette, looked around  the room that was so important a part of his life. The three women back  there would be in a ghastly spot. He felt like a heel for wanting to  leave them there, then knew that he would try somehow to get them out.  Not, of course, anything that would endanger his remaining with Agatha;  the only way his captors would get him back would be as a taxidermist's  specimen.\n\n\n He realized, shocked and scared, that his thoughts of escape had  slipped past his mental censor, and he waited apprehensively for Opal  to strike. Nothing happened and he warily relaxed. Opal wasn't tapping  his thoughts. Because he felt sure of his captive ... or because he  couldn't on Earth?\n\n\n It was like being let out of a cage. Tennant grinned at the bookcase;  the ebony-and-ivory elephants that Agatha had never liked were gone,  but he'd get them back or another pair. The credenza had been replaced  by a huge and ugly television console. That, he resolved, would go down  in the cellar rumpus room, where its bleached modernity wouldn't clash  with the casual antiquity of the living room.\n\n\n Agatha would complain, naturally, but his being back would make up for  any amount of furniture shifting. He imagined her standing close to  him, her lovely face lifted to be kissed, and his heart lurched like an  adolescent's. This hunger was real, not implanted. Everything would be  real ... his love for her, the food he ate, the things he touched, his  house, his life.... Your wife and a man are approaching the house. The thought message from Opal crumbled his illusion of freedom. He sank  down in a chair, trying to refuse to listen to the rest of the command: You are to bring the man through the gateway with you. We want another  live male. Tennant shook his head, stiff and defiant in his chair. The punishment,  when it came, was more humiliating than a slap across a dog's snout.  Opal had been too interested in the next lab specimen to bother about  his thoughts\u2014that was why he had been free to think of escape.\n\n\n Tennant closed his eyes, willed himself to the front window. Now that  he had mastered teleportation, it was incredible how much easier it was  in his own world. He had covered the two miles from the gateway to the  house in a mere seven jumps, the distance to the window in an instant.  But there was no pleasure in it, only a confirmation of his captor's  power over him.\n\n\n He was not free of them. He understood all too well what they wanted  him to do; he was to play the Judas goat ... or rather the Judas ram,  leading another victim to the fourth-dimensional pen.\n\n\n Grim, he watched the swoop of headlights in the driveway and returned  to the coffee table, lit a fresh cigarette.\n\n\n The front door was flung open and his diaphragm tightened at the  remembered sound of Agatha's throaty laugh ... and tightened further  when it was followed by a deeper rumbling laugh. Sudden fear made the  cigarette shake in his fingers.\n\n\n \"... Don't be such a stuffed-shirt, darling.\" Agatha's mocking  sweetness rang alarm-gongs in Tennant's memory. \"Charley wasn't making  a grab for me . He'd had one too many and only wanted a little fun.  Really, darling, you seem to think that a girl....\"\n\n\n Her voice faded out as she saw Tennant standing there. She was wearing  a white strapless gown, had a blue-red-and-gold Mandarin jacket slung  hussar-fashion over her left shoulder. She looked even sleeker, better  groomed, more assured than his memory of her.\n\n\n \"I'm no stuffed-shirt and you know it.\" Cass' tone was peevish. \"But  your idea of fun, Agatha, is pretty damn....\"\n\n\n It was his turn to freeze. Unbelieving, Tennant studied his successor.  Cass Gordon\u2014the man , the ex-halfback whose bulk was beginning to get  out of hand, but whose inherent aggressive grace had not yet deserted  him. The man , that was all\u2014unless one threw in the little black  mustache and the smooth salesman's manner.\n\n\n \"You know, Cass,\" Tennant said quietly, \"I never for a moment dreamed  it would be you.\"\n\n\n \" Roger! \" Agatha found her voice. \"You're alive !\"\n\n\n \"Roger,\" repeated Tennant viciously. He felt sick with disgust. Maybe  he should have expected a triangle, but somehow he hadn't. And here  it was, with all of them going through their paces like a trio of  tent-show actors. He said, \"For God's sake, sit down.\"\n\n\n Agatha did so hesitantly. Her huge dark eyes, invariably clear  and limpid no matter how much she had drunk, flickered toward him  furtively. She said defensively, \"I had detectives looking for you for  six months. Where have you been, Rog? Smashing up the car like that  and\u2014disappearing! I've been out of my mind.\"\n\n\n \"Sorry,\" said Tennant. \"I've had my troubles, too.\" Agatha was scared  stiff\u2014of him. Probably with reason. He looked again at Cass Gordon and  found that he suddenly didn't care. She couldn't say it was loneliness.  Women have waited longer than eighteen months. He would have if his  captors had let him.\n\n\n \"Where in hell have you been, Rog?\" Gordon's tone was almost  parental. \"I don't suppose it's news to you, but there was a lot of  suspicion directed your way while that crazy killer was operating  around here. Agatha and I managed to clear you.\"\n\n\n \"Decent of you,\" said Tennant. He got up, crossed to the cabinet that  served as a bar. It was fully equipped\u2014with more expensive liquor, he  noticed, than he had ever been able to afford. He poured a drink of  brandy, waited for the others to fill their glasses. Agatha looked at him over the rim of hers. \"Tell us, Rog. We have a  right to know. I do, anyway.\"\n\n\n \"One question first,\" he said. \"What about those killings? Have there  been any lately?\"\n\n\n \"Not for over a year,\" Cass told him. \"They never did get the devil who  skinned those bodies and removed the heads.\"\n\n\n So, Tennant thought, they hadn't used the gateway. Not since they had  brought the four of them through, not since they had begun to train him  for his Judas ram duties.\n\n\n Agatha was asking him if he had been abroad.\n\n\n \"In a way,\" he replied unemotionally. \"Sorry if I've worried you,  Agatha, but my life has been rather\u2014indefinite, since I\u2014left.\"\n\n\n He was standing no more than four inches from this woman he had desired  desperately for six years, and he no longer wanted her. He was acutely  conscious of her perfume. It wrapped them both like an exotic blanket,  and it repelled him. He studied the firm clear flesh of her cheek and  chin, the arch of nostril, the carmine fullness of lower lip, the  swell of bosom above low-cut gown. And he no longer wanted any of it or  of her. Cass Gordon\u2014\n\n\n It didn't have to be anybody at all. For it to be Cass Gordon was  revolting.\n\n\n \"Rog,\" she said and her voice trembled, \"what are we going to do? What  do you want to do?\"\n\n\n Take her back? He smiled ironically; she wouldn't know what that meant.  It would serve her right, but maybe there was another way.\n\n\n \"I don't know about you,\" he said, \"but I suspect we're in the same  boat. I also have other interests.\"\n\n\n \"You louse!\" said Cass Gordon, arching rib cage and nostrils. \"If you  try to make trouble for Agatha, I can promise....\"\n\n\n \" What can you promise?\" demanded Tennant. When Gordon's onset  subsided in mumbles, he added, \"Actually, I don't think I'm capable of  making more than a fraction of the trouble for either of you that you  both are qualified to make for yourselves.\"\n\n\n He lit a cigarette, inhaled. \"Relax. I'm not planning revenge. After  this evening, I plan to vanish for good. Of course, Agatha, that  offers you a minor nuisance. You will have to wait six years to marry  Cass\u2014seven years if the maid who let me in tonight talks. That's the  law, isn't it, Cass? You probably had it all figured out.\"\n\n\n \"You bastard,\" said Cass. \"You dirty bastard! You know what a wait like  that could do to us.\"\n\n\n \"Tristan and Isolde,\" said Tennant, grinning almost happily. \"Well,  I've had my little say. Now I'm off again. Cass, would you give me a  lift? I have a conveyance of sorts a couple of miles down the road.\" He needed no telepathic powers to read the thoughts around him then. He  heard Agatha's quick intake of breath, saw the split-second look she  exchanged with Cass. He turned away, knowing that she was imploring her  lover to do something, anything , as long as it was safe.\n\n\n Deliberately, Tennant poured himself a second drink. This might be  easier and pleasanter than he had expected. They deserved some of the  suffering he had had and there was a chance that they might get it.\n\n\n Tennant knew now why he was the only male human the captors had been  able to take alive. Apparently, thanks to the rain-slick road, he had  run the sedan into a tree at the foot of the hill beyond the river. He  had been sitting there, unconscious, ripe fruit on their doorstep. They  had simply picked him up.\n\n\n Otherwise, apparently, men were next to impossible for them to capture.  All they could do was kill them and bring back their heads and hides  as trophies. With women it was different\u2014perhaps the captors' weapons,  whatever they were, worked more efficiently on females. A difference in  body chemistry or psychology, perhaps.\n\n\n More than once, during his long training with Opal, Tennant had sent  questing thoughts toward his captor, asking why they didn't simply set  up the gateway in some town or city and take as many humans as they  wanted.\n\n\n Surprisingly there had been a definite fear reaction. As nearly as he  could understand, it had been like asking an African pygmy, armed with  a blowgun, to set up shop in the midst of a herd of wild elephants. It  simply wasn't feasible\u2014and furthermore he derived an impression of the  tenuosity as well as the immovability of the gateway itself.\n\n\n They could be hurt, even killed by humans in a three-dimensional world.  How? Tennant did not know. Perhaps as a man can cut finger or even  throat on the edge of a near-two-dimensional piece of paper. It took  valor for them to hunt men in the world of men. In that fact lay a key  to their character\u2014if such utterly alien creatures could be said to  have character. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy had Roger been trained by Opal?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"because Opal was unable to bring other men back\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"because Opal wanted to further his experiment\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"because Opal wanted to further his experiment\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"because Opal wanted to further his experiment\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If it only\n\n had a lease that could be broken\u2014 Roger Tennant, crossing the lawn, could see two of the three wings  of the house, which radiated spoke-like from its heptagonal central  portion. The wing on the left was white, with slim square pillars,  reminiscent of scores of movie sets of the Deep South. That on the  right was sundeck solar-house living-machine modern, something like a  montage of shoeboxes. The wing hidden by the rest of the house was, he  knew, spired, gabled and multicolored, like an ancient building in  pre-Hitler Cracow. Dana was lying under a tree near the door, stretched out on a sort  of deck chair with her eyes closed. She wore a golden gown, long and  close-fitting and slit up the leg like the gown of a Chinese woman.  Above it her comely face was sullen beneath its sleek cocoon of auburn  hair.\n\n\n She opened her eyes at his approach and regarded him with nothing like  favor. Involuntarily he glanced down at the tartan shorts that were his  only garment to make sure that they were on properly. They were. He had  thought them up in a moment of utter boredom and they were extremely  comfortable. However, the near-Buchanan tartan did not crease or even  wrinkle when he moved. Their captors had no idea of how a woven design  should behave.\n\n\n \"Waiting for me?\" Tennant asked the girl.\n\n\n She said, \"I'd rather be dead. Maybe I am. Maybe we're all dead and  this is Hell.\"\n\n\n He stood over her and looked down until she turned away her reddening  face. He said, \"So it's going to be you again, Dana. You'll be the  first to come back for a second run.\"\n\n\n \"Don't flatter yourself,\" she replied angrily. She sat up, pushed  back her hair, got to her feet a trifle awkwardly because of the  tight-fitting tubular gown. \"If I could do anything about it....\"\n\n\n \"But you can't,\" he told her. \"They're too clever.\"\n\n\n \"Is this crop rotation or did you send for me?\" she asked cynically.  \"If you did, I wish you hadn't. You haven't asked about your son.\"\n\n\n \"I don't even want to think about him,\" said Tennant. \"Let's get  on with it.\" He could sense the restless stirring of the woman  within Dana, just as he could feel the stirring toward her within  himself\u2014desire that both of them loathed because it was implanted  within them by their captors.\n\n\n They walked toward the house. It didn't look like a prison\u2014or a cage. Within the dome of the  barrier, it looked more like a well-kept if bizarre little country  estate. There was clipped lawn, a scattering of trees, even a clear  little brook that chattered unending annoyance at the small stones  which impeded its flow.\n\n\n But the lawn was not of grass\u2014it was of a bright green substance that  might have been cellophane but wasn't, and it sprouted from a fabric  that might have been canvas but was something else. The trees looked  like trees, only their trunks were bark all the way through\u2014except  that it was not bark. The brook was practically water, but the small  stones over which it flowed were of no earthly mineral.\n\n\n They entered the house, which had no roof, continued to move beneath a  sky that glowed with light which did not come from a sun or moon. It  might have been a well-kept if bizarre little country estate, but it  wasn't. It was a prison, a cage.\n\n\n The other two women were sitting in the heptagonal central hall.  Eudalia, who had borne twin girls recently, was lying back, newly thin  and dark of skin and hair, smoking a scentless cigarette. A tall woman,  thirtyish, she wore a sort of shimmering green strapless evening gown.  Tennant wondered how she maintained it in place, for despite her recent  double motherhood, she was almost flat of bosom. He asked her how she  was feeling.\n\n\n \"Okay, I guess,\" she said. \"The way they manage it, there's nothing  to it.\" She had a flat, potentially raucous voice. Eudalia had been  a female foreman in a garment-cutting shop before being captured and  brought through.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said. \"Glad to hear it.\" He felt oddly embarrassed. He  turned to Olga, broad, blonde and curiously vital, who sat perfectly  still, regarding him over the pregnant swell of her dirndl-clad waist.  Olga had been a waitress in a mining town hash-house near Scranton.\n\n\n Tennant wanted to put an encouraging hand on her shoulder, to say  something that might cheer her up, for she was by far the youngest of  the three female captives, barely nineteen. But with the eyes of the  other two, especially Dana, upon him, he could not.\n\n\n \"I guess I wasn't cut out to be a Turk,\" he said. \"I don't feel at ease  in a harem, even when it's supposedly my own.\"\n\n\n \"You're not doing so badly,\" Dana replied acidly.\n\n\n \"Lay off\u2014he can't help it,\" said Eudalia unexpectedly. \"He doesn't  like it any better than we do.\"\n\n\n \"But he doesn't have to\u2014have them,\" objected Olga. She had a trace of  Polish accent that was not unpleasant. In fact, Tennant thought, only  her laughter was unpleasant, a shrill, uncontrolled burst of staccato  sound that jarred him to his heels. Olga had not laughed of late,  however. She was too frightened. \"Let's get the meal ordered,\" said Dana and they were all silent,  thinking of what they wanted to eat but would not enjoy when it came.  Tennant finished with his order, then got busy with his surprise.\n\n\n It arrived before the meal, materializing against one of the seven  walls of the roofless chamber. It was a large cabinet on slender  straight legs that resembled dark polished wood. Tennant went to it,  opened a hingeless door and pushed a knob on the inner surface. At once  the air was hideous with the acerate harmony of a singing commercial....\n\n... so go soak your head, be it gold, brown or red, in Any-tone Shampoo!\n\n A disc jockey's buoyant tones cut in quickly as the final ooooo faded. \"This is Grady Martin, your old night-owl, coming to you with  your requests over Station WZZX, Manhattan. Here's a wire from Theresa  McManus and the girls in the family entrance of Conaghan's Bar and  Grill on West....\"\n\n\n Tennant watched the girls as a sweet-voiced crooner began to ply  an unfamiliar love lyric to a melody whose similarity to a thousand  predecessors doomed it to instant success.\n\n\n Olga sat up straight, her pale blue eyes round with utter disbelief.  She looked at the radio, at Tennant, at the other two women, then back  at the machine. She murmured something in Polish that was inaudible,  but her expression showed that it must have been wistful.\n\n\n Eudalia grinned at Tennant and, rising, did a sort of tap dance to the  music, then whirled back into her chair, green dress ashimmer, and sank  into it just to listen.\n\n\n Dana stood almost in the center of the room, carmine-tipped fingers  clasped beneath the swell of her breasts. She might have been listening  to Brahms or Debussy. Her eyes glowed with the salty brilliance of  emotion and she was almost beautiful.\n\n\n \" Rog! \" she cried softly when the music stopped. \"A radio and WZZX! Is  it\u2014are they\u2014real?\"\n\n\n \"As real as you or I,\" he told her. \"It took quite a bit of doing,  getting them to put a set together. And I wasn't sure that radio would  get through. TV doesn't seem to. Somehow it brings things closer....\"\n\n\n Olga got up quite suddenly, went to the machine and, after frowning at  it for a moment, tuned in another station from which a Polish-speaking  announcer was followed by polka music. She leaned against the wall,  resting one smooth forearm on the top of the machine. Her eyes closed  and she swayed a little in time to the polka beat. Tennant caught Dana looking at him and there was near approval in her  expression\u2014approval that faded quickly as soon as she caught his gaze  upon her. The food arrived then and they sat down at the round table to  eat it.\n\n\n Tennant's meat looked like steak, it felt like steak, but, lacking the  aroma of steak, it was almost tasteless. This was so with all of their  foods, with their cigarettes, with everything in their prison\u2014or their  cage. Their captors were utterly without a human conception of smell,  living, apparently, in a world without odor at all.\n\n\n Dana said suddenly, \"I named the boy Tom, after somebody I hate almost  as much as I hate you.\"\n\n\n Eudalia laid down her fork with a clatter and regarded Dana  disapprovingly. \"Why take it out on Rog?\" she asked bluntly. \"He didn't  ask to come here any more than we did. He's got a wife back home. Maybe  you want him to fall in love with you? Maybe you're jealous because  he doesn't? Well, maybe he can't! And maybe it wouldn't work, the way  things are arranged here.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Eudalia,\" said Tennant. \"I think I can defend myself. But  she's right, Dana. We're as helpless as\u2014laboratory animals. They have  the means to make us do whatever they want.\"\n\n\n \"Rog,\" said Dana, looking suddenly scared, \"I'm sorry I snapped at you.  I know it's not your fault. I'm\u2014 changing .\"\n\n\n He shook his head. \"No, Dana, you're not changing. You're adapting. We  all are. We seem to be in a universe of different properties as well as  different dimensions. We're adjusting. I can do a thing or two myself  that seem absolutely impossible.\"\n\n\n \"Are we really in the fourth dimension?\" Dana asked. Of the three of  them, she alone had more than a high-school education.\n\n\n \"We may be in the eleventh for all I know,\" he told her. \"But I'll  settle for the fourth\u2014a fourth dimension in space, if that makes  scientific sense, because we don't seem to have moved in time. I wasn't  sure of that, though, till we got the radio.\"\n\n\n \"Why haven't they brought more of us through?\" Eudalia asked, tamping  out ashes in a tray that might have been silver.\n\n\n \"I'm not sure,\" he said thoughtfully. \"I think it's hard for them. They  have a hell of a time bringing anyone through alive, and lately they  haven't brought anyone through\u2014not alive.\"\n\n\n \"Why do they do it\u2014the other way, I mean?\" asked Dana.\n\n\n Tennant shrugged. \"I don't know. I've been thinking about it. I suppose  it's because they're pretty human.\"\n\n\n \" Human! \" Dana was outraged. \"Do you call it human to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" he said. \"They pass through their gateway to Earth at  considerable danger and, probably, expense of some kind. Some of them  don't come back. They kill those of us who put up a fight. Those who  don't\u2014or can't\u2014they bring back with them. Live or dead, we're just  laboratory specimens.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" Eudalia conceded doubtfully. Then her eyes blazed. \"But the  things they do\u2014stuffing people, mounting their heads, keeping them on  display in their\u2014their whatever they live in. You call that human,  Rog?\"\n\n\n \"Were you ever in a big-game hunter's trophy room?\" Tennant asked  quietly. \"Or in a Museum of Natural History? A zoo? A naturalist's lab?  Or even, maybe, photographed as a baby on a bear-skin rug?\"\n\n\n \"I was,\" said Olga. \"But that's not the same thing.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" he agreed. \"In the one instance, we're the hunters,  the breeders, the trophy collectors. In the other\"\u2014he shrugged\u2014\"we're  the trophies.\" There was a long silence. They finished eating and then Dana stood up  and said, \"I'm going out on the lawn for a while.\" She unzipped her  golden gown, stepped out of it to reveal a pair of tartan shorts that  matched his, and a narrow halter.\n\n\n \"You thought those up while we ate,\" he said. It annoyed him to be  copied, though he did not know why. She laughed at him silently, tossed  her auburn hair back from her face and went out of the roofless house,  holding the gold dress casually over her bare arm.\n\n\n Eudalia took him to the nursery. He was irritated now in another,  angrier way. The infants, protected by cellophane-like coverlets, were  asleep.\n\n\n \"They never cry,\" the thin woman told him. \"But they grow\u2014God, how  they grow!\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Tennant, fighting down his anger. He kissed her, held  her close, although neither of them felt desire at the moment. Their  captors had seen to that; it wasn't Eudalia's turn. Tennant said, \"I  wish I could do something about this. I hate seeing Dana so bitter and  Olga so scared. It isn't their fault.\"\n\n\n \"And it's not yours,\" insisted Eudalia. \"Don't let them make you think  it is.\"\n\n\n \"I'll try not to,\" he said and stopped, realizing the family party was  over. He had felt the inner tug of command, said good-by to the women  and returned to his smaller compound within its own barrier dome.\n\n\n Then came the invisible aura of strain in the air, the shimmering  illusion of heat that was not heat, that was prelude to his  teleportation ... if that were the word. It was neither pleasant nor  unpleasant; it was , that was all.\n\n\n He called it the training hall, not because it looked like a training  hall but because that was its function. It didn't actually look like  anything save some half-nourished dream a surrealist might have  discarded as too nightmarish for belief.\n\n\n As in all of this strange universe, excepting the dome-cages in  which the captives were held, the training hall followed no rules of  three-dimensional space. One wall looked normal for perhaps a third of  its length, then it simply wasn't for a bit. It came back farther on  at an impossible angle. Yet, walking along it, touching it, it felt  perfectly smooth and continuously straight.\n\n\n The opposite wall resembled a diagonal cross-section of an asymmetrical  dumbbell\u2014that was the closest Tennant could come to it in words. And  it, too, felt straight. The floor looked like crystal smashed by some  cosmic impact, yet it had reason. He knew this even though no reason  was apparent to his three-dimensional vision. The ceiling, where he  could see it, was beyond description.\n\n\n The captor Tennant called Opal came in through a far corner of  the ceiling. He\u2014if it was a he\u2014was not large, although this,  Tennant knew, meant nothing; Opal might extend thousands of yards in  some unseen direction. He had no regular shape and much of him was  iridescent and shot with constantly changing colors. Hence the name  Opal.\n\n\n Communication was telepathic. Tennant could have yodeled or yelled  or sung Mississippi Mud and Opal would have shown no reaction. Yet  Tennant suspected that the captors could hear somewhere along the  auditory scale, just as perhaps they could smell, although not in any  human sense. You will approach without use of your appendages. The command was as clear as if it had been spoken aloud. Tennant took a  deep breath. He thought of the space beside Opal. It took about three  seconds and he was there, having spanned a distance of some ninety  feet. He was getting good at it.\n\n\n Dog does trick, he thought. He went through the entire routine at Opal's bidding. When at last  he was allowed to relax, he wondered, not for the first time, if he  weren't mastering some of the alleged Guru arts. At once he felt  probing investigation. Opal, like the rest of the captors, was as  curious as a cat\u2014or a human being. Tennant sat against a wall, drenched with sweat. There would be endless  repetition before his workout was done. On Earth, dogs were said to be  intellectually two-dimensional creatures. He wondered if they felt this  helpless futility when their masters taught them to heel, to point, to  retrieve.\n\n\n Some days later, the training routine was broken. He felt a sudden stir  of near-sick excitement as he received the thought: Now you are ready. We are going through at last. Opal was nervous, so much so that he revealed more than he intended.  Or perhaps that was his intent; Tennant could never be sure. They were  going through to Tennant's own dimension. He wondered briefly just what  his role was to be.\n\n\n He had little time to speculate before Opal seemed to envelop him.  There was the blurring wrench of forced teleportation and they were in  another room, a room which ended in a huge irregular passage that might  have been the interior of a giant concertina\u2014or an old-fashioned kodak.\n\n\n He stood before a kidney-shaped object over whose jagged surface  colors played constantly. From Opal's thoughts it appeared to be some  sort of ultradimensional television set, but to Tennant it was as  incomprehensible as an oil painting to an animal.\n\n\n Opal was annoyed that Tennant could make nothing of it. Then came the  thought: What cover must your body have not to be conspicuous? Tennant wondered, cynically, what would happen if he were to demand  a costume of mediaeval motley, complete with Pied Piper's flute. He  received quick reproof that made his head ring as from a blow.\n\n\n He asked Opal where and when they were going, was informed that  he would soon emerge on Earth where he had left it. That told him  everything but the date and season. Opal, like the rest of the captors,  seemed to have no understanding of time in a human sense.\n\n\n Waiting, Tennant tried not to think of his wife, of the fact that he  hadn't seen her in\u2014was it more than a year and a half on Earth? He  could have controlled his heartbeat with one of his new powers, but  that might have made Opal suspicious. He should be somewhat excited.  He allowed himself to be, though he obscured the reasons. He was going  to see his wife again ... and maybe he could trick his way into not  returning. The maid who opened the door for him was new, although her eyes were  old. But she recognized him and stood aside to let him enter. There  must, he thought, still be pictures of him around. He wondered how  Agatha could afford a servant.\n\n\n \"Is Mrs. Tennant in?\" he asked.\n\n\n She shook her head and fright made twin stoplights of the rouge on her  cheeks as she shut the door behind him. He went into the living room,  directly to the long silver cigarette box on the coffee table. It was  proof of homecoming to fill his lungs with smoke he could smell . He  took another drag, saw the maid still in the doorway, staring.\n\n\n \"There's no need for fright,\" he told her. \"I believe I still own this  house.\" Then, \"When do you expect Mrs. Tennant?\"\n\n\n \"She just called. She's on her way home from the club.\"\n\n\n Still looking frightened, she departed for the rear of the house.  Tennant stared after her puzzledly until the kitchen door swung shut  behind her. The club? What club?\n\n\n He shrugged, returned to the feeling of comfort that came from being  back here, about to see Agatha again, hold her close in no more than a  few minutes. And stay, his mind began to add eagerly, but he pushed the  thought down where Opal could not detect it.\n\n\n He took another deep, lung-filling drag on his cigarette, looked around  the room that was so important a part of his life. The three women back  there would be in a ghastly spot. He felt like a heel for wanting to  leave them there, then knew that he would try somehow to get them out.  Not, of course, anything that would endanger his remaining with Agatha;  the only way his captors would get him back would be as a taxidermist's  specimen.\n\n\n He realized, shocked and scared, that his thoughts of escape had  slipped past his mental censor, and he waited apprehensively for Opal  to strike. Nothing happened and he warily relaxed. Opal wasn't tapping  his thoughts. Because he felt sure of his captive ... or because he  couldn't on Earth?\n\n\n It was like being let out of a cage. Tennant grinned at the bookcase;  the ebony-and-ivory elephants that Agatha had never liked were gone,  but he'd get them back or another pair. The credenza had been replaced  by a huge and ugly television console. That, he resolved, would go down  in the cellar rumpus room, where its bleached modernity wouldn't clash  with the casual antiquity of the living room.\n\n\n Agatha would complain, naturally, but his being back would make up for  any amount of furniture shifting. He imagined her standing close to  him, her lovely face lifted to be kissed, and his heart lurched like an  adolescent's. This hunger was real, not implanted. Everything would be  real ... his love for her, the food he ate, the things he touched, his  house, his life.... Your wife and a man are approaching the house. The thought message from Opal crumbled his illusion of freedom. He sank  down in a chair, trying to refuse to listen to the rest of the command: You are to bring the man through the gateway with you. We want another  live male. Tennant shook his head, stiff and defiant in his chair. The punishment,  when it came, was more humiliating than a slap across a dog's snout.  Opal had been too interested in the next lab specimen to bother about  his thoughts\u2014that was why he had been free to think of escape.\n\n\n Tennant closed his eyes, willed himself to the front window. Now that  he had mastered teleportation, it was incredible how much easier it was  in his own world. He had covered the two miles from the gateway to the  house in a mere seven jumps, the distance to the window in an instant.  But there was no pleasure in it, only a confirmation of his captor's  power over him.\n\n\n He was not free of them. He understood all too well what they wanted  him to do; he was to play the Judas goat ... or rather the Judas ram,  leading another victim to the fourth-dimensional pen.\n\n\n Grim, he watched the swoop of headlights in the driveway and returned  to the coffee table, lit a fresh cigarette.\n\n\n The front door was flung open and his diaphragm tightened at the  remembered sound of Agatha's throaty laugh ... and tightened further  when it was followed by a deeper rumbling laugh. Sudden fear made the  cigarette shake in his fingers.\n\n\n \"... Don't be such a stuffed-shirt, darling.\" Agatha's mocking  sweetness rang alarm-gongs in Tennant's memory. \"Charley wasn't making  a grab for me . He'd had one too many and only wanted a little fun.  Really, darling, you seem to think that a girl....\"\n\n\n Her voice faded out as she saw Tennant standing there. She was wearing  a white strapless gown, had a blue-red-and-gold Mandarin jacket slung  hussar-fashion over her left shoulder. She looked even sleeker, better  groomed, more assured than his memory of her.\n\n\n \"I'm no stuffed-shirt and you know it.\" Cass' tone was peevish. \"But  your idea of fun, Agatha, is pretty damn....\"\n\n\n It was his turn to freeze. Unbelieving, Tennant studied his successor.  Cass Gordon\u2014the man , the ex-halfback whose bulk was beginning to get  out of hand, but whose inherent aggressive grace had not yet deserted  him. The man , that was all\u2014unless one threw in the little black  mustache and the smooth salesman's manner.\n\n\n \"You know, Cass,\" Tennant said quietly, \"I never for a moment dreamed  it would be you.\"\n\n\n \" Roger! \" Agatha found her voice. \"You're alive !\"\n\n\n \"Roger,\" repeated Tennant viciously. He felt sick with disgust. Maybe  he should have expected a triangle, but somehow he hadn't. And here  it was, with all of them going through their paces like a trio of  tent-show actors. He said, \"For God's sake, sit down.\"\n\n\n Agatha did so hesitantly. Her huge dark eyes, invariably clear  and limpid no matter how much she had drunk, flickered toward him  furtively. She said defensively, \"I had detectives looking for you for  six months. Where have you been, Rog? Smashing up the car like that  and\u2014disappearing! I've been out of my mind.\"\n\n\n \"Sorry,\" said Tennant. \"I've had my troubles, too.\" Agatha was scared  stiff\u2014of him. Probably with reason. He looked again at Cass Gordon and  found that he suddenly didn't care. She couldn't say it was loneliness.  Women have waited longer than eighteen months. He would have if his  captors had let him.\n\n\n \"Where in hell have you been, Rog?\" Gordon's tone was almost  parental. \"I don't suppose it's news to you, but there was a lot of  suspicion directed your way while that crazy killer was operating  around here. Agatha and I managed to clear you.\"\n\n\n \"Decent of you,\" said Tennant. He got up, crossed to the cabinet that  served as a bar. It was fully equipped\u2014with more expensive liquor, he  noticed, than he had ever been able to afford. He poured a drink of  brandy, waited for the others to fill their glasses. Agatha looked at him over the rim of hers. \"Tell us, Rog. We have a  right to know. I do, anyway.\"\n\n\n \"One question first,\" he said. \"What about those killings? Have there  been any lately?\"\n\n\n \"Not for over a year,\" Cass told him. \"They never did get the devil who  skinned those bodies and removed the heads.\"\n\n\n So, Tennant thought, they hadn't used the gateway. Not since they had  brought the four of them through, not since they had begun to train him  for his Judas ram duties.\n\n\n Agatha was asking him if he had been abroad.\n\n\n \"In a way,\" he replied unemotionally. \"Sorry if I've worried you,  Agatha, but my life has been rather\u2014indefinite, since I\u2014left.\"\n\n\n He was standing no more than four inches from this woman he had desired  desperately for six years, and he no longer wanted her. He was acutely  conscious of her perfume. It wrapped them both like an exotic blanket,  and it repelled him. He studied the firm clear flesh of her cheek and  chin, the arch of nostril, the carmine fullness of lower lip, the  swell of bosom above low-cut gown. And he no longer wanted any of it or  of her. Cass Gordon\u2014\n\n\n It didn't have to be anybody at all. For it to be Cass Gordon was  revolting.\n\n\n \"Rog,\" she said and her voice trembled, \"what are we going to do? What  do you want to do?\"\n\n\n Take her back? He smiled ironically; she wouldn't know what that meant.  It would serve her right, but maybe there was another way.\n\n\n \"I don't know about you,\" he said, \"but I suspect we're in the same  boat. I also have other interests.\"\n\n\n \"You louse!\" said Cass Gordon, arching rib cage and nostrils. \"If you  try to make trouble for Agatha, I can promise....\"\n\n\n \" What can you promise?\" demanded Tennant. When Gordon's onset  subsided in mumbles, he added, \"Actually, I don't think I'm capable of  making more than a fraction of the trouble for either of you that you  both are qualified to make for yourselves.\"\n\n\n He lit a cigarette, inhaled. \"Relax. I'm not planning revenge. After  this evening, I plan to vanish for good. Of course, Agatha, that  offers you a minor nuisance. You will have to wait six years to marry  Cass\u2014seven years if the maid who let me in tonight talks. That's the  law, isn't it, Cass? You probably had it all figured out.\"\n\n\n \"You bastard,\" said Cass. \"You dirty bastard! You know what a wait like  that could do to us.\"\n\n\n \"Tristan and Isolde,\" said Tennant, grinning almost happily. \"Well,  I've had my little say. Now I'm off again. Cass, would you give me a  lift? I have a conveyance of sorts a couple of miles down the road.\" He needed no telepathic powers to read the thoughts around him then. He  heard Agatha's quick intake of breath, saw the split-second look she  exchanged with Cass. He turned away, knowing that she was imploring her  lover to do something, anything , as long as it was safe.\n\n\n Deliberately, Tennant poured himself a second drink. This might be  easier and pleasanter than he had expected. They deserved some of the  suffering he had had and there was a chance that they might get it.\n\n\n Tennant knew now why he was the only male human the captors had been  able to take alive. Apparently, thanks to the rain-slick road, he had  run the sedan into a tree at the foot of the hill beyond the river. He  had been sitting there, unconscious, ripe fruit on their doorstep. They  had simply picked him up.\n\n\n Otherwise, apparently, men were next to impossible for them to capture.  All they could do was kill them and bring back their heads and hides  as trophies. With women it was different\u2014perhaps the captors' weapons,  whatever they were, worked more efficiently on females. A difference in  body chemistry or psychology, perhaps.\n\n\n More than once, during his long training with Opal, Tennant had sent  questing thoughts toward his captor, asking why they didn't simply set  up the gateway in some town or city and take as many humans as they  wanted.\n\n\n Surprisingly there had been a definite fear reaction. As nearly as he  could understand, it had been like asking an African pygmy, armed with  a blowgun, to set up shop in the midst of a herd of wild elephants. It  simply wasn't feasible\u2014and furthermore he derived an impression of the  tenuosity as well as the immovability of the gateway itself.\n\n\n They could be hurt, even killed by humans in a three-dimensional world.  How? Tennant did not know. Perhaps as a man can cut finger or even  throat on the edge of a near-two-dimensional piece of paper. It took  valor for them to hunt men in the world of men. In that fact lay a key  to their character\u2014if such utterly alien creatures could be said to  have character. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy had Roger been trained by Opal?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"because Opal was unable to bring other men back\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"because Opal wanted to further his experiment\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"because Opal wanted to further his experiment\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"because Opal wanted to further his experiment\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
