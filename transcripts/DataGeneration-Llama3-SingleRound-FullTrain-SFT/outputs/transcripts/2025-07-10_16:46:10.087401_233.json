      "background_text": "STAR MOTHER By ROBERT F. YOUNG A touching story of the most  enduring love in all eternity. That  night her son was the  first star.\n\n\n She stood motionless in the  garden, one hand pressed against  her heart, watching him rise  above the fields where he had  played as a boy, where he had  worked as a young man; and she  wondered whether he was thinking  of those fields now, whether  he was thinking of her standing  alone in the April night with her  memories; whether he was  thinking of the verandahed  house behind her, with its empty  rooms and silent halls, that once  upon a time had been his birthplace.\n\n\n Higher still and higher he  rose in the southern sky, and  then, when he had reached his  zenith, he dropped swiftly down  past the dark edge of the Earth  and disappeared from sight. A  boy grown up too soon, riding  round and round the world on  a celestial carousel, encased in  an airtight metal capsule in an  airtight metal chariot ... Why don't they leave the stars  alone? she thought. Why don't  they leave the stars to God? The general's second telegram  came early the next morning:  Explorer XII doing splendidly.  Expect to bring your son down  sometime tomorrow .\n\n\n She went about her work as  usual, collecting the eggs and  allocating them in their cardboard  boxes, then setting off in  the station wagon on her Tuesday  morning run. She had expected  a deluge of questions  from her customers. She was not  disappointed. \"Is Terry really  way up there all alone, Martha?\"  \"Aren't you scared , Martha?\" \"I  do hope they can get him back  down all right, Martha.\" She  supposed it must have given  them quite a turn to have their  egg woman change into a star  mother overnight.\n\n\n She hadn't expected the TV interview,  though, and she would  have avoided it if it had been  politely possible. But what could  she do when the line of cars and  trucks pulled into the drive and  the technicians got out and started  setting up their equipment in  the backyard? What could she  say when the suave young man  came up to her and said, \"We  want you to know that we're all  very proud of your boy up there,  ma'am, and we hope you'll do us  the honor of answering a few  questions.\"\n\n\n Most of the questions concerned  Terry, as was fitting.  From the way the suave young  man asked them, though, she got  the impression that he was trying  to prove that her son was  just like any other average  American boy, and such just  didn't happen to be the case. But  whenever she opened her mouth  to mention, say, how he used to  study till all hours of the night,  or how difficult it had been for  him to make friends because of  his shyness, or the fact that he  had never gone out for football\u2014whenever  she started to mention  any of these things, the  suave young man was in great  haste to interrupt her and to  twist her words, by requestioning,  into a different meaning  altogether, till Terry's behavior  pattern seemed to coincide with  the behavior pattern which the  suave young man apparently considered  the norm, but which, if  followed, Martha was sure,  would produce not young men  bent on exploring space but  young men bent on exploring  trivia.\n\n\n A few of the questions concerned  herself: Was Terry her  only child? (\"Yes.\") What had  happened to her husband? (\"He  was killed in the Korean War.\")  What did she think of the new  law granting star mothers top  priority on any and all information  relating to their sons? (\"I  think it's a fine law ... It's too  bad they couldn't have shown  similar humanity toward the  war mothers of World War II.\") It was late in the afternoon  by the time the TV crew got  everything repacked into their  cars and trucks and made their  departure. Martha fixed herself  a light supper, then donned an  old suede jacket of Terry's and  went out into the garden to wait  for the sun to go down. According  to the time table the general  had outlined in his first telegram,  Terry's first Tuesday  night passage wasn't due to occur  till 9:05. But it seemed only  right that she should be outside  when the stars started to come  out. Presently they did, and she  watched them wink on, one by  one, in the deepening darkness  of the sky. She'd never been  much of a one for the stars;  most of her life she'd been much  too busy on Earth to bother with  things celestial. She could remember,  when she was much  younger and Bill was courting  her, looking up at the moon  sometimes; and once in a while,  when a star fell, making a wish.  But this was different. It was  different because now she had  a personal interest in the sky, a  new affinity with its myriad inhabitants.\n\n\n And how bright they became  when you kept looking at them!  They seemed to come alive, almost,  pulsing brilliantly down  out of the blackness of the night ...  And they were different colors,  too, she noticed with a start.  Some of them were blue and  some were red, others were yellow  ... green ... orange ...\n\n\n It grew cold in the April garden  and she could see her breath.  There was a strange crispness,  a strange clarity about the  night, that she had never known  before ... She glanced at her  watch, was astonished to see that  the hands indicated two minutes  after nine. Where had the time  gone? Tremulously she faced the  southern horizon ... and saw  her Terry appear in his shining  chariot, riding up the star-pebbled  path of his orbit, a star in  his own right, dropping swiftly  now, down, down, and out of  sight beyond the dark wheeling  mass of the Earth ... She took  a deep, proud breath, realized  that she was wildly waving her  hand and let it fall slowly to her  side. Make a wish! she thought,  like a little girl, and she wished  him pleasant dreams and a safe  return and wrapped the wish in  all her love and cast it starward. Sometime tomorrow, the general's  telegram had said\u2014\n\n\n That meant sometime today!\n\n\n She rose with the sun and fed  the chickens, fixed and ate her  breakfast, collected the eggs and  put them in their cardboard  boxes, then started out on her  Wednesday morning run. \"My  land, Martha, I don't see how  you stand it with him way up  there! Doesn't it get on your nerves ?\" (\"Yes ... Yes, it  does.\") \"Martha, when are they  bringing him back down?\"  (\"Today ... Today !\") \"It must  be wonderful being a star mother,  Martha.\" (\"Yes, it is\u2014in a  way.\")\n\n\n Wonderful ... and terrible.\n\n\n If only he can last it out for  a few more hours, she thought.  If only they can bring him down  safe and sound. Then the vigil  will be over, and some other  mother can take over the awesome  responsibility of having a  son become a star\u2014\n\n\n If only ... The general's third telegram  arrived that afternoon: Regret  to inform you that meteorite impact  on satellite hull severely  damaged capsule-detachment  mechanism, making ejection impossible.  Will make every effort  to find another means of accomplishing  your son's return. Terry!\u2014\n\n\n See the little boy playing beneath  the maple tree, moving his  tiny cars up and down the tiny  streets of his make-believe village;  the little boy, his fuzz of  hair gold in the sunlight, his  cherub-cheeks pink in the summer  wind\u2014 Terry!\u2014 Up the lane the blue-denimed  young man walks, swinging his  thin tanned arms, his long legs  making near-grownup strides  over the sun-seared grass; the  sky blue and bright behind him,  the song of cicada rising and  falling in the hazy September  air\u2014 Terry ... \u2014probably won't get a chance  to write you again before take-off,  but don't worry, Ma. The Explorer XII is the greatest bird  they ever built. Nothing short of  a direct meteorite hit can hurt  it, and the odds are a million to  one ... Why don't they leave the stars  alone? Why don't they leave the  stars to God? The afternoon shadows lengthened  on the lawn and the sun  grew red and swollen over the  western hills. Martha fixed supper,  tried to eat, and couldn't.  After a while, when the light  began to fade, she slipped into  Terry's jacket and went outside.\n\n\n Slowly the sky darkened and  the stars began to appear. At  length her star appeared, but its  swift passage blurred before her  eyes. Tires crunched on the  gravel then, and headlights  washed the darkness from the  drive. A car door slammed.\n\n\n Martha did not move. Please  God , she thought, let it be Terry ,  even though she knew that it  couldn't possibly be Terry. Footsteps  sounded behind her, paused.  Someone coughed softly. She  turned then\u2014\n\n\n \"Good evening, ma'am.\"\n\n\n She saw the circlet of stars  on the gray epaulet; she saw the  stern handsome face; she saw  the dark tired eyes. And she  knew. Even before he spoke  again, she knew\u2014\n\n\n \"The same meteorite that  damaged the ejection mechanism,  ma'am. It penetrated the  capsule, too. We didn't find out  till just a while ago\u2014but there  was nothing we could have done  anyway ... Are you all right,  ma'am?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I'm all right.\"\n\n\n \"I wanted to express my regrets  personally. I know how you  must feel.\"\n\n\n \"It's all right.\"\n\n\n \"We will, of course, make  every effort to bring back his ... remains ... so  that he can  have a fitting burial on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon, ma'am?\"\n\n\n She raised her eyes to the  patch of sky where her son had  passed in his shining metal sarcophagus.  Sirius blossomed  there, blue-white and beautiful.  She raised her eyes still higher\u2014and  beheld the vast parterre  of Orion with its central motif  of vivid forget-me-nots, its far-flung  blooms of Betelguese and  Rigel, of Bellatrix and Saiph ...  And higher yet\u2014and there  flamed the exquisite flower beds  of Taurus and Gemini, there  burgeoned the riotous wreath of  the Crab; there lay the pulsing  petals of the Pleiades ... And  down the ecliptic garden path,  wafted by a stellar breeze, drifted  the ocher rose of Mars ...\n\n\n \"No,\" she said again.\n\n\n The general had raised his  eyes, too; now, slowly, he lowered  them. \"I think I understand,  ma'am. And I'm glad  that's the way you want it ...  The stars are beautiful tonight,  aren't they.\"\n\n\n \"More beautiful than they've  ever been,\" she said. After the general had gone,  she looked up once more at the  vast and variegated garden of  the sky where her son lay buried,  then she turned and walked  slowly back to the memoried  house.

YOUNG A touching story of the most  enduring love in all eternity. That  night her son was the  first star.\n\n\n She stood motionless in the  garden, one hand pressed against  her heart, watching him rise  above the fields where he had  played as a boy, where he had  worked as a young man; and she  wondered whether he was thinking  of those fields now, whether  he was thinking of her standing  alone in the April night with her  memories; whether he was  thinking of the verandahed  house behind her, with its empty  rooms and silent halls, that once  upon a time had been his birthplace.\n\n\n Higher still and higher he  rose in the southern sky, and  then, when he had reached his  zenith, he dropped swiftly down  past the dark edge of the Earth  and disappeared from sight. A  boy grown up too soon, riding  round and round the world on  a celestial carousel, encased in  an airtight metal capsule in an  airtight metal chariot ... Why don't they leave the stars  alone? she thought. Why don't  they leave the stars to God? The general's second telegram  came early the next morning:  Explorer XII doing splendidly.  Expect to bring your son down  sometime tomorrow .\n\n\n She went about her work as  usual, collecting the eggs and  allocating them in their cardboard  boxes, then setting off in  the station wagon on her Tuesday  morning run. She had expected  a deluge of questions  from her customers. She was not  disappointed. \"Is Terry really  way up there all alone, Martha?\"  \"Aren't you scared , Martha?\" \"I  do hope they can get him back  down all right, Martha.\" She  supposed it must have given  them quite a turn to have their  egg woman change into a star  mother overnight.\n\n\n She hadn't expected the TV interview,  though, and she would  have avoided it if it had been  politely possible. But what could  she do when the line of cars and  trucks pulled into the drive and  the technicians got out and started  setting up their equipment in  the backyard? What could she  say when the suave young man  came up to her and said, \"We  want you to know that we're all  very proud of your boy up there,  ma'am, and we hope you'll do us  the honor of answering a few  questions.\"\n\n\n Most of the questions concerned  Terry, as was fitting.  From the way the suave young  man asked them, though, she got  the impression that he was trying  to prove that her son was  just like any other average  American boy, and such just  didn't happen to be the case. But  whenever she opened her mouth  to mention, say, how he used to  study till all hours of the night,  or how difficult it had been for  him to make friends because of  his shyness, or the fact that he  had never gone out for football\u2014whenever  she started to mention  any of these things, the  suave young man was in great  haste to interrupt her and to  twist her words, by requestioning,  into a different meaning  altogether, till Terry's behavior  pattern seemed to coincide with  the behavior pattern which the  suave young man apparently considered  the norm, but which, if  followed, Martha was sure,  would produce not young men  bent on exploring space but  young men bent on exploring  trivia.\n\n\n A few of the questions concerned  herself: Was Terry her  only child? (\"Yes.\") What had  happened to her husband? (\"He  was killed in the Korean War.\")  What did she think of the new  law granting star mothers top  priority on any and all information  relating to their sons? (\"I  think it's a fine law ... It's too  bad they couldn't have shown  similar humanity toward the  war mothers of World War II.\") It was late in the afternoon  by the time the TV crew got  everything repacked into their  cars and trucks and made their  departure. Martha fixed herself  a light supper, then donned an  old suede jacket of Terry's and  went out into the garden to wait  for the sun to go down. According  to the time table the general  had outlined in his first telegram,  Terry's first Tuesday  night passage wasn't due to occur  till 9:05. But it seemed only  right that she should be outside  when the stars started to come  out. Presently they did, and she  watched them wink on, one by  one, in the deepening darkness  of the sky. She'd never been  much of a one for the stars;  most of her life she'd been much  too busy on Earth to bother with  things celestial. She could remember,  when she was much  younger and Bill was courting  her, looking up at the moon  sometimes; and once in a while,  when a star fell, making a wish.  But this was different. It was  different because now she had  a personal interest in the sky, a  new affinity with its myriad inhabitants.\n\n\n And how bright they became  when you kept looking at them!  They seemed to come alive, almost,  pulsing brilliantly down  out of the blackness of the night ...  And they were different colors,  too, she noticed with a start.  Some of them were blue and  some were red, others were yellow  ... green ... orange ...\n\n\n It grew cold in the April garden  and she could see her breath.  There was a strange crispness,  a strange clarity about the  night, that she had never known  before ... She glanced at her  watch, was astonished to see that  the hands indicated two minutes  after nine. Where had the time  gone? Tremulously she faced the  southern horizon ... and saw  her Terry appear in his shining  chariot, riding up the star-pebbled  path of his orbit, a star in  his own right, dropping swiftly  now, down, down, and out of  sight beyond the dark wheeling  mass of the Earth ... She took  a deep, proud breath, realized  that she was wildly waving her  hand and let it fall slowly to her  side. Make a wish! she thought,  like a little girl, and she wished  him pleasant dreams and a safe  return and wrapped the wish in  all her love and cast it starward. Sometime tomorrow, the general's  telegram had said\u2014\n\n\n That meant sometime today!\n\n\n She rose with the sun and fed  the chickens, fixed and ate her  breakfast, collected the eggs and  put them in their cardboard  boxes, then started out on her  Wednesday morning run. \"My  land, Martha, I don't see how  you stand it with him way up  there! Doesn't it get on your nerves ?\" (\"Yes ... Yes, it  does.\") \"Martha, when are they  bringing him back down?\"  (\"Today ... Today !\") \"It must  be wonderful being a star mother,  Martha.\" (\"Yes, it is\u2014in a  way.\")\n\n\n Wonderful ... and terrible.\n\n\n If only he can last it out for  a few more hours, she thought.  If only they can bring him down  safe and sound. Then the vigil  will be over, and some other  mother can take over the awesome  responsibility of having a  son become a star\u2014\n\n\n If only ... The general's third telegram  arrived that afternoon: Regret  to inform you that meteorite impact  on satellite hull severely  damaged capsule-detachment  mechanism, making ejection impossible.  Will make every effort  to find another means of accomplishing  your son's return. Terry!\u2014\n\n\n See the little boy playing beneath  the maple tree, moving his  tiny cars up and down the tiny  streets of his make-believe village;  the little boy, his fuzz of  hair gold in the sunlight, his  cherub-cheeks pink in the summer  wind\u2014 Terry!\u2014 Up the lane the blue-denimed  young man walks, swinging his  thin tanned arms, his long legs  making near-grownup strides  over the sun-seared grass; the  sky blue and bright behind him,  the song of cicada rising and  falling in the hazy September  air\u2014 Terry ... \u2014probably won't get a chance  to write you again before take-off,  but don't worry, Ma. The Explorer XII is the greatest bird  they ever built. Nothing short of  a direct meteorite hit can hurt  it, and the odds are a million to  one ... Why don't they leave the stars  alone? Why don't they leave the  stars to God? The afternoon shadows lengthened  on the lawn and the sun  grew red and swollen over the  western hills. Martha fixed supper,  tried to eat, and couldn't.  After a while, when the light  began to fade, she slipped into  Terry's jacket and went outside.\n\n\n Slowly the sky darkened and  the stars began to appear. At  length her star appeared, but its  swift passage blurred before her  eyes. Tires crunched on the  gravel then, and headlights  washed the darkness from the  drive. A car door slammed.\n\n\n Martha did not move. Please  God , she thought, let it be Terry ,  even though she knew that it  couldn't possibly be Terry. Footsteps  sounded behind her, paused.  Someone coughed softly. She  turned then\u2014\n\n\n \"Good evening, ma'am.\"\n\n\n She saw the circlet of stars  on the gray epaulet; she saw the  stern handsome face; she saw  the dark tired eyes. And she  knew. Even before he spoke  again, she knew\u2014\n\n\n \"The same meteorite that  damaged the ejection mechanism,  ma'am. It penetrated the  capsule, too. We didn't find out  till just a while ago\u2014but there  was nothing we could have done  anyway ... Are you all right,  ma'am?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I'm all right.\"\n\n\n \"I wanted to express my regrets  personally. I know how you  must feel.\"\n\n\n \"It's all right.\"\n\n\n \"We will, of course, make  every effort to bring back his ... remains ... so  that he can  have a fitting burial on Earth.\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon, ma'am?\"\n\n\n She raised her eyes to the  patch of sky where her son had  passed in his shining metal sarcophagus.  Sirius blossomed  there, blue-white and beautiful.  She raised her eyes still higher\u2014and  beheld the vast parterre  of Orion with its central motif  of vivid forget-me-nots, its far-flung  blooms of Betelguese and  Rigel, of Bellatrix and Saiph ...  And higher yet\u2014and there  flamed the exquisite flower beds  of Taurus and Gemini, there  burgeoned the riotous wreath of  the Crab; there lay the pulsing  petals of the Pleiades ... And  down the ecliptic garden path,  wafted by a stellar breeze, drifted  the ocher rose of Mars ...\n\n\n \"No,\" she said again.\n\n\n The general had raised his  eyes, too; now, slowly, he lowered  them. \"I think I understand,  ma'am. And I'm glad  that's the way you want it ...  The stars are beautiful tonight,  aren't they.\"\n\n\n \"More beautiful than they've  ever been,\" she said. After the general had gone,  she looked up once more at the  vast and variegated garden of  the sky where her son lay buried,  then she turned and walked  slowly back to the memoried  house.
