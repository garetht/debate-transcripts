      "background_text": "IN CASE OF FIRE By RANDALL GARRETT There are times when a broken tool is better  than a sound one, or a twisted personality  more useful than a whole one. For  instance, a whole beer bottle isn't half  the weapon that half a beer bottle is ... Illustrated by Martinez In his  office apartment,  on the top floor of the  Terran Embassy Building  in Occeq City, Bertrand  Malloy leafed  casually through the dossiers of the  four new men who had been assigned  to him. They were typical of the kind  of men who were sent to him, he  thought. Which meant, as usual, that  they were atypical. Every man in the  Diplomatic Corps who developed a  twitch or a quirk was shipped to  Saarkkad IV to work under Bertrand  Malloy, Permanent Terran Ambassador  to His Utter Munificence, the  Occeq of Saarkkad.\n\n\n Take this first one, for instance.  Malloy ran his finger down the columns  of complex symbolism that  showed the complete psychological  analysis of the man. Psychopathic  paranoia. The man wasn't technically  insane; he could be as lucid as the next  man most of the time. But he was  morbidly suspicious that every man's  hand was turned against him. He  trusted no one, and was perpetually  on his guard against imaginary plots  and persecutions.\n\n\n Number two suffered from some  sort of emotional block that left him  continually on the horns of one dilemma  or another. He was psychologically  incapable of making a decision  if he were faced with two or more  possible alternatives of any major  importance.\n\n\n Number three ...\n\n\n Malloy sighed and pushed the dossiers  away from him. No two men  were alike, and yet there sometimes  seemed to be an eternal sameness  about all men. He considered himself  an individual, for instance, but wasn't  the basic similarity there, after all?\n\n\n He was\u2014how old? He glanced at  the Earth calendar dial that was automatically  correlated with the Saarkkadic  calendar just above it. Fifty-nine  next week. Fifty-nine years old. And  what did he have to show for it besides  flabby muscles, sagging skin, a  wrinkled face, and gray hair?\n\n\n Well, he had an excellent record in  the Corps, if nothing else. One of the  top men in his field. And he had his  memories of Diane, dead these ten  years, but still beautiful and alive in  his recollections. And\u2014he grinned  softly to himself\u2014he had Saarkkad.\n\n\n He glanced up at the ceiling, and  mentally allowed his gaze to penetrate  it to the blue sky beyond it.\n\n\n Out there was the terrible emptiness  of interstellar space\u2014a great, yawning,  infinite chasm capable of swallowing  men, ships, planets, suns, and  whole galaxies without filling its insatiable  void.\n\n\n Malloy closed his eyes. Somewhere  out there, a war was raging. He  didn't even like to think of that, but  it was necessary to keep it in mind.  Somewhere out there, the ships of  Earth were ranged against the ships  of the alien Karna in the most important  war that Mankind had yet  fought.\n\n\n And, Malloy knew, his own position  was not unimportant in that war.  He was not in the battle line, nor  even in the major production line, but  it was necessary to keep the drug supply  lines flowing from Saarkkad, and  that meant keeping on good terms  with the Saarkkadic government.\n\n\n The Saarkkada themselves were humanoid  in physical form\u2014if one allowed  the term to cover a wide range  of differences\u2014but their minds just  didn't function along the same lines.\n\n\n For nine years, Bertrand Malloy  had been Ambassador to Saarkkad,  and for nine years, no Saarkkada had  ever seen him. To have shown himself  to one of them would have  meant instant loss of prestige.\n\n\n To their way of thinking, an important  official was aloof. The greater  his importance, the greater must be  his isolation. The Occeq of Saarkkad  himself was never seen except by a  handful of picked nobles, who, themselves,  were never seen except by their  underlings. It was a long, roundabout  way of doing business, but it was the  only way Saarkkad would do any  business at all. To violate the rigid  social setup of Saarkkad would mean  the instant closing off of the supply  of biochemical products that the  Saarkkadic laboratories produced  from native plants and animals\u2014products  that were vitally necessary  to Earth's war, and which could be  duplicated nowhere else in the  known universe.\n\n\n It was Bertrand Malloy's job to  keep the production output high and  to keep the materiel flowing towards  Earth and her allies and outposts.\n\n\n The job would have been a snap  cinch in the right circumstances; the  Saarkkada weren't difficult to get  along with. A staff of top-grade men  could have handled them without  half trying.\n\n\n But Malloy didn't have top-grade  men. They couldn't be spared from  work that required their total capacity.  It's inefficient to waste a man on a  job that he can do without half trying  where there are more important jobs  that will tax his full output.\n\n\n So Malloy was stuck with the culls.  Not the worst ones, of course; there  were places in the galaxy that were  less important than Saarkkad to the  war effort. Malloy knew that, no matter  what was wrong with a man, as  long as he had the mental ability to  dress himself and get himself to  work, useful work could be found for  him.\n\n\n Physical handicaps weren't at all  difficult to deal with. A blind man can  work very well in the total darkness  of an infrared-film darkroom. Partial  or total losses of limbs can be compensated  for in one way or another.\n\n\n The mental disabilities were harder  to deal with, but not totally impossible.  On a world without liquor, a  dipsomaniac could be channeled easily  enough; and he'd better not try fermenting  his own on Saarkkad unless  he brought his own yeast\u2014which  was impossible, in view of the sterilization  regulations.\n\n\n But Malloy didn't like to stop at  merely thwarting mental quirks; he  liked to find places where they were useful . The phone chimed. Malloy flipped  it on with a practiced hand.\n\n\n \"Malloy here.\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Malloy?\" said a careful voice.  \"A special communication for you has  been teletyped in from Earth. Shall I  bring it in?\"\n\n\n \"Bring it in, Miss Drayson.\"\n\n\n Miss Drayson was a case in point.  She was uncommunicative. She liked  to gather in information, but she  found it difficult to give it up once it  was in her possession.\n\n\n Malloy had made her his private  secretary. Nothing\u2014but nothing \u2014got  out of Malloy's office without his  direct order. It had taken Malloy a  long time to get it into Miss Drayson's  head that it was perfectly all  right\u2014even desirable\u2014for her to  keep secrets from everyone except  Malloy.\n\n\n She came in through the door,  a rather handsome woman in her middle  thirties, clutching a sheaf of  papers in her right hand as though  someone might at any instant snatch  it from her before she could turn it  over to Malloy.\n\n\n She laid them carefully on the  desk. \"If anything else comes in, I'll  let you know immediately, sir,\" she  said. \"Will there be anything else?\"\n\n\n Malloy let her stand there while he  picked up the communique. She wanted  to know what his reaction was  going to be; it didn't matter because  no one would ever find out from her  what he had done unless she was  ordered to tell someone.\n\n\n He read the first paragraph, and his  eyes widened involuntarily.\n\n\n \"Armistice,\" he said in a low  whisper. \"There's a chance that the  war may be over.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" said Miss Drayson in a  hushed voice.\n\n\n Malloy read the whole thing  through, fighting to keep his emotions  in check. Miss Drayson stood  there calmly, her face a mask; her  emotions were a secret.\n\n\n Finally, Malloy looked up. \"I'll let  you know as soon as I reach a decision,  Miss Drayson. I think I hardly  need say that no news of this is to  leave this office.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not, sir.\"\n\n\n Malloy watched her go out the door  without actually seeing her. The war  was over\u2014at least for a while. He  looked down at the papers again.\n\n\n The Karna, slowly being beaten  back on every front, were suing for  peace. They wanted an armistice conference\u2014immediately.\n\n\n Earth was willing. Interstellar war  is too costly to allow it to continue  any longer than necessary, and this  one had been going on for more than  thirteen years now. Peace was necessary.  But not peace at any price.\n\n\n The trouble was that the Karna had  a reputation for losing wars and winning  at the peace table. They were  clever, persuasive talkers. They could  twist a disadvantage to an advantage,  and make their own strengths look  like weaknesses. If they won the armistice,  they'd be able to retrench and  rearm, and the war would break out  again within a few years.\n\n\n Now\u2014at this point in time\u2014they  could be beaten. They could be forced  to allow supervision of the production  potential, forced to disarm, rendered  impotent. But if the armistice went to  their own advantage ...\n\n\n Already, they had taken the offensive  in the matter of the peace talks.  They had sent a full delegation to  Saarkkad V, the next planet out from  the Saarkkad sun, a chilly world inhabited  only by low-intelligence animals.  The Karna considered this to be  fully neutral territory, and Earth  couldn't argue the point very well. In  addition, they demanded that the conference  begin in three days, Terrestrial  time.\n\n\n The trouble was that interstellar  communication beams travel a devil  of a lot faster than ships. It would  take more than a week for the Earth  government to get a vessel to Saarkkad  V. Earth had been caught unprepared  for an armistice. They  objected.\n\n\n The Karna pointed out that the  Saarkkad sun was just as far from  Karn as it was from Earth, that it  was only a few million miles from a  planet which was allied with Earth,  and that it was unfair for Earth to  take so much time in preparing for an  armistice. Why hadn't Earth been prepared?  Did they intend to fight to the  utter destruction of Karn?\n\n\n It wouldn't have been a problem at  all if Earth and Karn had fostered the  only two intelligent races in the galaxy.  The sort of grandstanding the  Karna were putting on had to be  played to an audience. But there were  other intelligent races throughout the  galaxy, most of whom had remained  as neutral as possible during the  Earth-Karn war. They had no intention  of sticking their figurative noses  into a battle between the two most  powerful races in the galaxy.\n\n\n But whoever won the armistice  would find that some of the now-neutral  races would come in on their  side if war broke out again. If the  Karna played their cards right, their  side would be strong enough next  time to win.\n\n\n So Earth had to get a delegation to  meet with the Karna representatives  within the three-day limit or lose what  might be a vital point in the negotiations.\n\n\n And that was where Bertrand Malloy  came in.\n\n\n He had been appointed Minister  and Plenipotentiary Extraordinary to  the Earth-Karn peace conference.\n\n\n He looked up at the ceiling again.  \"What can I do?\" he said softly. On the second day after the arrival  of the communique, Malloy  made his decision. He flipped on his  intercom and said: \"Miss Drayson,  get hold of James Nordon and Kylen  Braynek. I want to see them both immediately.  Send Nordon in first, and  tell Braynek to wait.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And keep the recorder on. You  can file the tape later.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n Malloy knew the woman would  listen in on the intercom anyway, and  it was better to give her permission to  do so.\n\n\n James Nordon was tall, broad-shouldered,  and thirty-eight. His hair  was graying at the temples, and his  handsome face looked cool and efficient.\n\n\n Malloy waved him to a seat.\n\n\n \"Nordon, I have a job for you. It's  probably one of the most important  jobs you'll ever have in your life. It  can mean big things for you\u2014promotion  and prestige if you do it well.\"\n\n\n Nordon nodded slowly. \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n Malloy explained the problem of  the Karna peace talks.\n\n\n \"We need a man who can outthink  them,\" Malloy finished, \"and judging  from your record, I think you're that  man. It involves risk, of course. If  you make the wrong decisions, your  name will be mud back on Earth. But  I don't think there's much chance of  that, really. Do you want to handle  small-time operations all your life?  Of course not.\n\n\n \"You'll be leaving within an hour  for Saarkkad V.\"\n\n\n Nordon nodded again. \"Yes, sir;  certainly. Am I to go alone?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" said Malloy, \"I'm sending  an assistant with you\u2014a man named  Kylen Braynek. Ever heard of him?\"\n\n\n Nordon shook his head. \"Not that  I recall, Mr. Malloy. Should I have?\"\n\n\n \"Not necessarily. He's a pretty  shrewd operator, though. He knows a  lot about interstellar law, and he's  capable of spotting a trap a mile away.  You'll be in charge, of course, but I  want you to pay special attention to  his advice.\"\n\n\n \"I will, sir,\" Nordon said gratefully.  \"A man like that can be useful.\"\n\n\n \"Right. Now, you go into the anteroom  over there. I've prepared a summary  of the situation, and you'll have  to study it and get it into your head  before the ship leaves. That isn't  much time, but it's the Karna who are  doing the pushing, not us.\"\n\n\n As soon as Nordon had left, Malloy  said softly: \"Send in Braynek,  Miss Drayson.\"\n\n\n Kylen Braynek was a smallish man  with mouse-brown hair that lay flat  against his skull, and hard, penetrating,  dark eyes that were shadowed by  heavy, protruding brows. Malloy asked  him to sit down.\n\n\n Again Malloy went through the explanation  of the peace conference.\n\n\n \"Naturally, they'll be trying to  trick you every step of the way,\" Malloy  went on. \"They're shrewd and  underhanded; we'll simply have to  be more shrewd and more underhanded.  Nordon's job is to sit  quietly and evaluate the data; yours  will be to find the loopholes they're  laying out for themselves and plug  them. Don't antagonize them, but  don't baby them, either. If you see  anything underhanded going on, let  Nordon know immediately.\"\n\n\n \"They won't get anything by me,  Mr. Malloy.\" By the time the ship from Earth  got there, the peace conference had  been going on for four days. Bertrand  Malloy had full reports on the whole  parley, as relayed to him through the  ship that had taken Nordon and Braynek  to Saarkkad V.\n\n\n Secretary of State Blendwell stopped  off at Saarkkad IV before going  on to V to take charge of the conference.  He was a tallish, lean man with  a few strands of gray hair on the top  of his otherwise bald scalp, and he  wore a hearty, professional smile that  didn't quite make it to his calculating  eyes.\n\n\n He took Malloy's hand and shook  it warmly. \"How are you, Mr. Ambassador?\"\n\n\n \"Fine, Mr. Secretary. How's everything  on Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Tense. They're waiting to see  what is going to happen on Five. So  am I, for that matter.\" His eyes were  curious. \"You decided not to go  yourself, eh?\"\n\n\n \"I thought it better not to. I sent a  good team, instead. Would you like  to see the reports?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly would.\"\n\n\n Malloy handed them to the secretary,  and as he read, Malloy watched  him. Blendwell was a political appointee\u2014a  good man, Malloy had to  admit, but he didn't know all the  ins and outs of the Diplomatic Corps.\n\n\n When Blendwell looked up from  the reports at last, he said: \"Amazing!  They've held off the Karna at  every point! They've beaten them  back! They've managed to cope with  and outdo the finest team of negotiators  the Karna could send.\"\n\n\n \"I thought they would,\" said Malloy,  trying to appear modest.\n\n\n The secretary's eyes narrowed.  \"I've heard of the work you've been  doing here with ... ah ... sick men.  Is this one of your ... ah ... successes?\"\n\n\n Malloy nodded. \"I think so. The  Karna put us in a dilemma, so I  threw a dilemma right back at them.\"\n\n\n \"How do you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Nordon had a mental block  against making decisions. If he took  a girl out on a date, he'd have trouble  making up his mind whether to kiss  her or not until she made up his mind  for him, one way or the other. He's  that kind of guy. Until he's presented  with one, single, clear decision which  admits of no alternatives, he can't  move at all.\n\n\n \"As you can see, the Karna tried  to give us several choices on each  point, and they were all rigged. Until  they backed down to a single point  and proved that it wasn't rigged,  Nordon couldn't possibly make up his  mind. I drummed into him how important  this was, and the more importance  there is attached to his decisions,  the more incapable he becomes  of making them.\"\n\n\n The Secretary nodded slowly.  \"What about Braynek?\"\n\n\n \"Paranoid,\" said Malloy. \"He  thinks everyone is plotting against  him. In this case, that's all to the good  because the Karna are plotting against  him. No matter what they put forth,  Braynek is convinced that there's a  trap in it somewhere, and he digs to  find out what the trap is. Even if  there isn't a trap, the Karna can't  satisfy Braynek, because he's convinced  that there has to be\u2014somewhere.  As a result, all his advice to  Nordon, and all his questioning on  the wildest possibilities, just serves  to keep Nordon from getting unconfused.\n\n\n \"These two men are honestly doing  their best to win at the peace conference,  and they've got the Karna reeling.  The Karna can see that we're not  trying to stall; our men are actually  working at trying to reach a decision.  But what the Karna don't see is that  those men, as a team, are unbeatable  because, in this situation, they're psychologically  incapable of losing.\"\n\n\n Again the Secretary of State nodded  his approval, but there was still  a question in his mind. \"Since you  know all that, couldn't you have handled  it yourself?\"\n\n\n \"Maybe, but I doubt it. They might  have gotten around me someway by  sneaking up on a blind spot. Nordon  and Braynek have blind spots, but  they're covered with armor. No, I'm  glad I couldn't go; it's better this  way.\"\n\n\n The Secretary of State raised an  eyebrow. \" Couldn't go, Mr. Ambassador?\"\n\n\n Malloy looked at him. \"Didn't you  know? I wondered why you appointed  me, in the first place. No, I  couldn't go. The reason why I'm here,  cooped up in this office, hiding from  the Saarkkada the way a good Saarkkadic  bigshot should, is because I like it that way. I suffer from agoraphobia  and xenophobia.\n\n\n \"I have to be drugged to be put on  a spaceship because I can't take all  that empty space, even if I'm protected  from it by a steel shell.\" A  look of revulsion came over his face.  \"And I can't stand aliens!\" THE END Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Astounding Science Fiction March 1960.

For  instance, a whole beer bottle isn't half  the weapon that half a beer bottle is ... Illustrated by Martinez In his  office apartment,  on the top floor of the  Terran Embassy Building  in Occeq City, Bertrand  Malloy leafed  casually through the dossiers of the  four new men who had been assigned  to him. They were typical of the kind  of men who were sent to him, he  thought. Which meant, as usual, that  they were atypical. Every man in the  Diplomatic Corps who developed a  twitch or a quirk was shipped to  Saarkkad IV to work under Bertrand  Malloy, Permanent Terran Ambassador  to His Utter Munificence, the  Occeq of Saarkkad.\n\n\n Take this first one, for instance.  Malloy ran his finger down the columns  of complex symbolism that  showed the complete psychological  analysis of the man. Psychopathic  paranoia. The man wasn't technically  insane; he could be as lucid as the next  man most of the time. But he was  morbidly suspicious that every man's  hand was turned against him. He  trusted no one, and was perpetually  on his guard against imaginary plots  and persecutions.\n\n\n Number two suffered from some  sort of emotional block that left him  continually on the horns of one dilemma  or another. He was psychologically  incapable of making a decision  if he were faced with two or more  possible alternatives of any major  importance.\n\n\n Number three ...\n\n\n Malloy sighed and pushed the dossiers  away from him. No two men  were alike, and yet there sometimes  seemed to be an eternal sameness  about all men. He considered himself  an individual, for instance, but wasn't  the basic similarity there, after all?\n\n\n He was\u2014how old? He glanced at  the Earth calendar dial that was automatically  correlated with the Saarkkadic  calendar just above it. Fifty-nine  next week. Fifty-nine years old. And  what did he have to show for it besides  flabby muscles, sagging skin, a  wrinkled face, and gray hair?\n\n\n Well, he had an excellent record in  the Corps, if nothing else. One of the  top men in his field. And he had his  memories of Diane, dead these ten  years, but still beautiful and alive in  his recollections. And\u2014he grinned  softly to himself\u2014he had Saarkkad.\n\n\n He glanced up at the ceiling, and  mentally allowed his gaze to penetrate  it to the blue sky beyond it.\n\n\n Out there was the terrible emptiness  of interstellar space\u2014a great, yawning,  infinite chasm capable of swallowing  men, ships, planets, suns, and  whole galaxies without filling its insatiable  void.\n\n\n Malloy closed his eyes. Somewhere  out there, a war was raging. He  didn't even like to think of that, but  it was necessary to keep it in mind.  Somewhere out there, the ships of  Earth were ranged against the ships  of the alien Karna in the most important  war that Mankind had yet  fought.\n\n\n And, Malloy knew, his own position  was not unimportant in that war.  He was not in the battle line, nor  even in the major production line, but  it was necessary to keep the drug supply  lines flowing from Saarkkad, and  that meant keeping on good terms  with the Saarkkadic government.\n\n\n The Saarkkada themselves were humanoid  in physical form\u2014if one allowed  the term to cover a wide range  of differences\u2014but their minds just  didn't function along the same lines.\n\n\n For nine years, Bertrand Malloy  had been Ambassador to Saarkkad,  and for nine years, no Saarkkada had  ever seen him. To have shown himself  to one of them would have  meant instant loss of prestige.\n\n\n To their way of thinking, an important  official was aloof. The greater  his importance, the greater must be  his isolation. The Occeq of Saarkkad  himself was never seen except by a  handful of picked nobles, who, themselves,  were never seen except by their  underlings. It was a long, roundabout  way of doing business, but it was the  only way Saarkkad would do any  business at all. To violate the rigid  social setup of Saarkkad would mean  the instant closing off of the supply  of biochemical products that the  Saarkkadic laboratories produced  from native plants and animals\u2014products  that were vitally necessary  to Earth's war, and which could be  duplicated nowhere else in the  known universe.\n\n\n It was Bertrand Malloy's job to  keep the production output high and  to keep the materiel flowing towards  Earth and her allies and outposts.\n\n\n The job would have been a snap  cinch in the right circumstances; the  Saarkkada weren't difficult to get  along with. A staff of top-grade men  could have handled them without  half trying.\n\n\n But Malloy didn't have top-grade  men. They couldn't be spared from  work that required their total capacity.  It's inefficient to waste a man on a  job that he can do without half trying  where there are more important jobs  that will tax his full output.\n\n\n So Malloy was stuck with the culls.  Not the worst ones, of course; there  were places in the galaxy that were  less important than Saarkkad to the  war effort. Malloy knew that, no matter  what was wrong with a man, as  long as he had the mental ability to  dress himself and get himself to  work, useful work could be found for  him.\n\n\n Physical handicaps weren't at all  difficult to deal with. A blind man can  work very well in the total darkness  of an infrared-film darkroom. Partial  or total losses of limbs can be compensated  for in one way or another.\n\n\n The mental disabilities were harder  to deal with, but not totally impossible.  On a world without liquor, a  dipsomaniac could be channeled easily  enough; and he'd better not try fermenting  his own on Saarkkad unless  he brought his own yeast\u2014which  was impossible, in view of the sterilization  regulations.\n\n\n But Malloy didn't like to stop at  merely thwarting mental quirks; he  liked to find places where they were useful . The phone chimed. Malloy flipped  it on with a practiced hand.\n\n\n \"Malloy here.\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Malloy?\" said a careful voice.  \"A special communication for you has  been teletyped in from Earth. Shall I  bring it in?\"\n\n\n \"Bring it in, Miss Drayson.\"\n\n\n Miss Drayson was a case in point.  She was uncommunicative. She liked  to gather in information, but she  found it difficult to give it up once it  was in her possession.\n\n\n Malloy had made her his private  secretary. Nothing\u2014but nothing \u2014got  out of Malloy's office without his  direct order. It had taken Malloy a  long time to get it into Miss Drayson's  head that it was perfectly all  right\u2014even desirable\u2014for her to  keep secrets from everyone except  Malloy.\n\n\n She came in through the door,  a rather handsome woman in her middle  thirties, clutching a sheaf of  papers in her right hand as though  someone might at any instant snatch  it from her before she could turn it  over to Malloy.\n\n\n She laid them carefully on the  desk. \"If anything else comes in, I'll  let you know immediately, sir,\" she  said. \"Will there be anything else?\"\n\n\n Malloy let her stand there while he  picked up the communique. She wanted  to know what his reaction was  going to be; it didn't matter because  no one would ever find out from her  what he had done unless she was  ordered to tell someone.\n\n\n He read the first paragraph, and his  eyes widened involuntarily.\n\n\n \"Armistice,\" he said in a low  whisper. \"There's a chance that the  war may be over.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" said Miss Drayson in a  hushed voice.\n\n\n Malloy read the whole thing  through, fighting to keep his emotions  in check. Miss Drayson stood  there calmly, her face a mask; her  emotions were a secret.\n\n\n Finally, Malloy looked up. \"I'll let  you know as soon as I reach a decision,  Miss Drayson. I think I hardly  need say that no news of this is to  leave this office.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not, sir.\"\n\n\n Malloy watched her go out the door  without actually seeing her. The war  was over\u2014at least for a while. He  looked down at the papers again.\n\n\n The Karna, slowly being beaten  back on every front, were suing for  peace. They wanted an armistice conference\u2014immediately.\n\n\n Earth was willing. Interstellar war  is too costly to allow it to continue  any longer than necessary, and this  one had been going on for more than  thirteen years now. Peace was necessary.  But not peace at any price.\n\n\n The trouble was that the Karna had  a reputation for losing wars and winning  at the peace table. They were  clever, persuasive talkers. They could  twist a disadvantage to an advantage,  and make their own strengths look  like weaknesses. If they won the armistice,  they'd be able to retrench and  rearm, and the war would break out  again within a few years.\n\n\n Now\u2014at this point in time\u2014they  could be beaten. They could be forced  to allow supervision of the production  potential, forced to disarm, rendered  impotent. But if the armistice went to  their own advantage ...\n\n\n Already, they had taken the offensive  in the matter of the peace talks.  They had sent a full delegation to  Saarkkad V, the next planet out from  the Saarkkad sun, a chilly world inhabited  only by low-intelligence animals.  The Karna considered this to be  fully neutral territory, and Earth  couldn't argue the point very well. In  addition, they demanded that the conference  begin in three days, Terrestrial  time.\n\n\n The trouble was that interstellar  communication beams travel a devil  of a lot faster than ships. It would  take more than a week for the Earth  government to get a vessel to Saarkkad  V. Earth had been caught unprepared  for an armistice. They  objected.\n\n\n The Karna pointed out that the  Saarkkad sun was just as far from  Karn as it was from Earth, that it  was only a few million miles from a  planet which was allied with Earth,  and that it was unfair for Earth to  take so much time in preparing for an  armistice. Why hadn't Earth been prepared?  Did they intend to fight to the  utter destruction of Karn?\n\n\n It wouldn't have been a problem at  all if Earth and Karn had fostered the  only two intelligent races in the galaxy.  The sort of grandstanding the  Karna were putting on had to be  played to an audience. But there were  other intelligent races throughout the  galaxy, most of whom had remained  as neutral as possible during the  Earth-Karn war. They had no intention  of sticking their figurative noses  into a battle between the two most  powerful races in the galaxy.\n\n\n But whoever won the armistice  would find that some of the now-neutral  races would come in on their  side if war broke out again. If the  Karna played their cards right, their  side would be strong enough next  time to win.\n\n\n So Earth had to get a delegation to  meet with the Karna representatives  within the three-day limit or lose what  might be a vital point in the negotiations.\n\n\n And that was where Bertrand Malloy  came in.\n\n\n He had been appointed Minister  and Plenipotentiary Extraordinary to  the Earth-Karn peace conference.\n\n\n He looked up at the ceiling again.  \"What can I do?\" he said softly. On the second day after the arrival  of the communique, Malloy  made his decision. He flipped on his  intercom and said: \"Miss Drayson,  get hold of James Nordon and Kylen  Braynek. I want to see them both immediately.  Send Nordon in first, and  tell Braynek to wait.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And keep the recorder on. You  can file the tape later.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n Malloy knew the woman would  listen in on the intercom anyway, and  it was better to give her permission to  do so.\n\n\n James Nordon was tall, broad-shouldered,  and thirty-eight. His hair  was graying at the temples, and his  handsome face looked cool and efficient.\n\n\n Malloy waved him to a seat.\n\n\n \"Nordon, I have a job for you. It's  probably one of the most important  jobs you'll ever have in your life. It  can mean big things for you\u2014promotion  and prestige if you do it well.\"\n\n\n Nordon nodded slowly. \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n Malloy explained the problem of  the Karna peace talks.\n\n\n \"We need a man who can outthink  them,\" Malloy finished, \"and judging  from your record, I think you're that  man. It involves risk, of course. If  you make the wrong decisions, your  name will be mud back on Earth. But  I don't think there's much chance of  that, really. Do you want to handle  small-time operations all your life?  Of course not.\n\n\n \"You'll be leaving within an hour  for Saarkkad V.\"\n\n\n Nordon nodded again. \"Yes, sir;  certainly. Am I to go alone?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" said Malloy, \"I'm sending  an assistant with you\u2014a man named  Kylen Braynek. Ever heard of him?\"\n\n\n Nordon shook his head. \"Not that  I recall, Mr. Malloy. Should I have?\"\n\n\n \"Not necessarily. He's a pretty  shrewd operator, though. He knows a  lot about interstellar law, and he's  capable of spotting a trap a mile away.  You'll be in charge, of course, but I  want you to pay special attention to  his advice.\"\n\n\n \"I will, sir,\" Nordon said gratefully.  \"A man like that can be useful.\"\n\n\n \"Right. Now, you go into the anteroom  over there. I've prepared a summary  of the situation, and you'll have  to study it and get it into your head  before the ship leaves. That isn't  much time, but it's the Karna who are  doing the pushing, not us.\"\n\n\n As soon as Nordon had left, Malloy  said softly: \"Send in Braynek,  Miss Drayson.\"\n\n\n Kylen Braynek was a smallish man  with mouse-brown hair that lay flat  against his skull, and hard, penetrating,  dark eyes that were shadowed by  heavy, protruding brows. Malloy asked  him to sit down.\n\n\n Again Malloy went through the explanation  of the peace conference.\n\n\n \"Naturally, they'll be trying to  trick you every step of the way,\" Malloy  went on. \"They're shrewd and  underhanded; we'll simply have to  be more shrewd and more underhanded.  Nordon's job is to sit  quietly and evaluate the data; yours  will be to find the loopholes they're  laying out for themselves and plug  them. Don't antagonize them, but  don't baby them, either. If you see  anything underhanded going on, let  Nordon know immediately.\"\n\n\n \"They won't get anything by me,  Mr. Malloy.\" By the time the ship from Earth  got there, the peace conference had  been going on for four days. Bertrand  Malloy had full reports on the whole  parley, as relayed to him through the  ship that had taken Nordon and Braynek  to Saarkkad V.\n\n\n Secretary of State Blendwell stopped  off at Saarkkad IV before going  on to V to take charge of the conference.  He was a tallish, lean man with  a few strands of gray hair on the top  of his otherwise bald scalp, and he  wore a hearty, professional smile that  didn't quite make it to his calculating  eyes.\n\n\n He took Malloy's hand and shook  it warmly. \"How are you, Mr. Ambassador?\"\n\n\n \"Fine, Mr. Secretary. How's everything  on Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Tense. They're waiting to see  what is going to happen on Five. So  am I, for that matter.\" His eyes were  curious. \"You decided not to go  yourself, eh?\"\n\n\n \"I thought it better not to. I sent a  good team, instead. Would you like  to see the reports?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly would.\"\n\n\n Malloy handed them to the secretary,  and as he read, Malloy watched  him. Blendwell was a political appointee\u2014a  good man, Malloy had to  admit, but he didn't know all the  ins and outs of the Diplomatic Corps.\n\n\n When Blendwell looked up from  the reports at last, he said: \"Amazing!  They've held off the Karna at  every point! They've beaten them  back! They've managed to cope with  and outdo the finest team of negotiators  the Karna could send.\"\n\n\n \"I thought they would,\" said Malloy,  trying to appear modest.\n\n\n The secretary's eyes narrowed.  \"I've heard of the work you've been  doing here with ... ah ... sick men.  Is this one of your ... ah ... successes?\"\n\n\n Malloy nodded. \"I think so. The  Karna put us in a dilemma, so I  threw a dilemma right back at them.\"\n\n\n \"How do you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Nordon had a mental block  against making decisions. If he took  a girl out on a date, he'd have trouble  making up his mind whether to kiss  her or not until she made up his mind  for him, one way or the other. He's  that kind of guy. Until he's presented  with one, single, clear decision which  admits of no alternatives, he can't  move at all.\n\n\n \"As you can see, the Karna tried  to give us several choices on each  point, and they were all rigged. Until  they backed down to a single point  and proved that it wasn't rigged,  Nordon couldn't possibly make up his  mind. I drummed into him how important  this was, and the more importance  there is attached to his decisions,  the more incapable he becomes  of making them.\"\n\n\n The Secretary nodded slowly.  \"What about Braynek?\"\n\n\n \"Paranoid,\" said Malloy. \"He  thinks everyone is plotting against  him. In this case, that's all to the good  because the Karna are plotting against  him. No matter what they put forth,  Braynek is convinced that there's a  trap in it somewhere, and he digs to  find out what the trap is. Even if  there isn't a trap, the Karna can't  satisfy Braynek, because he's convinced  that there has to be\u2014somewhere.  As a result, all his advice to  Nordon, and all his questioning on  the wildest possibilities, just serves  to keep Nordon from getting unconfused.\n\n\n \"These two men are honestly doing  their best to win at the peace conference,  and they've got the Karna reeling.  The Karna can see that we're not  trying to stall; our men are actually  working at trying to reach a decision.  But what the Karna don't see is that  those men, as a team, are unbeatable  because, in this situation, they're psychologically  incapable of losing.\"\n\n\n Again the Secretary of State nodded  his approval, but there was still  a question in his mind. \"Since you  know all that, couldn't you have handled  it yourself?\"\n\n\n \"Maybe, but I doubt it. They might  have gotten around me someway by  sneaking up on a blind spot. Nordon  and Braynek have blind spots, but  they're covered with armor. No, I'm  glad I couldn't go; it's better this  way.\"\n\n\n The Secretary of State raised an  eyebrow. \" Couldn't go, Mr. Ambassador?\"\n\n\n Malloy looked at him. \"Didn't you  know? I wondered why you appointed  me, in the first place. No, I  couldn't go. The reason why I'm here,  cooped up in this office, hiding from  the Saarkkada the way a good Saarkkadic  bigshot should, is because I like it that way. I suffer from agoraphobia  and xenophobia.\n\n\n \"I have to be drugged to be put on  a spaceship because I can't take all  that empty space, even if I'm protected  from it by a steel shell.\" A  look of revulsion came over his face.  \"And I can't stand aliens!\" THE END Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Astounding Science Fiction March 1960.

For  instance, a whole beer bottle isn't half  the weapon that half a beer bottle is ... Illustrated by Martinez In his  office apartment,  on the top floor of the  Terran Embassy Building  in Occeq City, Bertrand  Malloy leafed  casually through the dossiers of the  four new men who had been assigned  to him. They were typical of the kind  of men who were sent to him, he  thought. Which meant, as usual, that  they were atypical. Every man in the  Diplomatic Corps who developed a  twitch or a quirk was shipped to  Saarkkad IV to work under Bertrand  Malloy, Permanent Terran Ambassador  to His Utter Munificence, the  Occeq of Saarkkad.\n\n\n Take this first one, for instance.  Malloy ran his finger down the columns  of complex symbolism that  showed the complete psychological  analysis of the man. Psychopathic  paranoia. The man wasn't technically  insane; he could be as lucid as the next  man most of the time. But he was  morbidly suspicious that every man's  hand was turned against him. He  trusted no one, and was perpetually  on his guard against imaginary plots  and persecutions.\n\n\n Number two suffered from some  sort of emotional block that left him  continually on the horns of one dilemma  or another. He was psychologically  incapable of making a decision  if he were faced with two or more  possible alternatives of any major  importance.\n\n\n Number three ...\n\n\n Malloy sighed and pushed the dossiers  away from him. No two men  were alike, and yet there sometimes  seemed to be an eternal sameness  about all men. He considered himself  an individual, for instance, but wasn't  the basic similarity there, after all?\n\n\n He was\u2014how old? He glanced at  the Earth calendar dial that was automatically  correlated with the Saarkkadic  calendar just above it. Fifty-nine  next week. Fifty-nine years old. And  what did he have to show for it besides  flabby muscles, sagging skin, a  wrinkled face, and gray hair?\n\n\n Well, he had an excellent record in  the Corps, if nothing else. One of the  top men in his field. And he had his  memories of Diane, dead these ten  years, but still beautiful and alive in  his recollections. And\u2014he grinned  softly to himself\u2014he had Saarkkad.\n\n\n He glanced up at the ceiling, and  mentally allowed his gaze to penetrate  it to the blue sky beyond it.\n\n\n Out there was the terrible emptiness  of interstellar space\u2014a great, yawning,  infinite chasm capable of swallowing  men, ships, planets, suns, and  whole galaxies without filling its insatiable  void.\n\n\n Malloy closed his eyes. Somewhere  out there, a war was raging. He  didn't even like to think of that, but  it was necessary to keep it in mind.  Somewhere out there, the ships of  Earth were ranged against the ships  of the alien Karna in the most important  war that Mankind had yet  fought.\n\n\n And, Malloy knew, his own position  was not unimportant in that war.  He was not in the battle line, nor  even in the major production line, but  it was necessary to keep the drug supply  lines flowing from Saarkkad, and  that meant keeping on good terms  with the Saarkkadic government.\n\n\n The Saarkkada themselves were humanoid  in physical form\u2014if one allowed  the term to cover a wide range  of differences\u2014but their minds just  didn't function along the same lines.\n\n\n For nine years, Bertrand Malloy  had been Ambassador to Saarkkad,  and for nine years, no Saarkkada had  ever seen him. To have shown himself  to one of them would have  meant instant loss of prestige.\n\n\n To their way of thinking, an important  official was aloof. The greater  his importance, the greater must be  his isolation. The Occeq of Saarkkad  himself was never seen except by a  handful of picked nobles, who, themselves,  were never seen except by their  underlings. It was a long, roundabout  way of doing business, but it was the  only way Saarkkad would do any  business at all. To violate the rigid  social setup of Saarkkad would mean  the instant closing off of the supply  of biochemical products that the  Saarkkadic laboratories produced  from native plants and animals\u2014products  that were vitally necessary  to Earth's war, and which could be  duplicated nowhere else in the  known universe.\n\n\n It was Bertrand Malloy's job to  keep the production output high and  to keep the materiel flowing towards  Earth and her allies and outposts.\n\n\n The job would have been a snap  cinch in the right circumstances; the  Saarkkada weren't difficult to get  along with. A staff of top-grade men  could have handled them without  half trying.\n\n\n But Malloy didn't have top-grade  men. They couldn't be spared from  work that required their total capacity.  It's inefficient to waste a man on a  job that he can do without half trying  where there are more important jobs  that will tax his full output.\n\n\n So Malloy was stuck with the culls.  Not the worst ones, of course; there  were places in the galaxy that were  less important than Saarkkad to the  war effort. Malloy knew that, no matter  what was wrong with a man, as  long as he had the mental ability to  dress himself and get himself to  work, useful work could be found for  him.\n\n\n Physical handicaps weren't at all  difficult to deal with. A blind man can  work very well in the total darkness  of an infrared-film darkroom. Partial  or total losses of limbs can be compensated  for in one way or another.\n\n\n The mental disabilities were harder  to deal with, but not totally impossible.  On a world without liquor, a  dipsomaniac could be channeled easily  enough; and he'd better not try fermenting  his own on Saarkkad unless  he brought his own yeast\u2014which  was impossible, in view of the sterilization  regulations.\n\n\n But Malloy didn't like to stop at  merely thwarting mental quirks; he  liked to find places where they were useful . The phone chimed. Malloy flipped  it on with a practiced hand.\n\n\n \"Malloy here.\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Malloy?\" said a careful voice.  \"A special communication for you has  been teletyped in from Earth. Shall I  bring it in?\"\n\n\n \"Bring it in, Miss Drayson.\"\n\n\n Miss Drayson was a case in point.  She was uncommunicative. She liked  to gather in information, but she  found it difficult to give it up once it  was in her possession.\n\n\n Malloy had made her his private  secretary. Nothing\u2014but nothing \u2014got  out of Malloy's office without his  direct order. It had taken Malloy a  long time to get it into Miss Drayson's  head that it was perfectly all  right\u2014even desirable\u2014for her to  keep secrets from everyone except  Malloy.\n\n\n She came in through the door,  a rather handsome woman in her middle  thirties, clutching a sheaf of  papers in her right hand as though  someone might at any instant snatch  it from her before she could turn it  over to Malloy.\n\n\n She laid them carefully on the  desk. \"If anything else comes in, I'll  let you know immediately, sir,\" she  said. \"Will there be anything else?\"\n\n\n Malloy let her stand there while he  picked up the communique. She wanted  to know what his reaction was  going to be; it didn't matter because  no one would ever find out from her  what he had done unless she was  ordered to tell someone.\n\n\n He read the first paragraph, and his  eyes widened involuntarily.\n\n\n \"Armistice,\" he said in a low  whisper. \"There's a chance that the  war may be over.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" said Miss Drayson in a  hushed voice.\n\n\n Malloy read the whole thing  through, fighting to keep his emotions  in check. Miss Drayson stood  there calmly, her face a mask; her  emotions were a secret.\n\n\n Finally, Malloy looked up. \"I'll let  you know as soon as I reach a decision,  Miss Drayson. I think I hardly  need say that no news of this is to  leave this office.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not, sir.\"\n\n\n Malloy watched her go out the door  without actually seeing her. The war  was over\u2014at least for a while. He  looked down at the papers again.\n\n\n The Karna, slowly being beaten  back on every front, were suing for  peace. They wanted an armistice conference\u2014immediately.\n\n\n Earth was willing. Interstellar war  is too costly to allow it to continue  any longer than necessary, and this  one had been going on for more than  thirteen years now. Peace was necessary.  But not peace at any price.\n\n\n The trouble was that the Karna had  a reputation for losing wars and winning  at the peace table. They were  clever, persuasive talkers. They could  twist a disadvantage to an advantage,  and make their own strengths look  like weaknesses. If they won the armistice,  they'd be able to retrench and  rearm, and the war would break out  again within a few years.\n\n\n Now\u2014at this point in time\u2014they  could be beaten. They could be forced  to allow supervision of the production  potential, forced to disarm, rendered  impotent. But if the armistice went to  their own advantage ...\n\n\n Already, they had taken the offensive  in the matter of the peace talks.  They had sent a full delegation to  Saarkkad V, the next planet out from  the Saarkkad sun, a chilly world inhabited  only by low-intelligence animals.  The Karna considered this to be  fully neutral territory, and Earth  couldn't argue the point very well. In  addition, they demanded that the conference  begin in three days, Terrestrial  time.\n\n\n The trouble was that interstellar  communication beams travel a devil  of a lot faster than ships. It would  take more than a week for the Earth  government to get a vessel to Saarkkad  V. Earth had been caught unprepared  for an armistice. They  objected.\n\n\n The Karna pointed out that the  Saarkkad sun was just as far from  Karn as it was from Earth, that it  was only a few million miles from a  planet which was allied with Earth,  and that it was unfair for Earth to  take so much time in preparing for an  armistice. Why hadn't Earth been prepared?  Did they intend to fight to the  utter destruction of Karn?\n\n\n It wouldn't have been a problem at  all if Earth and Karn had fostered the  only two intelligent races in the galaxy.  The sort of grandstanding the  Karna were putting on had to be  played to an audience. But there were  other intelligent races throughout the  galaxy, most of whom had remained  as neutral as possible during the  Earth-Karn war. They had no intention  of sticking their figurative noses  into a battle between the two most  powerful races in the galaxy.\n\n\n But whoever won the armistice  would find that some of the now-neutral  races would come in on their  side if war broke out again. If the  Karna played their cards right, their  side would be strong enough next  time to win.\n\n\n So Earth had to get a delegation to  meet with the Karna representatives  within the three-day limit or lose what  might be a vital point in the negotiations.\n\n\n And that was where Bertrand Malloy  came in.\n\n\n He had been appointed Minister  and Plenipotentiary Extraordinary to  the Earth-Karn peace conference.\n\n\n He looked up at the ceiling again.  \"What can I do?\" he said softly. On the second day after the arrival  of the communique, Malloy  made his decision. He flipped on his  intercom and said: \"Miss Drayson,  get hold of James Nordon and Kylen  Braynek. I want to see them both immediately.  Send Nordon in first, and  tell Braynek to wait.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And keep the recorder on. You  can file the tape later.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n Malloy knew the woman would  listen in on the intercom anyway, and  it was better to give her permission to  do so.\n\n\n James Nordon was tall, broad-shouldered,  and thirty-eight. His hair  was graying at the temples, and his  handsome face looked cool and efficient.\n\n\n Malloy waved him to a seat.\n\n\n \"Nordon, I have a job for you. It's  probably one of the most important  jobs you'll ever have in your life. It  can mean big things for you\u2014promotion  and prestige if you do it well.\"\n\n\n Nordon nodded slowly. \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n Malloy explained the problem of  the Karna peace talks.\n\n\n \"We need a man who can outthink  them,\" Malloy finished, \"and judging  from your record, I think you're that  man. It involves risk, of course. If  you make the wrong decisions, your  name will be mud back on Earth. But  I don't think there's much chance of  that, really. Do you want to handle  small-time operations all your life?  Of course not.\n\n\n \"You'll be leaving within an hour  for Saarkkad V.\"\n\n\n Nordon nodded again. \"Yes, sir;  certainly. Am I to go alone?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" said Malloy, \"I'm sending  an assistant with you\u2014a man named  Kylen Braynek. Ever heard of him?\"\n\n\n Nordon shook his head. \"Not that  I recall, Mr. Malloy. Should I have?\"\n\n\n \"Not necessarily. He's a pretty  shrewd operator, though. He knows a  lot about interstellar law, and he's  capable of spotting a trap a mile away.  You'll be in charge, of course, but I  want you to pay special attention to  his advice.\"\n\n\n \"I will, sir,\" Nordon said gratefully.  \"A man like that can be useful.\"\n\n\n \"Right. Now, you go into the anteroom  over there. I've prepared a summary  of the situation, and you'll have  to study it and get it into your head  before the ship leaves. That isn't  much time, but it's the Karna who are  doing the pushing, not us.\"\n\n\n As soon as Nordon had left, Malloy  said softly: \"Send in Braynek,  Miss Drayson.\"\n\n\n Kylen Braynek was a smallish man  with mouse-brown hair that lay flat  against his skull, and hard, penetrating,  dark eyes that were shadowed by  heavy, protruding brows. Malloy asked  him to sit down.\n\n\n Again Malloy went through the explanation  of the peace conference.\n\n\n \"Naturally, they'll be trying to  trick you every step of the way,\" Malloy  went on. \"They're shrewd and  underhanded; we'll simply have to  be more shrewd and more underhanded.  Nordon's job is to sit  quietly and evaluate the data; yours  will be to find the loopholes they're  laying out for themselves and plug  them. Don't antagonize them, but  don't baby them, either. If you see  anything underhanded going on, let  Nordon know immediately.\"\n\n\n \"They won't get anything by me,  Mr. Malloy.\" By the time the ship from Earth  got there, the peace conference had  been going on for four days. Bertrand  Malloy had full reports on the whole  parley, as relayed to him through the  ship that had taken Nordon and Braynek  to Saarkkad V.\n\n\n Secretary of State Blendwell stopped  off at Saarkkad IV before going  on to V to take charge of the conference.  He was a tallish, lean man with  a few strands of gray hair on the top  of his otherwise bald scalp, and he  wore a hearty, professional smile that  didn't quite make it to his calculating  eyes.\n\n\n He took Malloy's hand and shook  it warmly. \"How are you, Mr. Ambassador?\"\n\n\n \"Fine, Mr. Secretary. How's everything  on Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Tense. They're waiting to see  what is going to happen on Five. So  am I, for that matter.\" His eyes were  curious. \"You decided not to go  yourself, eh?\"\n\n\n \"I thought it better not to. I sent a  good team, instead. Would you like  to see the reports?\"\n\n\n \"I certainly would.\"\n\n\n Malloy handed them to the secretary,  and as he read, Malloy watched  him. Blendwell was a political appointee\u2014a  good man, Malloy had to  admit, but he didn't know all the  ins and outs of the Diplomatic Corps.\n\n\n When Blendwell looked up from  the reports at last, he said: \"Amazing!  They've held off the Karna at  every point! They've beaten them  back! They've managed to cope with  and outdo the finest team of negotiators  the Karna could send.\"\n\n\n \"I thought they would,\" said Malloy,  trying to appear modest.\n\n\n The secretary's eyes narrowed.  \"I've heard of the work you've been  doing here with ... ah ... sick men.  Is this one of your ... ah ... successes?\"\n\n\n Malloy nodded. \"I think so. The  Karna put us in a dilemma, so I  threw a dilemma right back at them.\"\n\n\n \"How do you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Nordon had a mental block  against making decisions. If he took  a girl out on a date, he'd have trouble  making up his mind whether to kiss  her or not until she made up his mind  for him, one way or the other. He's  that kind of guy. Until he's presented  with one, single, clear decision which  admits of no alternatives, he can't  move at all.\n\n\n \"As you can see, the Karna tried  to give us several choices on each  point, and they were all rigged. Until  they backed down to a single point  and proved that it wasn't rigged,  Nordon couldn't possibly make up his  mind. I drummed into him how important  this was, and the more importance  there is attached to his decisions,  the more incapable he becomes  of making them.\"\n\n\n The Secretary nodded slowly.  \"What about Braynek?\"\n\n\n \"Paranoid,\" said Malloy. \"He  thinks everyone is plotting against  him. In this case, that's all to the good  because the Karna are plotting against  him. No matter what they put forth,  Braynek is convinced that there's a  trap in it somewhere, and he digs to  find out what the trap is. Even if  there isn't a trap, the Karna can't  satisfy Braynek, because he's convinced  that there has to be\u2014somewhere.  As a result, all his advice to  Nordon, and all his questioning on  the wildest possibilities, just serves  to keep Nordon from getting unconfused.\n\n\n \"These two men are honestly doing  their best to win at the peace conference,  and they've got the Karna reeling.  The Karna can see that we're not  trying to stall; our men are actually  working at trying to reach a decision.  But what the Karna don't see is that  those men, as a team, are unbeatable  because, in this situation, they're psychologically  incapable of losing.\"\n\n\n Again the Secretary of State nodded  his approval, but there was still  a question in his mind. \"Since you  know all that, couldn't you have handled  it yourself?\"\n\n\n \"Maybe, but I doubt it. They might  have gotten around me someway by  sneaking up on a blind spot. Nordon  and Braynek have blind spots, but  they're covered with armor. No, I'm  glad I couldn't go; it's better this  way.\"\n\n\n The Secretary of State raised an  eyebrow. \" Couldn't go, Mr. Ambassador?\"\n\n\n Malloy looked at him. \"Didn't you  know? I wondered why you appointed  me, in the first place. No, I  couldn't go. The reason why I'm here,  cooped up in this office, hiding from  the Saarkkada the way a good Saarkkadic  bigshot should, is because I like it that way. I suffer from agoraphobia  and xenophobia.\n\n\n \"I have to be drugged to be put on  a spaceship because I can't take all  that empty space, even if I'm protected  from it by a steel shell.\" A  look of revulsion came over his face.  \"And I can't stand aliens!\" THE END Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Astounding Science Fiction March 1960.
