      "background_text": "Sharism: A Mind Revolution With the People of the World Wide Web communicating more fully and  freely in Social Media while rallying a Web 2.0 content boom, the inner  dynamics of such a creative explosion must be studied more closely. What  motivates those who join this movement and what future will they create?  A key fact is that a superabundance of community respect and social  capital are being accumulated by those who share. The key motivator of  Social Media and the core spirit of Web 2.0 is a mind switch called  Sharism. Sharism suggests a re-orientation of personal values. We see it  in User Generated Content. It is the pledge of Creative Commons. It is  in the plans of future-oriented cultural initiatives. Sharism is also a  mental practice that anyone can try, a social-psychological attitude to  transform a wide and isolated world into a super-smart Social Brain. The Neuron Doctrine Sharism is encoded in the Human Genome. Although eclipsed by the many  pragmatisms of daily life, the theory of Sharism finds basis in  neuroscience and its study of the working model of the human brain.  Although we can\u2019t entirely say how the brain works as a whole, we do  have a model of the functional mechanism of the nervous system and its  neurons. A neuron is not a simple organic cell, but a very powerful,  electrically excitable biological processor. Groups of neurons form  vastly interconnected networks, which, by changing the strength of the  synapses between cells, can process information, and learn. A neuron, by  sharing chemical signals with its neighbors, can be integrated into more  meaningful patterns that keep the neuron active and alive. Moreover,  such a simple logic can be iterated and amplified, since all neurons  work on a similar principle of connecting and sharing. Originally, the  brain is quite open. A neural network exists to share activity and  information, and I believe this model of the brain should inspire ideas  and decisions about human networks. Thus, our brain supports sharing in its very system-nature. This has  profound implications for the creative process. Whenever you have an  intention to create, you will find it easier to generate more creative  ideas if you keep the sharing process firmly in mind. The  idea-forming-process is not linear, but more like an avalanche of  amplifications along the thinking path. It moves with the momentum of a  creative snowball. If your internal cognitive system encourages sharing,  you can engineer a feedback loop of happiness, which will help you  generate even more ideas in return. It\u2019s a kind of butterfly- effect, as  the small creative energy you spend will eventually return to make you,  and the world, more creative. However, daily decisions for most adults are quite low in creative  productivity, if only because they\u2019ve switched off their sharing paths.  People generally like to share what they create, but in a culture that  tells them to be protective of their ideas, people start to believe in  the danger of sharing. Then Sharism will be degraded in their mind and  not encouraged in their society. But if we can encourage someone to  share, her sharing paths will stay open. Sharism will be kept in her  mind as a memory and an instinct. If in the future she faces a creative  choice, her choice will be, \u201cShare.\u201d These mind-switches are too subtle to be felt. But since the brain, and  society, is a connected system, the accumulation of these  micro-attitudes, from neuron to neuron and person to person, can result  in observable behavior. It is easy to tell if a person, a group, a  company, a nation is oriented toward Sharism or not. For those who are  not, what they defend as \u201ccultural goods\u201d and \u201cintellectual property\u201d  are just excuses for the status quo of keeping a community closed. Much  of their \u201cculture\u201d will be protected, but the net result is the direct  loss of many other precious ideas, and the subsequent loss of all the  potential gains of sharing. This lost knowledge is a black hole in our  life, which may start to swallow other values as well. Non-sharing culture misleads us with its absolute separation of Private  and Public space. It makes creative action a binary choice between  public and private, open and closed. This creates a gap in the spectrum  of knowledge. Although this gap has the potential to become a valuable  creative space, concerns about privacy make this gap hard to fill. We  shouldn\u2019t be surprised that, to be safe, most people keep their sharing  private and stay \u201cclosed.\u201d They may fear the Internet creates a  potential for abuse that they can\u2019t fight alone. However, the paradox  is: The less you share, the less power you have. New Technologies and the Rise of Sharism Let\u2019s track back to 1999, when there were only a few hundred pioneer  bloggers around the world, and no more than ten times that many readers  following each blog. Human history is always so: something important was  happening, but the rest of the world hadn\u2019t yet realized it. The shift  toward easy-to-use online publishing triggered a soft revolution in just  five years. People made a quick and easy transition from reading blogs,  to leaving comments and taking part in online conversations, and then to  the sudden realization that they should become bloggers themselves. More  bloggers created more readers, and more readers made more blogs. The  revolution was viral. Bloggers generate lively and timely information on the Internet, and  connect to each other with RSS, hyperlinks, comments, trackbacks and  quotes. The small-scale granularity of the content can fill discrete  gaps in experience and thus record a new human history. Once you become  a blogger, once you have accumulated so much social capital in such a  small site, it\u2019s hard to stop. We can\u2019t explain this fact with a theory  of addiction. It\u2019s an impulse to share. It\u2019s the energy of the memes  that want to be passed from mouth to mouth and mind to mind. It\u2019s more  than just E-mail. It\u2019s Sharism. Bloggers are always keen to keep the social context of their posts in  mind, by asking themselves, \u201cWho is going to see this?\u201d Bloggers are  agile in adjusting their tone\u2212and privacy settings\u2212to advance ideas and  stay out of trouble. It\u2019s not self-censorship, but a sense of smart  expression. But once blogs reached the tipping point, they expanded into  the blogosphere. This required a more delicate social networking system  and content- sharing architecture. But people now understand that they  can have better control over a wide spectrum of relationships. Like how  Flickr allows people to share their photos widely, but safely. The  checkbox-based privacy of Flickr may seem unfamiliar to a new user, but  you can use it to toy with the mind-switches of Sharism. By checking a  box we can choose to share or not to share. From my observations, I have  seen photographers on Flickr become more open to sharing, while  retaining flexible choices. The rapid emergence of Social Applications that can communicate and  cooperate, by allowing people to output content from one service to  another, is letting users pump their memes into a pipeline-like  ecosystem. This interconnectedness allows memes to travel along multiple  online social networks, and potentially reach a huge audience. As a  result, such a Micro-pipeline system is making Social Media a true  alternative to broadcast media. These new technologies are reviving  Sharism in our closed culture. Local Practice, Global Gain If you happened to lose your Sharism in a bad educational or cultural  setting, it\u2019s hard to get it back. But it\u2019s not impossible. A  persistence of practice can lead to a full recovery. You can think of  Sharism as a spiritual practice. But you must practice everyday.  Otherwise, you might lose the power of sharing. Permanently. You might need something to spur you on, to keep you from quitting and  returning to a closed mindset. Here\u2019s an idea: put a sticky note on your  desk that says, \u201cWhat do you want to share today?\u201d I\u2019m not kidding.  Then, if anything interesting comes your way: Share It! The easiest way  to both start and keep sharing is by using different kinds of social  software applications. Your first meme you want to share may be small,  but you can amplify it with new technologies. Enlist some people from  your network and invite them into a new social application. At first it  might be hard to feel the gains of Sharism. The true test then is to see  if you can keep track of the feedback that you get from sharing. You  will realize that almost all sharing activities will generate positive  results. The happiness that this will obtain is only the most immediate  reward. But there are others. The first type of reward that you will get comes in the form of  comments. Then you know you\u2019ve provoked interest, appreciation,  excitement. The second reward is access to all the other stuff being  shared by friends in your network. Since you know and trust them, you  will be that much more interested in what they have to share. Already,  the return is a multiple of the small meme you first shared. But the  third type of return is more dramatic still. Anything you share can be  forwarded, circulated and republished via other people\u2019s networks. This  cascade effect can spread your work to the networked masses. Improvements in social software are making the speed of dissemination as  fast as a mouse-click. You should get to know the Sharism-You. You\u2019re  about to become popular, and fast This brings us to the fourth and final type of return. It has a meaning  not only for you, but for the whole of society. If you so choose, you  may allow others to create derivative works from what you share. This  one choice could easily snowball into more creations along the sharing  path, from people at key nodes in the network who are all as passionate  about creating and sharing as you are. After many iterative rounds of  development, a large creative work may spring from your choice to share.  Of course, you will get the credit that you asked for, and deserve. And  it\u2019s okay to seek financial rewards. But you will in every case get  something just as substantial: Happiness. The more people who create in the spirit of Sharism, the easier it will  be to attain well- balanced and equitable Social Media that is woven by  people themselves. Media won\u2019t be controlled by any single person but  will rely on the even distribution of social networking. These \u201cShaeros\u201d  (Sharing Heroes) will naturally become the opinion leaders in the first  wave of Social Media. However, these media rights will belong to  everyone. You yourself can be both producer and consumer in such a  system. Sharism Safeguards Your Rights Still, many questions will be raised about Sharism as an initiative in  new age. The main one is copyright. One concern is that any loss of  control over copyrighted content will lead to noticeable deficits in  personal wealth, or just loss of control. 5 years ago, I would have said  that this was a possibility. But things are changing today. The sharing  environment is more protected than you might think. Many new social  applications make it easy to set terms-of-use along your sharing path.  Any infringement of those terms will be challenged not just by the law,  but by your community. Your audience, who benefit form your sharing, can  also be the gatekeepers of your rights. Even if you are a traditional  copyright holder, this sounds ideal. Furthermore, by realizing all the immediate and emergent rewards that  can be had by sharing, you may eventually find that copyright and \u201cAll  Rights Reserved\u201d are far from your mind. You will enjoy sharing too much  to worry about who is keeping a copy. The new economic formula is, the  more people remix your works, the higher the return. I want to point out that Sharism is not Communism, nor Socialism. As for  those die- hard Communists we know, they have often abused people\u2019s  sharing nature and forced them to give up their rights, and their  property. Socialism, that tender Communism, in our experience also  lacked respect for these rights. Under these systems, the state owns all  property. Under Sharism, you can keep ownership, if you want. But I like  to share. And this is how I choose to spread ideas, and prosperity Sharism is totally based on your own consensus. It\u2019s not a very hard  concept to understand, especially since copyleft movements like the Free  Software Foundation and Creative Commons have been around for years.  These movements are redefining a more flexible spectrum of licenses for  both developers and end-users to tag their works. Because the new  licenses can be recognized by either humans or machines, it\u2019s becoming  easier to re-share those works in new online ecosystems. The Spirit of the Web, a Social Brain Sharism is the Spirit of the Age of Web 2.0. It has the consistency of a  naturalized Epistemology and modernized Axiology, but also promises the  power of a new Internet philosophy. Sharism will transform the world  into an emergent Social Brain: a networked hybrid of people and  software. We are Networked Neurons connected by the synapses of Social  Software. This is an evolutionary leap, a small step for us and a giant one for  human society. With new \u201chairy\u201d emergent technologies sprouting all  around us, we can generate higher connectivities and increase the  throughput of our social links. The more open and strongly connected we  social neurons are, the better the sharing environment will be for all  people. The more collective our intelligence, the wiser our actions will  be. People have always found better solutions through conversations. Now  we can put it all online. Sharism will be the politics of the next global superpower. It will not  be a country, but a new human network joined by Social Software. This  may remain a distant dream, and even a well-defined public sharing  policy might not be close at hand. But the ideas that I\u2019m discussing can  improve governments today. We can integrate our current and emerging  democratic systems with new folksonomies (based on the collaborative,  social indexing of information) to enable people to make queries, share  data and remix information for public use. The collective intelligence  of a vast and equitable sharing environment can be the gatekeeper of our  rights, and a government watchdog. In the future, policymaking can be  made more nuanced with the micro-involvement of the sharing community.  This \u201cEmergent Democracy\u201d is more real-time than periodical  parliamentary sessions. It will also increase the spectrum of our  choices, beyond the binary options of \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d referenda.  Representative democracy will become more timely and diligent, because  we will represent ourselves within the system. Sharism will result in better social justice. In a healthy sharing  environment, any evidence of injustice can get amplified to get the  public\u2019s attention. Anyone who has been abused can get real and instant  support from her peers and her peers\u2019 peers. Appeals to justice will  take the form of petitions through multiple, interconnected channels.  Using these tools, anyone can create a large social impact. With  multiple devices and many social applications, each of us can become  more sociable, and society more individual. We no longer have to act  alone. Emergent democracy will only happen when Sharism becomes the literacy of  the majority. Since Sharism can improve communication, collaboration and  mutual understanding, I believe it has a place within the educational  system. Sharism can be applied to any cultural discourse, CoP (Community  of Practice) or problem-solving context. It is also an antidote to  social depression, since sharelessness is just dragging our society  down. In present or formerly totalitarian countries, this downward cycle  is even more apparent. The future world will be a hybrid of human and  machine that will generate better and faster decisions anytime,  anywhere. The flow of information between minds will become more  flexible and more productive. These vast networks of sharing will create  a new social order\u2212A Mind Revolution! ",

Anything you share can be  forwarded, circulated and republished via other people\u2019s networks. This  cascade effect can spread your work to the networked masses. Improvements in social software are making the speed of dissemination as  fast as a mouse-click. You should get to know the Sharism-You. You\u2019re  about to become popular, and fast This brings us to the fourth and final type of return. It has a meaning  not only for you, but for the whole of society. If you so choose, you  may allow others to create derivative works from what you share. This  one choice could easily snowball into more creations along the sharing  path, from people at key nodes in the network who are all as passionate  about creating and sharing as you are. After many iterative rounds of  development, a large creative work may spring from your choice to share.  Of course, you will get the credit that you asked for, and deserve. And  it\u2019s okay to seek financial rewards. But you will in every case get  something just as substantial: Happiness. The more people who create in the spirit of Sharism, the easier it will  be to attain well- balanced and equitable Social Media that is woven by  people themselves. Media won\u2019t be controlled by any single person but  will rely on the even distribution of social networking. These \u201cShaeros\u201d  (Sharing Heroes) will naturally become the opinion leaders in the first  wave of Social Media. However, these media rights will belong to  everyone. You yourself can be both producer and consumer in such a  system. Sharism Safeguards Your Rights Still, many questions will be raised about Sharism as an initiative in  new age. The main one is copyright. One concern is that any loss of  control over copyrighted content will lead to noticeable deficits in  personal wealth, or just loss of control. 5 years ago, I would have said  that this was a possibility. But things are changing today. The sharing  environment is more protected than you might think. Many new social  applications make it easy to set terms-of-use along your sharing path.  Any infringement of those terms will be challenged not just by the law,  but by your community. Your audience, who benefit form your sharing, can  also be the gatekeepers of your rights. Even if you are a traditional  copyright holder, this sounds ideal. Furthermore, by realizing all the immediate and emergent rewards that  can be had by sharing, you may eventually find that copyright and \u201cAll  Rights Reserved\u201d are far from your mind. You will enjoy sharing too much  to worry about who is keeping a copy. The new economic formula is, the  more people remix your works, the higher the return. I want to point out that Sharism is not Communism, nor Socialism. As for  those die- hard Communists we know, they have often abused people\u2019s  sharing nature and forced them to give up their rights, and their  property. Socialism, that tender Communism, in our experience also  lacked respect for these rights. Under these systems, the state owns all  property. Under Sharism, you can keep ownership, if you want. But I like  to share. And this is how I choose to spread ideas, and prosperity Sharism is totally based on your own consensus. It\u2019s not a very hard  concept to understand, especially since copyleft movements like the Free  Software Foundation and Creative Commons have been around for years.  These movements are redefining a more flexible spectrum of licenses for  both developers and end-users to tag their works. Because the new  licenses can be recognized by either humans or machines, it\u2019s becoming  easier to re-share those works in new online ecosystems. The Spirit of the Web, a Social Brain Sharism is the Spirit of the Age of Web 2.0. It has the consistency of a  naturalized Epistemology and modernized Axiology, but also promises the  power of a new Internet philosophy. Sharism will transform the world  into an emergent Social Brain: a networked hybrid of people and  software. We are Networked Neurons connected by the synapses of Social  Software. This is an evolutionary leap, a small step for us and a giant one for  human society. With new \u201chairy\u201d emergent technologies sprouting all  around us, we can generate higher connectivities and increase the  throughput of our social links. The more open and strongly connected we  social neurons are, the better the sharing environment will be for all  people. The more collective our intelligence, the wiser our actions will  be. People have always found better solutions through conversations. Now  we can put it all online. Sharism will be the politics of the next global superpower. It will not  be a country, but a new human network joined by Social Software. This  may remain a distant dream, and even a well-defined public sharing  policy might not be close at hand. But the ideas that I\u2019m discussing can  improve governments today. We can integrate our current and emerging  democratic systems with new folksonomies (based on the collaborative,  social indexing of information) to enable people to make queries, share  data and remix information for public use. The collective intelligence  of a vast and equitable sharing environment can be the gatekeeper of our  rights, and a government watchdog. In the future, policymaking can be  made more nuanced with the micro-involvement of the sharing community.  This \u201cEmergent Democracy\u201d is more real-time than periodical  parliamentary sessions. It will also increase the spectrum of our  choices, beyond the binary options of \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d referenda.  Representative democracy will become more timely and diligent, because  we will represent ourselves within the system. Sharism will result in better social justice. In a healthy sharing  environment, any evidence of injustice can get amplified to get the  public\u2019s attention. Anyone who has been abused can get real and instant  support from her peers and her peers\u2019 peers. Appeals to justice will  take the form of petitions through multiple, interconnected channels.  Using these tools, anyone can create a large social impact. With  multiple devices and many social applications, each of us can become  more sociable, and society more individual. We no longer have to act  alone. Emergent democracy will only happen when Sharism becomes the literacy of  the majority. Since Sharism can improve communication, collaboration and  mutual understanding, I believe it has a place within the educational  system. Sharism can be applied to any cultural discourse, CoP (Community  of Practice) or problem-solving context. It is also an antidote to  social depression, since sharelessness is just dragging our society  down. In present or formerly totalitarian countries, this downward cycle  is even more apparent. The future world will be a hybrid of human and  machine that will generate better and faster decisions anytime,  anywhere. The flow of information between minds will become more  flexible and more productive. These vast networks of sharing will create  a new social order\u2212A Mind Revolution! \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow is Sharism justified?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"sharing is embedded within human deoxyribonucleic acid and a hardwired feature of the brain\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"sharing is the only way to eliminate economic and social disparities among neighboring countries\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"sharing is the only way to eliminate economic and social disparities among neighboring countries\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"sharing is the only way to eliminate economic and social disparities among neighboring countries\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

What  motivates those who join this movement and what future will they create?  A key fact is that a superabundance of community respect and social  capital are being accumulated by those who share. The key motivator of  Social Media and the core spirit of Web 2.0 is a mind switch called  Sharism. Sharism suggests a re-orientation of personal values. We see it  in User Generated Content. It is the pledge of Creative Commons. It is  in the plans of future-oriented cultural initiatives. Sharism is also a  mental practice that anyone can try, a social-psychological attitude to  transform a wide and isolated world into a super-smart Social Brain. The Neuron Doctrine Sharism is encoded in the Human Genome. Although eclipsed by the many  pragmatisms of daily life, the theory of Sharism finds basis in  neuroscience and its study of the working model of the human brain.  Although we can\u2019t entirely say how the brain works as a whole, we do  have a model of the functional mechanism of the nervous system and its  neurons. A neuron is not a simple organic cell, but a very powerful,  electrically excitable biological processor. Groups of neurons form  vastly interconnected networks, which, by changing the strength of the  synapses between cells, can process information, and learn. A neuron, by  sharing chemical signals with its neighbors, can be integrated into more  meaningful patterns that keep the neuron active and alive. Moreover,  such a simple logic can be iterated and amplified, since all neurons  work on a similar principle of connecting and sharing. Originally, the  brain is quite open. A neural network exists to share activity and  information, and I believe this model of the brain should inspire ideas  and decisions about human networks. Thus, our brain supports sharing in its very system-nature. This has  profound implications for the creative process. Whenever you have an  intention to create, you will find it easier to generate more creative  ideas if you keep the sharing process firmly in mind. The  idea-forming-process is not linear, but more like an avalanche of  amplifications along the thinking path. It moves with the momentum of a  creative snowball. If your internal cognitive system encourages sharing,  you can engineer a feedback loop of happiness, which will help you  generate even more ideas in return. It\u2019s a kind of butterfly- effect, as  the small creative energy you spend will eventually return to make you,  and the world, more creative. However, daily decisions for most adults are quite low in creative  productivity, if only because they\u2019ve switched off their sharing paths.  People generally like to share what they create, but in a culture that  tells them to be protective of their ideas, people start to believe in  the danger of sharing. Then Sharism will be degraded in their mind and  not encouraged in their society. But if we can encourage someone to  share, her sharing paths will stay open. Sharism will be kept in her  mind as a memory and an instinct. If in the future she faces a creative  choice, her choice will be, \u201cShare.\u201d These mind-switches are too subtle to be felt. But since the brain, and  society, is a connected system, the accumulation of these  micro-attitudes, from neuron to neuron and person to person, can result  in observable behavior. It is easy to tell if a person, a group, a  company, a nation is oriented toward Sharism or not. For those who are  not, what they defend as \u201ccultural goods\u201d and \u201cintellectual property\u201d  are just excuses for the status quo of keeping a community closed. Much  of their \u201cculture\u201d will be protected, but the net result is the direct  loss of many other precious ideas, and the subsequent loss of all the  potential gains of sharing. This lost knowledge is a black hole in our  life, which may start to swallow other values as well. Non-sharing culture misleads us with its absolute separation of Private  and Public space. It makes creative action a binary choice between  public and private, open and closed. This creates a gap in the spectrum  of knowledge. Although this gap has the potential to become a valuable  creative space, concerns about privacy make this gap hard to fill. We  shouldn\u2019t be surprised that, to be safe, most people keep their sharing  private and stay \u201cclosed.\u201d They may fear the Internet creates a  potential for abuse that they can\u2019t fight alone. However, the paradox  is: The less you share, the less power you have. New Technologies and the Rise of Sharism Let\u2019s track back to 1999, when there were only a few hundred pioneer  bloggers around the world, and no more than ten times that many readers  following each blog. Human history is always so: something important was  happening, but the rest of the world hadn\u2019t yet realized it. The shift  toward easy-to-use online publishing triggered a soft revolution in just  five years. People made a quick and easy transition from reading blogs,  to leaving comments and taking part in online conversations, and then to  the sudden realization that they should become bloggers themselves. More  bloggers created more readers, and more readers made more blogs. The  revolution was viral. Bloggers generate lively and timely information on the Internet, and  connect to each other with RSS, hyperlinks, comments, trackbacks and  quotes. The small-scale granularity of the content can fill discrete  gaps in experience and thus record a new human history. Once you become  a blogger, once you have accumulated so much social capital in such a  small site, it\u2019s hard to stop. We can\u2019t explain this fact with a theory  of addiction. It\u2019s an impulse to share. It\u2019s the energy of the memes  that want to be passed from mouth to mouth and mind to mind. It\u2019s more  than just E-mail. It\u2019s Sharism. Bloggers are always keen to keep the social context of their posts in  mind, by asking themselves, \u201cWho is going to see this?\u201d Bloggers are  agile in adjusting their tone\u2212and privacy settings\u2212to advance ideas and  stay out of trouble. It\u2019s not self-censorship, but a sense of smart  expression. But once blogs reached the tipping point, they expanded into  the blogosphere. This required a more delicate social networking system  and content- sharing architecture. But people now understand that they  can have better control over a wide spectrum of relationships. Like how  Flickr allows people to share their photos widely, but safely. The  checkbox-based privacy of Flickr may seem unfamiliar to a new user, but  you can use it to toy with the mind-switches of Sharism. By checking a  box we can choose to share or not to share. From my observations, I have  seen photographers on Flickr become more open to sharing, while  retaining flexible choices. The rapid emergence of Social Applications that can communicate and  cooperate, by allowing people to output content from one service to  another, is letting users pump their memes into a pipeline-like  ecosystem. This interconnectedness allows memes to travel along multiple  online social networks, and potentially reach a huge audience. As a  result, such a Micro-pipeline system is making Social Media a true  alternative to broadcast media. These new technologies are reviving  Sharism in our closed culture. Local Practice, Global Gain If you happened to lose your Sharism in a bad educational or cultural  setting, it\u2019s hard to get it back. But it\u2019s not impossible. A  persistence of practice can lead to a full recovery. You can think of  Sharism as a spiritual practice. But you must practice everyday.  Otherwise, you might lose the power of sharing. Permanently. You might need something to spur you on, to keep you from quitting and  returning to a closed mindset. Here\u2019s an idea: put a sticky note on your  desk that says, \u201cWhat do you want to share today?\u201d I\u2019m not kidding.  Then, if anything interesting comes your way: Share It! The easiest way  to both start and keep sharing is by using different kinds of social  software applications. Your first meme you want to share may be small,  but you can amplify it with new technologies. Enlist some people from  your network and invite them into a new social application. At first it  might be hard to feel the gains of Sharism. The true test then is to see  if you can keep track of the feedback that you get from sharing. You  will realize that almost all sharing activities will generate positive  results. The happiness that this will obtain is only the most immediate  reward. But there are others. The first type of reward that you will get comes in the form of  comments. Then you know you\u2019ve provoked interest, appreciation,  excitement. The second reward is access to all the other stuff being  shared by friends in your network. Since you know and trust them, you  will be that much more interested in what they have to share. Already,  the return is a multiple of the small meme you first shared. But the  third type of return is more dramatic still.

Improvements in social software are making the speed of dissemination as  fast as a mouse-click. You should get to know the Sharism-You. You\u2019re  about to become popular, and fast This brings us to the fourth and final type of return. It has a meaning  not only for you, but for the whole of society.
