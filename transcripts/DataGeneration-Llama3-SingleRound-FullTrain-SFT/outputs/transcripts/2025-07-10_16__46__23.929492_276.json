      "background_text": "UNBORN\n\n TOMORROW BY MACK REYNOLDS Unfortunately , there was only  one thing he could bring back  from the wonderful future ...  and though he didn't want to  ... nevertheless he did.... Illustrated by Freas\n\n\n Betty  looked up from  her magazine. She said  mildly, \"You're late.\"\n\n\n \"Don't yell at me, I  feel awful,\" Simon told  her. He sat down at his desk, passed  his tongue over his teeth in distaste,  groaned, fumbled in a drawer for the  aspirin bottle.\n\n\n He looked over at Betty and said,  almost as though reciting, \"What I  need is a vacation.\"\n\n\n \"What,\" Betty said, \"are you going  to use for money?\"\n\n\n \"Providence,\" Simon told her  whilst fiddling with the aspirin bottle,  \"will provide.\"\n\n\n \"Hm-m-m. But before providing  vacations it'd be nice if Providence  turned up a missing jewel deal, say.  Something where you could deduce  that actually the ruby ring had gone  down the drain and was caught in the  elbow. Something that would net  about fifty dollars.\"\n\n\n Simon said, mournful of tone,  \"Fifty dollars? Why not make it five  hundred?\"\n\n\n \"I'm not selfish,\" Betty said. \"All  I want is enough to pay me this  week's salary.\"\n\n\n \"Money,\" Simon said. \"When you  took this job you said it was the romance  that appealed to you.\"\n\n\n \"Hm-m-m. I didn't know most  sleuthing amounted to snooping  around department stores to check on  the clerks knocking down.\"\n\n\n Simon said, enigmatically, \"Now  it comes.\" There was a knock.\n\n\n Betty bounced up with Olympic  agility and had the door swinging  wide before the knocking was quite  completed.\n\n\n He was old, little and had bug  eyes behind pince-nez glasses. His  suit was cut in the style of yesteryear  but when a suit costs two or  three hundred dollars you still retain  caste whatever the styling.\n\n\n Simon said unenthusiastically,  \"Good morning, Mr. Oyster.\" He indicated  the client's chair. \"Sit down,  sir.\"\n\n\n The client fussed himself with  Betty's assistance into the seat, bug-eyed  Simon, said finally, \"You know  my name, that's pretty good. Never  saw you before in my life. Stop fussing  with me, young lady. Your ad  in the phone book says you'll investigate  anything.\"\n\n\n \"Anything,\" Simon said. \"Only  one exception.\"\n\n\n \"Excellent. Do you believe in time  travel?\"\n\n\n Simon said nothing. Across the  room, where she had resumed her  seat, Betty cleared her throat. When  Simon continued to say nothing she  ventured, \"Time travel is impossible.\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, why?\"\n\n\n Betty looked to her boss for assistance.  None was forthcoming. There  ought to be some very quick, positive,  definite answer. She said, \"Well,  for one thing, paradox. Suppose you  had a time machine and traveled back  a hundred years or so and killed your  own great-grandfather. Then how  could you ever be born?\"\n\n\n \"Confound it if I know,\" the little  fellow growled. \"How?\"\n\n\n Simon said, \"Let's get to the point,  what you wanted to see me about.\"\n\n\n \"I want to hire you to hunt me up  some time travelers,\" the old boy  said.\n\n\n Betty was too far in now to maintain  her proper role of silent secretary.  \"Time travelers,\" she said, not  very intelligently.\n\n\n The potential client sat more erect,  obviously with intent to hold the  floor for a time. He removed the  pince-nez glasses and pointed them  at Betty. He said, \"Have you read  much science fiction, Miss?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Betty admitted.\n\n\n \"Then you'll realize that there are  a dozen explanations of the paradoxes  of time travel. Every writer in  the field worth his salt has explained  them away. But to get on. It's my  contention that within a century or  so man will have solved the problems  of immortality and eternal youth, and  it's also my suspicion that he will  eventually be able to travel in time.  So convinced am I of these possibilities  that I am willing to gamble a  portion of my fortune to investigate  the presence in our era of such time  travelers.\"\n\n\n Simon seemed incapable of carrying  the ball this morning, so Betty  said, \"But ... Mr. Oyster, if the  future has developed time travel why  don't we ever meet such travelers?\"\n\n\n Simon put in a word. \"The usual  explanation, Betty, is that they can't  afford to allow the space-time continuum  track to be altered. If, say, a  time traveler returned to a period of  twenty-five years ago and shot Hitler,  then all subsequent history would be  changed. In that case, the time traveler  himself might never be born. They  have to tread mighty carefully.\"\n\n\n Mr. Oyster was pleased. \"I didn't  expect you to be so well informed  on the subject, young man.\"\n\n\n Simon shrugged and fumbled  again with the aspirin bottle. Mr. Oyster went on. \"I've been  considering the matter for some time  and\u2014\"\n\n\n Simon held up a hand. \"There's  no use prolonging this. As I understand  it, you're an elderly gentleman  with a considerable fortune and you  realize that thus far nobody has succeeded  in taking it with him.\"\n\n\n Mr. Oyster returned his glasses to  their perch, bug-eyed Simon, but then  nodded.\n\n\n Simon said, \"You want to hire me  to find a time traveler and in some  manner or other\u2014any manner will  do\u2014exhort from him the secret of  eternal life and youth, which you figure  the future will have discovered.  You're willing to pony up a part of  this fortune of yours, if I can deliver  a bona fide time traveler.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\"\n\n\n Betty had been looking from one  to the other. Now she said, plaintively,  \"But where are you going to find  one of these characters\u2014especially if  they're interested in keeping hid?\"\n\n\n The old boy was the center again.  \"I told you I'd been considering it  for some time. The Oktoberfest ,  that's where they'd be!\" He seemed  elated.\n\n\n Betty and Simon waited.\n\n\n \"The Oktoberfest ,\" he repeated.  \"The greatest festival the world has  ever seen, the carnival, feria , fiesta to beat them all. Every year it's held  in Munich. Makes the New Orleans  Mardi gras look like a quilting  party.\" He began to swing into the  spirit of his description. \"It originally  started in celebration of the wedding  of some local prince a century  and a half ago and the Bavarians had  such a bang-up time they've been  holding it every year since. The  Munich breweries do up a special  beer, Marzenbr\u00e4u they call it, and  each brewery opens a tremendous tent  on the fair grounds which will hold  five thousand customers apiece. Millions  of liters of beer are put away,  hundreds of thousands of barbecued  chickens, a small herd of oxen are  roasted whole over spits, millions of  pair of weisswurst , a very special  sausage, millions upon millions of  pretzels\u2014\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Simon said. \"We'll accept  it. The Oktoberfest is one whale  of a wingding.\" \"Well,\" the old boy pursued, into  his subject now, \"that's where they'd  be, places like the Oktoberfest . For  one thing, a time traveler wouldn't  be conspicuous. At a festival like this  somebody with a strange accent, or  who didn't know exactly how to wear  his clothes correctly, or was off the  ordinary in any of a dozen other  ways, wouldn't be noticed. You could  be a four-armed space traveler from  Mars, and you still wouldn't be conspicuous  at the Oktoberfest . People  would figure they had D.T.'s.\"\n\n\n \"But why would a time traveler  want to go to a\u2014\" Betty began.\n\n\n \"Why not! What better opportunity  to study a people than when they  are in their cups? If you could go  back a few thousand years, the things  you would wish to see would be a  Roman Triumph, perhaps the Rites  of Dionysus, or one of Alexander's  orgies. You wouldn't want to wander  up and down the streets of, say,  Athens while nothing was going on,  particularly when you might be revealed  as a suspicious character not  being able to speak the language, not  knowing how to wear the clothes and  not familiar with the city's layout.\"  He took a deep breath. \"No ma'am,  you'd have to stick to some great  event, both for the sake of actual  interest and for protection against being  unmasked.\"\n\n\n The old boy wound it up. \"Well,  that's the story. What are your rates?  The Oktoberfest starts on Friday and  continues for sixteen days. You can  take the plane to Munich, spend a  week there and\u2014\"\n\n\n Simon was shaking his head. \"Not  interested.\"\n\n\n As soon as Betty had got her jaw  back into place, she glared unbelievingly  at him.\n\n\n Mr. Oyster was taken aback himself.  \"See here, young man, I realize  this isn't an ordinary assignment,  however, as I said, I am willing to  risk a considerable portion of my  fortune\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sorry,\" Simon said. \"Can't be  done.\"\n\n\n \"A hundred dollars a day plus expenses,\"  Mr. Oyster said quietly. \"I  like the fact that you already seem  to have some interest and knowledge  of the matter. I liked the way you  knew my name when I walked in the  door; my picture doesn't appear often  in the papers.\"\n\n\n \"No go,\" Simon said, a sad quality  in his voice.\n\n\n \"A fifty thousand dollar bonus if  you bring me a time traveler.\"\n\n\n \"Out of the question,\" Simon  said.\n\n\n \"But why ?\" Betty wailed.\n\n\n \"Just for laughs,\" Simon told the  two of them sourly, \"suppose I tell  you a funny story. It goes like  this:\" I got a thousand dollars from Mr.  Oyster (Simon began) in the way  of an advance, and leaving him with  Betty who was making out a receipt,  I hustled back to the apartment and  packed a bag. Hell, I'd wanted a vacation  anyway, this was a natural. On  the way to Idlewild I stopped off at  the Germany Information Offices for  some tourist literature.\n\n\n It takes roughly three and a half  hours to get to Gander from Idlewild.  I spent the time planning the  fun I was going to have.\n\n\n It takes roughly seven and a half  hours from Gander to Shannon and  I spent that time dreaming up material  I could put into my reports to  Mr. Oyster. I was going to have to  give him some kind of report for his  money. Time travel yet! What a  laugh!\n\n\n Between Shannon and Munich a  faint suspicion began to simmer in  my mind. These statistics I read on  the Oktoberfest in the Munich tourist  pamphlets. Five million people  attended annually.\n\n\n Where did five million people  come from to attend an overgrown  festival in comparatively remote  Southern Germany? The tourist season  is over before September 21st,  first day of the gigantic beer bust.  Nor could the Germans account for  any such number. Munich itself has  a population of less than a million,  counting children.\n\n\n And those millions of gallons of  beer, the hundreds of thousands of  chickens, the herds of oxen. Who  ponied up all the money for such expenditures?  How could the average  German, with his twenty-five dollars  a week salary?\n\n\n In Munich there was no hotel  space available. I went to the Bahnhof  where they have a hotel service  and applied. They put my name  down, pocketed the husky bribe,  showed me where I could check my  bag, told me they'd do what they  could, and to report back in a few  hours.\n\n\n I had another suspicious twinge.  If five million people attended this  beer bout, how were they accommodated?\n\n\n The Theresienwiese , the fair  ground, was only a few blocks  away. I was stiff from the plane ride  so I walked. There are seven major brewers in  the Munich area, each of them represented  by one of the circuslike tents  that Mr. Oyster mentioned. Each tent  contained benches and tables for  about five thousand persons and from  six to ten thousands pack themselves  in, competing for room. In the center  is a tremendous bandstand, the  musicians all lederhosen clad, the  music as Bavarian as any to be found  in a Bavarian beer hall. Hundreds of  peasant garbed fr\u00e4uleins darted about  the tables with quart sized earthenware  mugs, platters of chicken, sausage,  kraut and pretzels.\n\n\n I found a place finally at a table  which had space for twenty-odd beer  bibbers. Odd is right. As weird an  assortment of Germans and foreign  tourists as could have been dreamed  up, ranging from a seventy- or  eighty-year-old couple in Bavarian  costume, to the bald-headed drunk  across the table from me.\n\n\n A desperate waitress bearing six  mugs of beer in each hand scurried  past. They call them masses , by the  way, not mugs. The bald-headed  character and I both held up a finger  and she slid two of the masses over  to us and then hustled on.\n\n\n \"Down the hatch,\" the other said,  holding up his mass in toast.\n\n\n \"To the ladies,\" I told him. Before  sipping, I said, \"You know, the  tourist pamphlets say this stuff is  eighteen per cent. That's nonsense.  No beer is that strong.\" I took a long  pull.\n\n\n He looked at me, waiting.\n\n\n I came up. \"Mistaken,\" I admitted.\n\n\n A mass or two apiece later he looked  carefully at the name engraved on  his earthenware mug. \"L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u,\"  he said. He took a small notebook  from his pocket and a pencil, noted  down the word and returned the  things.\n\n\n \"That's a queer looking pencil you  have there,\" I told him. \"German?\"\n\n\n \"Venusian,\" he said. \"Oops, sorry.  Shouldn't have said that.\"\n\n\n I had never heard of the brand so  I skipped it.\n\n\n \"Next is the Hofbr\u00e4u,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Next what?\" Baldy's conversation  didn't seem to hang together very  well.\n\n\n \"My pilgrimage,\" he told me. \"All  my life I've been wanting to go back  to an Oktoberfest and sample every  one of the seven brands of the best  beer the world has ever known. I'm  only as far as L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u. I'm afraid  I'll never make it.\"\n\n\n I finished my mass . \"I'll help  you,\" I told him. \"Very noble endeavor.  Name is Simon.\"\n\n\n \"Arth,\" he said. \"How could you  help?\"\n\n\n \"I'm still fresh\u2014comparatively.  I'll navigate you around. There are  seven beer tents. How many have you  got through, so far?\"\n\n\n \"Two, counting this one,\" Arth  said.\n\n\n I looked at him. \"It's going to be  a chore,\" I said. \"You've already got  a nice edge on.\"\n\n\n Outside, as we made our way to  the next tent, the fair looked like  every big State-Fair ever seen, except  it was bigger. Games, souvenir  stands, sausage stands, rides, side  shows, and people, people, people.\n\n\n The Hofbr\u00e4u tent was as overflowing  as the last but we managed to  find two seats.\n\n\n The band was blaring, and five  thousand half-swacked voices were  roaring accompaniment. In Muenchen steht ein Hofbr\u00e4uhaus! Eins, Zwei, G'sufa! At the G'sufa everybody upped  with the mugs and drank each other's  health.\n\n\n \"This is what I call a real beer  bust,\" I said approvingly.\n\n\n Arth was waving to a waitress. As  in the L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u tent, a full quart  was the smallest amount obtainable.\n\n\n A beer later I said, \"I don't know  if you'll make it or not, Arth.\"\n\n\n \"Make what?\"\n\n\n \"All seven tents.\"\n\n\n \"Oh.\"\n\n\n A waitress was on her way by,  mugs foaming over their rims. I gestured  to her for refills.\n\n\n \"Where are you from, Arth?\" I  asked him, in the way of making  conversation.\n\n\n \"2183.\"\n\n\n \"2183 where?\"\n\n\n He looked at me, closing one eye  to focus better. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Well,  2183 South Street, ah, New Albuquerque.\"\n\n\n \"New Albuquerque? Where's  that?\"\n\n\n Arth thought about it. Took another  long pull at the beer. \"Right  across the way from old Albuquerque,\"  he said finally. \"Maybe we  ought to be getting on to the  Pschorrbr\u00e4u tent.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe we ought to eat something  first,\" I said. \"I'm beginning to feel  this. We could get some of that barbecued  ox.\"\n\n\n Arth closed his eyes in pain.  \"Vegetarian,\" he said. \"Couldn't possibly  eat meat. Barbarous. Ugh.\"\n\n\n \"Well, we need some nourishment,\"  I said.\n\n\n \"There's supposed to be considerable  nourishment in beer.\"\n\n\n That made sense. I yelled, \" Fr\u00e4ulein!  Zwei neu bier! \" Somewhere along in here the fog  rolled in. When it rolled out again,  I found myself closing one eye the  better to read the lettering on my  earthenware mug. It read Augustinerbr\u00e4u.  Somehow we'd evidently  navigated from one tent to another.\n\n\n Arth was saying, \"Where's your  hotel?\"\n\n\n That seemed like a good question.  I thought about it for a while. Finally  I said, \"Haven't got one. Town's  jam packed. Left my bag at the Bahnhof.  I don't think we'll ever make  it, Arth. How many we got to  go?\"\n\n\n \"Lost track,\" Arth said. \"You can  come home with me.\"\n\n\n We drank to that and the fog rolled  in again.\n\n\n When the fog rolled out, it was  daylight. Bright, glaring, awful daylight.  I was sprawled, complete with  clothes, on one of twin beds. On the  other bed, also completely clothed,  was Arth.\n\n\n That sun was too much. I stumbled  up from the bed, staggered to  the window and fumbled around for  a blind or curtain. There was none.\n\n\n Behind me a voice said in horror,  \"Who ... how ... oh, Wodo ,  where'd you come from?\"\n\n\n I got a quick impression, looking  out the window, that the Germans  were certainly the most modern, futuristic  people in the world. But I  couldn't stand the light. \"Where's  the shade,\" I moaned.\n\n\n Arth did something and the window  went opaque.\n\n\n \"That's quite a gadget,\" I groaned.  \"If I didn't feel so lousy, I'd  appreciate it.\"\n\n\n Arth was sitting on the edge of  the bed holding his bald head in his  hands. \"I remember now,\" he sorrowed.  \"You didn't have a hotel.  What a stupidity. I'll be phased.  Phased all the way down.\"\n\n\n \"You haven't got a handful of  aspirin, have you?\" I asked him.\n\n\n \"Just a minute,\" Arth said, staggering  erect and heading for what  undoubtedly was a bathroom. \"Stay  where you are. Don't move. Don't  touch anything.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" I told him plaintively.  \"I'm clean. I won't mess up the  place. All I've got is a hangover, not  lice.\"\n\n\n Arth was gone. He came back in  two or three minutes, box of pills in  hand. \"Here, take one of these.\"\n\n\n I took the pill, followed it with a  glass of water. And went out like a light.\n\n\n Arth was shaking my arm. \"Want  another mass ?\"\n\n\n The band was blaring, and five  thousand half-swacked voices were  roaring accompaniment. In Muenchen steht ein Hofbr\u00e4uhaus! Eins, Zwei, G'sufa! At the G'sufa everybody upped  with their king-size mugs and drank  each other's health.\n\n\n My head was killing me. \"This is  where I came in, or something,\" I  groaned.\n\n\n Arth said, \"That was last night.\"  He looked at me over the rim of his  beer mug.\n\n\n Something, somewhere, was  wrong. But I didn't care. I finished  my mass and then remembered. \"I've  got to get my bag. Oh, my head.  Where did we spend last night?\"\n\n\n Arth said, and his voice sounded  cautious, \"At my hotel, don't you remember?\"\n\n\n \"Not very well,\" I admitted. \"I  feel lousy. I must have dimmed out.  I've got to go to the Bahnhof and  get my luggage.\"\n\n\n Arth didn't put up an argument  on that. We said good-by and I could  feel him watching after me as I pushed  through the tables on the way  out.\n\n\n At the Bahnhof they could do me  no good. There were no hotel rooms  available in Munich. The head was  getting worse by the minute. The  fact that they'd somehow managed  to lose my bag didn't help. I worked  on that project for at least a couple  of hours. Not only wasn't the bag  at the luggage checking station, but  the attendant there evidently couldn't  make heads nor tails of the check  receipt. He didn't speak English and  my high school German was inadequate,  especially accompanied by a  blockbusting hangover.\n\n\n I didn't get anywhere tearing my  hair and complaining from one end  of the Bahnhof to the other. I drew  a blank on the bag.\n\n\n And the head was getting worse  by the minute. I was bleeding to  death through the eyes and instead  of butterflies I had bats in my stomach.  Believe me, nobody should drink  a gallon or more of Marzenbr\u00e4u. I decided the hell with it. I took  a cab to the airport, presented my return  ticket, told them I wanted to  leave on the first obtainable plane to  New York. I'd spent two days at the Oktoberfest , and I'd had it.\n\n\n I got more guff there. Something  was wrong with the ticket, wrong  date or some such. But they fixed  that up. I never was clear on what  was fouled up, some clerk's error,  evidently.\n\n\n The trip back was as uninteresting  as the one over. As the hangover began  to wear off\u2014a little\u2014I was almost  sorry I hadn't been able to stay.  If I'd only been able to get a room I would have stayed, I told myself.\n\n\n From Idlewild, I came directly to  the office rather than going to my  apartment. I figured I might as well  check in with Betty.\n\n\n I opened the door and there I  found Mr. Oyster sitting in the chair  he had been occupying four\u2014or was  it five\u2014days before when I'd left.  I'd lost track of the time.\n\n\n I said to him, \"Glad you're here,  sir. I can report. Ah, what was it  you came for? Impatient to hear if  I'd had any results?\" My mind was  spinning like a whirling dervish in  a revolving door. I'd spent a wad of  his money and had nothing I could  think of to show for it; nothing but  the last stages of a grand-daddy  hangover.\n\n\n \"Came for?\" Mr. Oyster snorted.  \"I'm merely waiting for your girl to  make out my receipt. I thought you  had already left.\"\n\n\n \"You'll miss your plane,\" Betty  said.\n\n\n There was suddenly a double dip  of ice cream in my stomach. I walked  over to my desk and looked down at  the calendar.\n\n\n Mr. Oyster was saying something  to the effect that if I didn't leave today,  it would have to be tomorrow,  that he hadn't ponied up that thousand  dollars advance for anything  less than immediate service. Stuffing  his receipt in his wallet, he fussed  his way out the door.\n\n\n I said to Betty hopefully, \"I suppose  you haven't changed this calendar  since I left.\"\n\n\n Betty said, \"What's the matter  with you? You look funny. How did  your clothes get so mussed? You tore  the top sheet off that calendar yourself,  not half an hour ago, just before  this marble-missing client came  in.\" She added, irrelevantly, \"Time  travelers yet.\"\n\n\n I tried just once more. \"Uh, when  did you first see this Mr. Oyster?\"\n\n\n \"Never saw him before in my  life,\" she said. \"Not until he came  in this morning.\"\n\n\n \"This morning,\" I said weakly.\n\n\n While Betty stared at me as though  it was me that needed candling by a  head shrinker preparatory to being  sent off to a pressure cooker, I fished  in my pocket for my wallet, counted  the contents and winced at the  pathetic remains of the thousand.  I said pleadingly, \"Betty, listen,  how long ago did I go out that door\u2014on  the way to the airport?\"\n\n\n \"You've been acting sick all morning.  You went out that door about  ten minutes ago, were gone about  three minutes, and then came back.\" \"See here,\" Mr. Oyster said (interrupting  Simon's story), \"did you  say this was supposed to be amusing,  young man? I don't find it so. In  fact, I believe I am being ridiculed.\"\n\n\n Simon shrugged, put one hand to  his forehead and said, \"That's only  the first chapter. There are two  more.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not interested in more,\" Mr.  Oyster said. \"I suppose your point  was to show me how ridiculous the  whole idea actually is. Very well,  you've done it. Confound it. However,  I suppose your time, even when  spent in this manner, has some value.  Here is fifty dollars. And good day,  sir!\"\n\n\n He slammed the door after him  as he left.\n\n\n Simon winced at the noise, took  the aspirin bottle from its drawer,  took two, washed them down with  water from the desk carafe.\n\n\n Betty looked at him admiringly.  Came to her feet, crossed over and  took up the fifty dollars. \"Week's  wages,\" she said. \"I suppose that's  one way of taking care of a crackpot.  But I'm surprised you didn't  take his money and enjoy that vacation  you've been yearning about.\"\n\n\n \"I did,\" Simon groaned. \"Three  times.\"\n\n\n Betty stared at him. \"You mean\u2014\"\n\n\n Simon nodded, miserably.\n\n\n She said, \"But Simon . Fifty thousand  dollars bonus. If that story was  true, you should have gone back  again to Munich. If there was one  time traveler, there might have  been\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I keep telling you,\" Simon said  bitterly, \"I went back there three  times. There were hundreds of them.  Probably thousands.\" He took a deep  breath. \"Listen, we're just going to  have to forget about it. They're not  going to stand for the space-time  continuum track being altered. If  something comes up that looks like  it might result in the track being  changed, they set you right back at  the beginning and let things start\u2014for  you\u2014all over again. They just  can't allow anything to come back  from the future and change the  past.\"\n\n\n \"You mean,\" Betty was suddenly  furious at him, \"you've given up!  Why this is the biggest thing\u2014 Why  the fifty thousand dollars is nothing.  The future! Just think!\"\n\n\n Simon said wearily, \"There's just  one thing you can bring back with  you from the future, a hangover compounded  of a gallon or so of Marzenbr\u00e4u.  What's more you can pile  one on top of the other, and another  on top of that!\"\n\n\n He shuddered. \"If you think I'm  going to take another crack at this  merry-go-round and pile a fourth  hangover on the three I'm already  nursing, all at once, you can think  again.\" THE END Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Astounding Science Fiction June  1959.

      "content": "He knows he will not be allowed to do something that might impact the past. Simon, the protagonist, has a friend who tells him about the Oktoberfest, where he sees people from the future. He brings Simon to the Oktoberfest to get him to get him to investigate the time travelers, but Simon rejects the offer.

Illustrated by Freas\n\n\n Betty  looked up from  her magazine. She said  mildly, \"You're late.\"\n\n\n \"Don't yell at me, I  feel awful,\" Simon told  her. He sat down at his desk, passed  his tongue over his teeth in distaste,  groaned, fumbled in a drawer for the  aspirin bottle.\n\n\n He looked over at Betty and said,  almost as though reciting, \"What I  need is a vacation.\"\n\n\n \"What,\" Betty said, \"are you going  to use for money?\"\n\n\n \"Providence,\" Simon told her  whilst fiddling with the aspirin bottle,  \"will provide.\"\n\n\n \"Hm-m-m. But before providing  vacations it'd be nice if Providence  turned up a missing jewel deal, say.  Something where you could deduce  that actually the ruby ring had gone  down the drain and was caught in the  elbow. Something that would net  about fifty dollars.\"\n\n\n Simon said, mournful of tone,  \"Fifty dollars? Why not make it five  hundred?\"\n\n\n \"I'm not selfish,\" Betty said. \"All  I want is enough to pay me this  week's salary.\"\n\n\n \"Money,\" Simon said. \"When you  took this job you said it was the romance  that appealed to you.\"\n\n\n \"Hm-m-m. I didn't know most  sleuthing amounted to snooping  around department stores to check on  the clerks knocking down.\"\n\n\n Simon said, enigmatically, \"Now  it comes.\" There was a knock.\n\n\n Betty bounced up with Olympic  agility and had the door swinging  wide before the knocking was quite  completed.\n\n\n He was old, little and had bug  eyes behind pince-nez glasses. His  suit was cut in the style of yesteryear  but when a suit costs two or  three hundred dollars you still retain  caste whatever the styling.\n\n\n Simon said unenthusiastically,  \"Good morning, Mr. Oyster.\" He indicated  the client's chair. \"Sit down,  sir.\"\n\n\n The client fussed himself with  Betty's assistance into the seat, bug-eyed  Simon, said finally, \"You know  my name, that's pretty good. Never  saw you before in my life. Stop fussing  with me, young lady. Your ad  in the phone book says you'll investigate  anything.\"\n\n\n \"Anything,\" Simon said. \"Only  one exception.\"\n\n\n \"Excellent. Do you believe in time  travel?\"\n\n\n Simon said nothing. Across the  room, where she had resumed her  seat, Betty cleared her throat. When  Simon continued to say nothing she  ventured, \"Time travel is impossible.\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, why?\"\n\n\n Betty looked to her boss for assistance.  None was forthcoming. There  ought to be some very quick, positive,  definite answer. She said, \"Well,  for one thing, paradox. Suppose you  had a time machine and traveled back  a hundred years or so and killed your  own great-grandfather. Then how  could you ever be born?\"\n\n\n \"Confound it if I know,\" the little  fellow growled. \"How?\"\n\n\n Simon said, \"Let's get to the point,  what you wanted to see me about.\"\n\n\n \"I want to hire you to hunt me up  some time travelers,\" the old boy  said.\n\n\n Betty was too far in now to maintain  her proper role of silent secretary.  \"Time travelers,\" she said, not  very intelligently.\n\n\n The potential client sat more erect,  obviously with intent to hold the  floor for a time. He removed the  pince-nez glasses and pointed them  at Betty. He said, \"Have you read  much science fiction, Miss?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Betty admitted.\n\n\n \"Then you'll realize that there are  a dozen explanations of the paradoxes  of time travel. Every writer in  the field worth his salt has explained  them away. But to get on. It's my  contention that within a century or  so man will have solved the problems  of immortality and eternal youth, and  it's also my suspicion that he will  eventually be able to travel in time.  So convinced am I of these possibilities  that I am willing to gamble a  portion of my fortune to investigate  the presence in our era of such time  travelers.\"\n\n\n Simon seemed incapable of carrying  the ball this morning, so Betty  said, \"But ... Mr. Oyster, if the  future has developed time travel why  don't we ever meet such travelers?\"\n\n\n Simon put in a word. \"The usual  explanation, Betty, is that they can't  afford to allow the space-time continuum  track to be altered. If, say, a  time traveler returned to a period of  twenty-five years ago and shot Hitler,  then all subsequent history would be  changed. In that case, the time traveler  himself might never be born. They  have to tread mighty carefully.\"\n\n\n Mr. Oyster was pleased. \"I didn't  expect you to be so well informed  on the subject, young man.\"\n\n\n Simon shrugged and fumbled  again with the aspirin bottle. Mr. Oyster went on. \"I've been  considering the matter for some time  and\u2014\"\n\n\n Simon held up a hand. \"There's  no use prolonging this. As I understand  it, you're an elderly gentleman  with a considerable fortune and you  realize that thus far nobody has succeeded  in taking it with him.\"\n\n\n Mr. Oyster returned his glasses to  their perch, bug-eyed Simon, but then  nodded.\n\n\n Simon said, \"You want to hire me  to find a time traveler and in some  manner or other\u2014any manner will  do\u2014exhort from him the secret of  eternal life and youth, which you figure  the future will have discovered.  You're willing to pony up a part of  this fortune of yours, if I can deliver  a bona fide time traveler.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\"\n\n\n Betty had been looking from one  to the other. Now she said, plaintively,  \"But where are you going to find  one of these characters\u2014especially if  they're interested in keeping hid?\"\n\n\n The old boy was the center again.  \"I told you I'd been considering it  for some time. The Oktoberfest ,  that's where they'd be!\" He seemed  elated.\n\n\n Betty and Simon waited.\n\n\n \"The Oktoberfest ,\" he repeated.  \"The greatest festival the world has  ever seen, the carnival, feria , fiesta to beat them all. Every year it's held  in Munich. Makes the New Orleans  Mardi gras look like a quilting  party.\" He began to swing into the  spirit of his description. \"It originally  started in celebration of the wedding  of some local prince a century  and a half ago and the Bavarians had  such a bang-up time they've been  holding it every year since. The  Munich breweries do up a special  beer, Marzenbr\u00e4u they call it, and  each brewery opens a tremendous tent  on the fair grounds which will hold  five thousand customers apiece. Millions  of liters of beer are put away,  hundreds of thousands of barbecued  chickens, a small herd of oxen are  roasted whole over spits, millions of  pair of weisswurst , a very special  sausage, millions upon millions of  pretzels\u2014\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Simon said. \"We'll accept  it. The Oktoberfest is one whale  of a wingding.\" \"Well,\" the old boy pursued, into  his subject now, \"that's where they'd  be, places like the Oktoberfest . For  one thing, a time traveler wouldn't  be conspicuous. At a festival like this  somebody with a strange accent, or  who didn't know exactly how to wear  his clothes correctly, or was off the  ordinary in any of a dozen other  ways, wouldn't be noticed. You could  be a four-armed space traveler from  Mars, and you still wouldn't be conspicuous  at the Oktoberfest . People  would figure they had D.T.'s.\"\n\n\n \"But why would a time traveler  want to go to a\u2014\" Betty began.\n\n\n \"Why not! What better opportunity  to study a people than when they  are in their cups? If you could go  back a few thousand years, the things  you would wish to see would be a  Roman Triumph, perhaps the Rites  of Dionysus, or one of Alexander's  orgies. You wouldn't want to wander  up and down the streets of, say,  Athens while nothing was going on,  particularly when you might be revealed  as a suspicious character not  being able to speak the language, not  knowing how to wear the clothes and  not familiar with the city's layout.\"  He took a deep breath. \"No ma'am,  you'd have to stick to some great  event, both for the sake of actual  interest and for protection against being  unmasked.\"\n\n\n The old boy wound it up. \"Well,  that's the story. What are your rates?  The Oktoberfest starts on Friday and  continues for sixteen days. You can  take the plane to Munich, spend a  week there and\u2014\"\n\n\n Simon was shaking his head. \"Not  interested.\"\n\n\n As soon as Betty had got her jaw  back into place, she glared unbelievingly  at him.\n\n\n Mr. Oyster was taken aback himself.  \"See here, young man, I realize  this isn't an ordinary assignment,  however, as I said, I am willing to  risk a considerable portion of my  fortune\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sorry,\" Simon said. \"Can't be  done.\"\n\n\n \"A hundred dollars a day plus expenses,\"  Mr. Oyster said quietly. \"I  like the fact that you already seem  to have some interest and knowledge  of the matter. I liked the way you  knew my name when I walked in the  door; my picture doesn't appear often  in the papers.\"\n\n\n \"No go,\" Simon said, a sad quality  in his voice.\n\n\n \"A fifty thousand dollar bonus if  you bring me a time traveler.\"\n\n\n \"Out of the question,\" Simon  said.\n\n\n \"But why ?\" Betty wailed.\n\n\n \"Just for laughs,\" Simon told the  two of them sourly, \"suppose I tell  you a funny story. It goes like  this:\" I got a thousand dollars from Mr.  Oyster (Simon began) in the way  of an advance, and leaving him with  Betty who was making out a receipt,  I hustled back to the apartment and  packed a bag. Hell, I'd wanted a vacation  anyway, this was a natural. On  the way to Idlewild I stopped off at  the Germany Information Offices for  some tourist literature.\n\n\n It takes roughly three and a half  hours to get to Gander from Idlewild.  I spent the time planning the  fun I was going to have.\n\n\n It takes roughly seven and a half  hours from Gander to Shannon and  I spent that time dreaming up material  I could put into my reports to  Mr. Oyster. I was going to have to  give him some kind of report for his  money. Time travel yet! What a  laugh!\n\n\n Between Shannon and Munich a  faint suspicion began to simmer in  my mind. These statistics I read on  the Oktoberfest in the Munich tourist  pamphlets. Five million people  attended annually.\n\n\n Where did five million people  come from to attend an overgrown  festival in comparatively remote  Southern Germany? The tourist season  is over before September 21st,  first day of the gigantic beer bust.  Nor could the Germans account for  any such number. Munich itself has  a population of less than a million,  counting children.\n\n\n And those millions of gallons of  beer, the hundreds of thousands of  chickens, the herds of oxen. Who  ponied up all the money for such expenditures?  How could the average  German, with his twenty-five dollars  a week salary?\n\n\n In Munich there was no hotel  space available. I went to the Bahnhof  where they have a hotel service  and applied. They put my name  down, pocketed the husky bribe,  showed me where I could check my  bag, told me they'd do what they  could, and to report back in a few  hours.\n\n\n I had another suspicious twinge.  If five million people attended this  beer bout, how were they accommodated?\n\n\n The Theresienwiese , the fair  ground, was only a few blocks  away. I was stiff from the plane ride  so I walked. There are seven major brewers in  the Munich area, each of them represented  by one of the circuslike tents  that Mr. Oyster mentioned. Each tent  contained benches and tables for  about five thousand persons and from  six to ten thousands pack themselves  in, competing for room. In the center  is a tremendous bandstand, the  musicians all lederhosen clad, the  music as Bavarian as any to be found  in a Bavarian beer hall. Hundreds of  peasant garbed fr\u00e4uleins darted about  the tables with quart sized earthenware  mugs, platters of chicken, sausage,  kraut and pretzels.\n\n\n I found a place finally at a table  which had space for twenty-odd beer  bibbers. Odd is right. As weird an  assortment of Germans and foreign  tourists as could have been dreamed  up, ranging from a seventy- or  eighty-year-old couple in Bavarian  costume, to the bald-headed drunk  across the table from me.\n\n\n A desperate waitress bearing six  mugs of beer in each hand scurried  past. They call them masses , by the  way, not mugs. The bald-headed  character and I both held up a finger  and she slid two of the masses over  to us and then hustled on.\n\n\n \"Down the hatch,\" the other said,  holding up his mass in toast.\n\n\n \"To the ladies,\" I told him. Before  sipping, I said, \"You know, the  tourist pamphlets say this stuff is  eighteen per cent. That's nonsense.  No beer is that strong.\" I took a long  pull.\n\n\n He looked at me, waiting.\n\n\n I came up. \"Mistaken,\" I admitted.\n\n\n A mass or two apiece later he looked  carefully at the name engraved on  his earthenware mug. \"L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u,\"  he said. He took a small notebook  from his pocket and a pencil, noted  down the word and returned the  things.\n\n\n \"That's a queer looking pencil you  have there,\" I told him. \"German?\"\n\n\n \"Venusian,\" he said. \"Oops, sorry.  Shouldn't have said that.\"\n\n\n I had never heard of the brand so  I skipped it.\n\n\n \"Next is the Hofbr\u00e4u,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Next what?\" Baldy's conversation  didn't seem to hang together very  well.\n\n\n \"My pilgrimage,\" he told me. \"All  my life I've been wanting to go back  to an Oktoberfest and sample every  one of the seven brands of the best  beer the world has ever known. I'm  only as far as L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u. I'm afraid  I'll never make it.\"\n\n\n I finished my mass . \"I'll help  you,\" I told him. \"Very noble endeavor.  Name is Simon.\"\n\n\n \"Arth,\" he said. \"How could you  help?\"\n\n\n \"I'm still fresh\u2014comparatively.  I'll navigate you around. There are  seven beer tents. How many have you  got through, so far?\"\n\n\n \"Two, counting this one,\" Arth  said.\n\n\n I looked at him. \"It's going to be  a chore,\" I said. \"You've already got  a nice edge on.\"\n\n\n Outside, as we made our way to  the next tent, the fair looked like  every big State-Fair ever seen, except  it was bigger. Games, souvenir  stands, sausage stands, rides, side  shows, and people, people, people.\n\n\n The Hofbr\u00e4u tent was as overflowing  as the last but we managed to  find two seats.\n\n\n The band was blaring, and five  thousand half-swacked voices were  roaring accompaniment. In Muenchen steht ein Hofbr\u00e4uhaus! Eins, Zwei, G'sufa! At the G'sufa everybody upped  with the mugs and drank each other's  health.\n\n\n \"This is what I call a real beer  bust,\" I said approvingly.\n\n\n Arth was waving to a waitress. As  in the L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u tent, a full quart  was the smallest amount obtainable.\n\n\n A beer later I said, \"I don't know  if you'll make it or not, Arth.\"\n\n\n \"Make what?\"\n\n\n \"All seven tents.\"\n\n\n \"Oh.\"\n\n\n A waitress was on her way by,  mugs foaming over their rims. I gestured  to her for refills.\n\n\n \"Where are you from, Arth?\" I  asked him, in the way of making  conversation.\n\n\n \"2183.\"\n\n\n \"2183 where?\"\n\n\n He looked at me, closing one eye  to focus better. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Well,  2183 South Street, ah, New Albuquerque.\"\n\n\n \"New Albuquerque? Where's  that?\"\n\n\n Arth thought about it. Took another  long pull at the beer. \"Right  across the way from old Albuquerque,\"  he said finally. \"Maybe we  ought to be getting on to the  Pschorrbr\u00e4u tent.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe we ought to eat something  first,\" I said. \"I'm beginning to feel  this. We could get some of that barbecued  ox.\"\n\n\n Arth closed his eyes in pain.  \"Vegetarian,\" he said. \"Couldn't possibly  eat meat. Barbarous. Ugh.\"\n\n\n \"Well, we need some nourishment,\"  I said.\n\n\n \"There's supposed to be considerable  nourishment in beer.\"\n\n\n That made sense. I yelled, \" Fr\u00e4ulein!  Zwei neu bier! \" Somewhere along in here the fog  rolled in. When it rolled out again,  I found myself closing one eye the  better to read the lettering on my  earthenware mug. It read Augustinerbr\u00e4u.  Somehow we'd evidently  navigated from one tent to another.\n\n\n Arth was saying, \"Where's your  hotel?\"\n\n\n That seemed like a good question.  I thought about it for a while. Finally  I said, \"Haven't got one. Town's  jam packed. Left my bag at the Bahnhof.  I don't think we'll ever make  it, Arth. How many we got to  go?\"\n\n\n \"Lost track,\" Arth said. \"You can  come home with me.\"\n\n\n We drank to that and the fog rolled  in again.\n\n\n When the fog rolled out, it was  daylight. Bright, glaring, awful daylight.  I was sprawled, complete with  clothes, on one of twin beds. On the  other bed, also completely clothed,  was Arth.\n\n\n That sun was too much. I stumbled  up from the bed, staggered to  the window and fumbled around for  a blind or curtain. There was none.\n\n\n Behind me a voice said in horror,  \"Who ... how ... oh, Wodo ,  where'd you come from?\"\n\n\n I got a quick impression, looking  out the window, that the Germans  were certainly the most modern, futuristic  people in the world. But I  couldn't stand the light. \"Where's  the shade,\" I moaned.\n\n\n Arth did something and the window  went opaque.\n\n\n \"That's quite a gadget,\" I groaned.  \"If I didn't feel so lousy, I'd  appreciate it.\"\n\n\n Arth was sitting on the edge of  the bed holding his bald head in his  hands. \"I remember now,\" he sorrowed.  \"You didn't have a hotel.  What a stupidity. I'll be phased.  Phased all the way down.\"\n\n\n \"You haven't got a handful of  aspirin, have you?\" I asked him.\n\n\n \"Just a minute,\" Arth said, staggering  erect and heading for what  undoubtedly was a bathroom. \"Stay  where you are. Don't move. Don't  touch anything.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" I told him plaintively.  \"I'm clean. I won't mess up the  place. All I've got is a hangover, not  lice.\"\n\n\n Arth was gone. He came back in  two or three minutes, box of pills in  hand. \"Here, take one of these.\"\n\n\n I took the pill, followed it with a  glass of water. And went out like a light.\n\n\n Arth was shaking my arm. \"Want  another mass ?\"\n\n\n The band was blaring, and five  thousand half-swacked voices were  roaring accompaniment. In Muenchen steht ein Hofbr\u00e4uhaus! Eins, Zwei, G'sufa! At the G'sufa everybody upped  with their king-size mugs and drank  each other's health.\n\n\n My head was killing me. \"This is  where I came in, or something,\" I  groaned.\n\n\n Arth said, \"That was last night.\"  He looked at me over the rim of his  beer mug.\n\n\n Something, somewhere, was  wrong. But I didn't care. I finished  my mass and then remembered. \"I've  got to get my bag. Oh, my head.  Where did we spend last night?\"\n\n\n Arth said, and his voice sounded  cautious, \"At my hotel, don't you remember?\"\n\n\n \"Not very well,\" I admitted. \"I  feel lousy. I must have dimmed out.  I've got to go to the Bahnhof and  get my luggage.\"\n\n\n Arth didn't put up an argument  on that. We said good-by and I could  feel him watching after me as I pushed  through the tables on the way  out.\n\n\n At the Bahnhof they could do me  no good. There were no hotel rooms  available in Munich. The head was  getting worse by the minute. The  fact that they'd somehow managed  to lose my bag didn't help. I worked  on that project for at least a couple  of hours. Not only wasn't the bag  at the luggage checking station, but  the attendant there evidently couldn't  make heads nor tails of the check  receipt. He didn't speak English and  my high school German was inadequate,  especially accompanied by a  blockbusting hangover.\n\n\n I didn't get anywhere tearing my  hair and complaining from one end  of the Bahnhof to the other. I drew  a blank on the bag.\n\n\n And the head was getting worse  by the minute. I was bleeding to  death through the eyes and instead  of butterflies I had bats in my stomach.  Believe me, nobody should drink  a gallon or more of Marzenbr\u00e4u. I decided the hell with it. I took  a cab to the airport, presented my return  ticket, told them I wanted to  leave on the first obtainable plane to  New York. I'd spent two days at the Oktoberfest , and I'd had it.\n\n\n I got more guff there. Something  was wrong with the ticket, wrong  date or some such. But they fixed  that up. I never was clear on what  was fouled up, some clerk's error,  evidently.\n\n\n The trip back was as uninteresting  as the one over. As the hangover began  to wear off\u2014a little\u2014I was almost  sorry I hadn't been able to stay.  If I'd only been able to get a room I would have stayed, I told myself.\n\n\n From Idlewild, I came directly to  the office rather than going to my  apartment. I figured I might as well  check in with Betty.\n\n\n I opened the door and there I  found Mr. Oyster sitting in the chair  he had been occupying four\u2014or was  it five\u2014days before when I'd left.  I'd lost track of the time.\n\n\n I said to him, \"Glad you're here,  sir. I can report. Ah, what was it  you came for? Impatient to hear if  I'd had any results?\" My mind was  spinning like a whirling dervish in  a revolving door. I'd spent a wad of  his money and had nothing I could  think of to show for it; nothing but  the last stages of a grand-daddy  hangover.\n\n\n \"Came for?\" Mr. Oyster snorted.  \"I'm merely waiting for your girl to  make out my receipt. I thought you  had already left.\"\n\n\n \"You'll miss your plane,\" Betty  said.\n\n\n There was suddenly a double dip  of ice cream in my stomach. I walked  over to my desk and looked down at  the calendar.\n\n\n Mr. Oyster was saying something  to the effect that if I didn't leave today,  it would have to be tomorrow,  that he hadn't ponied up that thousand  dollars advance for anything  less than immediate service. Stuffing  his receipt in his wallet, he fussed  his way out the door.\n\n\n I said to Betty hopefully, \"I suppose  you haven't changed this calendar  since I left.\"\n\n\n Betty said, \"What's the matter  with you? You look funny. How did  your clothes get so mussed? You tore  the top sheet off that calendar yourself,  not half an hour ago, just before  this marble-missing client came  in.\" She added, irrelevantly, \"Time  travelers yet.\"\n\n\n I tried just once more. \"Uh, when  did you first see this Mr. Oyster?\"\n\n\n \"Never saw him before in my  life,\" she said. \"Not until he came  in this morning.\"\n\n\n \"This morning,\" I said weakly.\n\n\n While Betty stared at me as though  it was me that needed candling by a  head shrinker preparatory to being  sent off to a pressure cooker, I fished  in my pocket for my wallet, counted  the contents and winced at the  pathetic remains of the thousand.  I said pleadingly, \"Betty, listen,  how long ago did I go out that door\u2014on  the way to the airport?\"\n\n\n \"You've been acting sick all morning.  You went out that door about  ten minutes ago, were gone about  three minutes, and then came back.\" \"See here,\" Mr. Oyster said (interrupting  Simon's story), \"did you  say this was supposed to be amusing,  young man? I don't find it so. In  fact, I believe I am being ridiculed.\"\n\n\n Simon shrugged, put one hand to  his forehead and said, \"That's only  the first chapter. There are two  more.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not interested in more,\" Mr.  Oyster said. \"I suppose your point  was to show me how ridiculous the  whole idea actually is. Very well,  you've done it. Confound it. However,  I suppose your time, even when  spent in this manner, has some value.  Here is fifty dollars. And good day,  sir!\"\n\n\n He slammed the door after him  as he left.\n\n\n Simon winced at the noise, took  the aspirin bottle from its drawer,  took two, washed them down with  water from the desk carafe.\n\n\n Betty looked at him admiringly.  Came to her feet, crossed over and  took up the fifty dollars. \"Week's  wages,\" she said. \"I suppose that's  one way of taking care of a crackpot.  But I'm surprised you didn't  take his money and enjoy that vacation  you've been yearning about.\"\n\n\n \"I did,\" Simon groaned. \"Three  times.\"\n\n\n Betty stared at him. \"You mean\u2014\"\n\n\n Simon nodded, miserably.\n\n\n She said, \"But Simon . Fifty thousand  dollars bonus. If that story was  true, you should have gone back  again to Munich. If there was one  time traveler, there might have  been\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I keep telling you,\" Simon said  bitterly, \"I went back there three  times. There were hundreds of them.  Probably thousands.\" He took a deep  breath. \"Listen, we're just going to  have to forget about it. They're not  going to stand for the space-time  continuum track being altered. If  something comes up that looks like  it might result in the track being  changed, they set you right back at  the beginning and let things start\u2014for  you\u2014all over again. They just  can't allow anything to come back  from the future and change the  past.\"\n\n\n \"You mean,\" Betty was suddenly  furious at him, \"you've given up!  Why this is the biggest thing\u2014 Why  the fifty thousand dollars is nothing.  The future! Just think!\"\n\n\n Simon said wearily, \"There's just  one thing you can bring back with  you from the future, a hangover compounded  of a gallon or so of Marzenbr\u00e4u.  What's more you can pile  one on top of the other, and another  on top of that!\"\n\n\n He shuddered. \"If you think I'm  going to take another crack at this  merry-go-round and pile a fourth  hangover on the three I'm already  nursing, all at once, you can think  again.\" THE END Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Astounding Science Fiction June  1959.

Illustrated by Freas\n\n\n Betty  looked up from  her magazine. She said  mildly, \"You're late.\"\n\n\n \"Don't yell at me, I  feel awful,\" Simon told  her. He sat down at his desk, passed  his tongue over his teeth in distaste,  groaned, fumbled in a drawer for the  aspirin bottle.\n\n\n He looked over at Betty and said,  almost as though reciting, \"What I  need is a vacation.\"\n\n\n \"What,\" Betty said, \"are you going  to use for money?\"\n\n\n \"Providence,\" Simon told her  whilst fiddling with the aspirin bottle,  \"will provide.\"\n\n\n \"Hm-m-m. But before providing  vacations it'd be nice if Providence  turned up a missing jewel deal, say.  Something where you could deduce  that actually the ruby ring had gone  down the drain and was caught in the  elbow. Something that would net  about fifty dollars.\"\n\n\n Simon said, mournful of tone,  \"Fifty dollars? Why not make it five  hundred?\"\n\n\n \"I'm not selfish,\" Betty said. \"All  I want is enough to pay me this  week's salary.\"\n\n\n \"Money,\" Simon said. \"When you  took this job you said it was the romance  that appealed to you.\"\n\n\n \"Hm-m-m. I didn't know most  sleuthing amounted to snooping  around department stores to check on  the clerks knocking down.\"\n\n\n Simon said, enigmatically, \"Now  it comes.\" There was a knock.\n\n\n Betty bounced up with Olympic  agility and had the door swinging  wide before the knocking was quite  completed.\n\n\n He was old, little and had bug  eyes behind pince-nez glasses. His  suit was cut in the style of yesteryear  but when a suit costs two or  three hundred dollars you still retain  caste whatever the styling.\n\n\n Simon said unenthusiastically,  \"Good morning, Mr. Oyster.\" He indicated  the client's chair. \"Sit down,  sir.\"\n\n\n The client fussed himself with  Betty's assistance into the seat, bug-eyed  Simon, said finally, \"You know  my name, that's pretty good. Never  saw you before in my life. Stop fussing  with me, young lady. Your ad  in the phone book says you'll investigate  anything.\"\n\n\n \"Anything,\" Simon said. \"Only  one exception.\"\n\n\n \"Excellent. Do you believe in time  travel?\"\n\n\n Simon said nothing. Across the  room, where she had resumed her  seat, Betty cleared her throat. When  Simon continued to say nothing she  ventured, \"Time travel is impossible.\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, why?\"\n\n\n Betty looked to her boss for assistance.  None was forthcoming. There  ought to be some very quick, positive,  definite answer. She said, \"Well,  for one thing, paradox. Suppose you  had a time machine and traveled back  a hundred years or so and killed your  own great-grandfather. Then how  could you ever be born?\"\n\n\n \"Confound it if I know,\" the little  fellow growled. \"How?\"\n\n\n Simon said, \"Let's get to the point,  what you wanted to see me about.\"\n\n\n \"I want to hire you to hunt me up  some time travelers,\" the old boy  said.\n\n\n Betty was too far in now to maintain  her proper role of silent secretary.  \"Time travelers,\" she said, not  very intelligently.\n\n\n The potential client sat more erect,  obviously with intent to hold the  floor for a time. He removed the  pince-nez glasses and pointed them  at Betty. He said, \"Have you read  much science fiction, Miss?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Betty admitted.\n\n\n \"Then you'll realize that there are  a dozen explanations of the paradoxes  of time travel. Every writer in  the field worth his salt has explained  them away. But to get on. It's my  contention that within a century or  so man will have solved the problems  of immortality and eternal youth, and  it's also my suspicion that he will  eventually be able to travel in time.  So convinced am I of these possibilities  that I am willing to gamble a  portion of my fortune to investigate  the presence in our era of such time  travelers.\"\n\n\n Simon seemed incapable of carrying  the ball this morning, so Betty  said, \"But ... Mr. Oyster, if the  future has developed time travel why  don't we ever meet such travelers?\"\n\n\n Simon put in a word. \"The usual  explanation, Betty, is that they can't  afford to allow the space-time continuum  track to be altered. If, say, a  time traveler returned to a period of  twenty-five years ago and shot Hitler,  then all subsequent history would be  changed. In that case, the time traveler  himself might never be born. They  have to tread mighty carefully.\"\n\n\n Mr. Oyster was pleased. \"I didn't  expect you to be so well informed  on the subject, young man.\"\n\n\n Simon shrugged and fumbled  again with the aspirin bottle. Mr. Oyster went on. \"I've been  considering the matter for some time  and\u2014\"\n\n\n Simon held up a hand. \"There's  no use prolonging this. As I understand  it, you're an elderly gentleman  with a considerable fortune and you  realize that thus far nobody has succeeded  in taking it with him.\"\n\n\n Mr. Oyster returned his glasses to  their perch, bug-eyed Simon, but then  nodded.\n\n\n Simon said, \"You want to hire me  to find a time traveler and in some  manner or other\u2014any manner will  do\u2014exhort from him the secret of  eternal life and youth, which you figure  the future will have discovered.  You're willing to pony up a part of  this fortune of yours, if I can deliver  a bona fide time traveler.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\"\n\n\n Betty had been looking from one  to the other. Now she said, plaintively,  \"But where are you going to find  one of these characters\u2014especially if  they're interested in keeping hid?\"\n\n\n The old boy was the center again.  \"I told you I'd been considering it  for some time. The Oktoberfest ,  that's where they'd be!\" He seemed  elated.\n\n\n Betty and Simon waited.\n\n\n \"The Oktoberfest ,\" he repeated.  \"The greatest festival the world has  ever seen, the carnival, feria , fiesta to beat them all. Every year it's held  in Munich. Makes the New Orleans  Mardi gras look like a quilting  party.\" He began to swing into the  spirit of his description. \"It originally  started in celebration of the wedding  of some local prince a century  and a half ago and the Bavarians had  such a bang-up time they've been  holding it every year since. The  Munich breweries do up a special  beer, Marzenbr\u00e4u they call it, and  each brewery opens a tremendous tent  on the fair grounds which will hold  five thousand customers apiece. Millions  of liters of beer are put away,  hundreds of thousands of barbecued  chickens, a small herd of oxen are  roasted whole over spits, millions of  pair of weisswurst , a very special  sausage, millions upon millions of  pretzels\u2014\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Simon said. \"We'll accept  it. The Oktoberfest is one whale  of a wingding.\" \"Well,\" the old boy pursued, into  his subject now, \"that's where they'd  be, places like the Oktoberfest . For  one thing, a time traveler wouldn't  be conspicuous. At a festival like this  somebody with a strange accent, or  who didn't know exactly how to wear  his clothes correctly, or was off the  ordinary in any of a dozen other  ways, wouldn't be noticed. You could  be a four-armed space traveler from  Mars, and you still wouldn't be conspicuous  at the Oktoberfest . People  would figure they had D.T.'s.\"\n\n\n \"But why would a time traveler  want to go to a\u2014\" Betty began.\n\n\n \"Why not! What better opportunity  to study a people than when they  are in their cups? If you could go  back a few thousand years, the things  you would wish to see would be a  Roman Triumph, perhaps the Rites  of Dionysus, or one of Alexander's  orgies. You wouldn't want to wander  up and down the streets of, say,  Athens while nothing was going on,  particularly when you might be revealed  as a suspicious character not  being able to speak the language, not  knowing how to wear the clothes and  not familiar with the city's layout.\"  He took a deep breath. \"No ma'am,  you'd have to stick to some great  event, both for the sake of actual  interest and for protection against being  unmasked.\"\n\n\n The old boy wound it up. \"Well,  that's the story. What are your rates?  The Oktoberfest starts on Friday and  continues for sixteen days. You can  take the plane to Munich, spend a  week there and\u2014\"\n\n\n Simon was shaking his head. \"Not  interested.\"\n\n\n As soon as Betty had got her jaw  back into place, she glared unbelievingly  at him.\n\n\n Mr. Oyster was taken aback himself.  \"See here, young man, I realize  this isn't an ordinary assignment,  however, as I said, I am willing to  risk a considerable portion of my  fortune\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sorry,\" Simon said. \"Can't be  done.\"\n\n\n \"A hundred dollars a day plus expenses,\"  Mr. Oyster said quietly. \"I  like the fact that you already seem  to have some interest and knowledge  of the matter. I liked the way you  knew my name when I walked in the  door; my picture doesn't appear often  in the papers.\"\n\n\n \"No go,\" Simon said, a sad quality  in his voice.\n\n\n \"A fifty thousand dollar bonus if  you bring me a time traveler.\"\n\n\n \"Out of the question,\" Simon  said.\n\n\n \"But why ?\" Betty wailed.\n\n\n \"Just for laughs,\" Simon told the  two of them sourly, \"suppose I tell  you a funny story. It goes like  this:\" I got a thousand dollars from Mr.  Oyster (Simon began) in the way  of an advance, and leaving him with  Betty who was making out a receipt,  I hustled back to the apartment and  packed a bag. Hell, I'd wanted a vacation  anyway, this was a natural. On  the way to Idlewild I stopped off at  the Germany Information Offices for  some tourist literature.\n\n\n It takes roughly three and a half  hours to get to Gander from Idlewild.  I spent the time planning the  fun I was going to have.\n\n\n It takes roughly seven and a half  hours from Gander to Shannon and  I spent that time dreaming up material  I could put into my reports to  Mr. Oyster. I was going to have to  give him some kind of report for his  money. Time travel yet! What a  laugh!\n\n\n Between Shannon and Munich a  faint suspicion began to simmer in  my mind. These statistics I read on  the Oktoberfest in the Munich tourist  pamphlets. Five million people  attended annually.\n\n\n Where did five million people  come from to attend an overgrown  festival in comparatively remote  Southern Germany? The tourist season  is over before September 21st,  first day of the gigantic beer bust.  Nor could the Germans account for  any such number. Munich itself has  a population of less than a million,  counting children.\n\n\n And those millions of gallons of  beer, the hundreds of thousands of  chickens, the herds of oxen. Who  ponied up all the money for such expenditures?  How could the average  German, with his twenty-five dollars  a week salary?\n\n\n In Munich there was no hotel  space available. I went to the Bahnhof  where they have a hotel service  and applied. They put my name  down, pocketed the husky bribe,  showed me where I could check my  bag, told me they'd do what they  could, and to report back in a few  hours.\n\n\n I had another suspicious twinge.  If five million people attended this  beer bout, how were they accommodated?\n\n\n The Theresienwiese , the fair  ground, was only a few blocks  away. I was stiff from the plane ride  so I walked. There are seven major brewers in  the Munich area, each of them represented  by one of the circuslike tents  that Mr. Oyster mentioned. Each tent  contained benches and tables for  about five thousand persons and from  six to ten thousands pack themselves  in, competing for room. In the center  is a tremendous bandstand, the  musicians all lederhosen clad, the  music as Bavarian as any to be found  in a Bavarian beer hall. Hundreds of  peasant garbed fr\u00e4uleins darted about  the tables with quart sized earthenware  mugs, platters of chicken, sausage,  kraut and pretzels.\n\n\n I found a place finally at a table  which had space for twenty-odd beer  bibbers. Odd is right. As weird an  assortment of Germans and foreign  tourists as could have been dreamed  up, ranging from a seventy- or  eighty-year-old couple in Bavarian  costume, to the bald-headed drunk  across the table from me.\n\n\n A desperate waitress bearing six  mugs of beer in each hand scurried  past. They call them masses , by the  way, not mugs. The bald-headed  character and I both held up a finger  and she slid two of the masses over  to us and then hustled on.\n\n\n \"Down the hatch,\" the other said,  holding up his mass in toast.\n\n\n \"To the ladies,\" I told him. Before  sipping, I said, \"You know, the  tourist pamphlets say this stuff is  eighteen per cent. That's nonsense.  No beer is that strong.\" I took a long  pull.\n\n\n He looked at me, waiting.\n\n\n I came up. \"Mistaken,\" I admitted.\n\n\n A mass or two apiece later he looked  carefully at the name engraved on  his earthenware mug. \"L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u,\"  he said. He took a small notebook  from his pocket and a pencil, noted  down the word and returned the  things.\n\n\n \"That's a queer looking pencil you  have there,\" I told him. \"German?\"\n\n\n \"Venusian,\" he said. \"Oops, sorry.  Shouldn't have said that.\"\n\n\n I had never heard of the brand so  I skipped it.\n\n\n \"Next is the Hofbr\u00e4u,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Next what?\" Baldy's conversation  didn't seem to hang together very  well.\n\n\n \"My pilgrimage,\" he told me. \"All  my life I've been wanting to go back  to an Oktoberfest and sample every  one of the seven brands of the best  beer the world has ever known. I'm  only as far as L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u. I'm afraid  I'll never make it.\"\n\n\n I finished my mass . \"I'll help  you,\" I told him. \"Very noble endeavor.  Name is Simon.\"\n\n\n \"Arth,\" he said. \"How could you  help?\"\n\n\n \"I'm still fresh\u2014comparatively.  I'll navigate you around. There are  seven beer tents. How many have you  got through, so far?\"\n\n\n \"Two, counting this one,\" Arth  said.\n\n\n I looked at him. \"It's going to be  a chore,\" I said. \"You've already got  a nice edge on.\"\n\n\n Outside, as we made our way to  the next tent, the fair looked like  every big State-Fair ever seen, except  it was bigger. Games, souvenir  stands, sausage stands, rides, side  shows, and people, people, people.\n\n\n The Hofbr\u00e4u tent was as overflowing  as the last but we managed to  find two seats.\n\n\n The band was blaring, and five  thousand half-swacked voices were  roaring accompaniment. In Muenchen steht ein Hofbr\u00e4uhaus! Eins, Zwei, G'sufa! At the G'sufa everybody upped  with the mugs and drank each other's  health.\n\n\n \"This is what I call a real beer  bust,\" I said approvingly.\n\n\n Arth was waving to a waitress. As  in the L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u tent, a full quart  was the smallest amount obtainable.\n\n\n A beer later I said, \"I don't know  if you'll make it or not, Arth.\"\n\n\n \"Make what?\"\n\n\n \"All seven tents.\"\n\n\n \"Oh.\"\n\n\n A waitress was on her way by,  mugs foaming over their rims. I gestured  to her for refills.\n\n\n \"Where are you from, Arth?\" I  asked him, in the way of making  conversation.\n\n\n \"2183.\"\n\n\n \"2183 where?\"\n\n\n He looked at me, closing one eye  to focus better. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Well,  2183 South Street, ah, New Albuquerque.\"\n\n\n \"New Albuquerque? Where's  that?\"\n\n\n Arth thought about it. Took another  long pull at the beer. \"Right  across the way from old Albuquerque,\"  he said finally. \"Maybe we  ought to be getting on to the  Pschorrbr\u00e4u tent.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe we ought to eat something  first,\" I said. \"I'm beginning to feel  this. We could get some of that barbecued  ox.\"\n\n\n Arth closed his eyes in pain.  \"Vegetarian,\" he said. \"Couldn't possibly  eat meat. Barbarous. Ugh.\"\n\n\n \"Well, we need some nourishment,\"  I said.\n\n\n \"There's supposed to be considerable  nourishment in beer.\"\n\n\n That made sense. I yelled, \" Fr\u00e4ulein!  Zwei neu bier! \" Somewhere along in here the fog  rolled in. When it rolled out again,  I found myself closing one eye the  better to read the lettering on my  earthenware mug. It read Augustinerbr\u00e4u.  Somehow we'd evidently  navigated from one tent to another.\n\n\n Arth was saying, \"Where's your  hotel?\"\n\n\n That seemed like a good question.  I thought about it for a while. Finally  I said, \"Haven't got one. Town's  jam packed. Left my bag at the Bahnhof.  I don't think we'll ever make  it, Arth. How many we got to  go?\"\n\n\n \"Lost track,\" Arth said. \"You can  come home with me.\"\n\n\n We drank to that and the fog rolled  in again.\n\n\n When the fog rolled out, it was  daylight. Bright, glaring, awful daylight.  I was sprawled, complete with  clothes, on one of twin beds. On the  other bed, also completely clothed,  was Arth.\n\n\n That sun was too much. I stumbled  up from the bed, staggered to  the window and fumbled around for  a blind or curtain. There was none.\n\n\n Behind me a voice said in horror,  \"Who ... how ... oh, Wodo ,  where'd you come from?\"\n\n\n I got a quick impression, looking  out the window, that the Germans  were certainly the most modern, futuristic  people in the world. But I  couldn't stand the light. \"Where's  the shade,\" I moaned.\n\n\n Arth did something and the window  went opaque.\n\n\n \"That's quite a gadget,\" I groaned.  \"If I didn't feel so lousy, I'd  appreciate it.\"\n\n\n Arth was sitting on the edge of  the bed holding his bald head in his  hands. \"I remember now,\" he sorrowed.  \"You didn't have a hotel.  What a stupidity. I'll be phased.  Phased all the way down.\"\n\n\n \"You haven't got a handful of  aspirin, have you?\" I asked him.\n\n\n \"Just a minute,\" Arth said, staggering  erect and heading for what  undoubtedly was a bathroom. \"Stay  where you are. Don't move. Don't  touch anything.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" I told him plaintively.  \"I'm clean. I won't mess up the  place. All I've got is a hangover, not  lice.\"\n\n\n Arth was gone. He came back in  two or three minutes, box of pills in  hand. \"Here, take one of these.\"\n\n\n I took the pill, followed it with a  glass of water. And went out like a light.\n\n\n Arth was shaking my arm. \"Want  another mass ?\"\n\n\n The band was blaring, and five  thousand half-swacked voices were  roaring accompaniment. In Muenchen steht ein Hofbr\u00e4uhaus! Eins, Zwei, G'sufa! At the G'sufa everybody upped  with their king-size mugs and drank  each other's health.\n\n\n My head was killing me. \"This is  where I came in, or something,\" I  groaned.\n\n\n Arth said, \"That was last night.\"  He looked at me over the rim of his  beer mug.\n\n\n Something, somewhere, was  wrong. But I didn't care. I finished  my mass and then remembered. \"I've  got to get my bag. Oh, my head.  Where did we spend last night?\"\n\n\n Arth said, and his voice sounded  cautious, \"At my hotel, don't you remember?\"\n\n\n \"Not very well,\" I admitted. \"I  feel lousy. I must have dimmed out.  I've got to go to the Bahnhof and  get my luggage.\"\n\n\n Arth didn't put up an argument  on that. We said good-by and I could  feel him watching after me as I pushed  through the tables on the way  out.\n\n\n At the Bahnhof they could do me  no good. There were no hotel rooms  available in Munich. The head was  getting worse by the minute. The  fact that they'd somehow managed  to lose my bag didn't help. I worked  on that project for at least a couple  of hours. Not only wasn't the bag  at the luggage checking station, but  the attendant there evidently couldn't  make heads nor tails of the check  receipt. He didn't speak English and  my high school German was inadequate,  especially accompanied by a  blockbusting hangover.\n\n\n I didn't get anywhere tearing my  hair and complaining from one end  of the Bahnhof to the other. I drew  a blank on the bag.\n\n\n And the head was getting worse  by the minute. I was bleeding to  death through the eyes and instead  of butterflies I had bats in my stomach.  Believe me, nobody should drink  a gallon or more of Marzenbr\u00e4u. I decided the hell with it. I took  a cab to the airport, presented my return  ticket, told them I wanted to  leave on the first obtainable plane to  New York. I'd spent two days at the Oktoberfest , and I'd had it.\n\n\n I got more guff there. Something  was wrong with the ticket, wrong  date or some such. But they fixed  that up. I never was clear on what  was fouled up, some clerk's error,  evidently.\n\n\n The trip back was as uninteresting  as the one over. As the hangover began  to wear off\u2014a little\u2014I was almost  sorry I hadn't been able to stay.  If I'd only been able to get a room I would have stayed, I told myself.\n\n\n From Idlewild, I came directly to  the office rather than going to my  apartment. I figured I might as well  check in with Betty.\n\n\n I opened the door and there I  found Mr. Oyster sitting in the chair  he had been occupying four\u2014or was  it five\u2014days before when I'd left.  I'd lost track of the time.\n\n\n I said to him, \"Glad you're here,  sir. I can report. Ah, what was it  you came for? Impatient to hear if  I'd had any results?\" My mind was  spinning like a whirling dervish in  a revolving door. I'd spent a wad of  his money and had nothing I could  think of to show for it; nothing but  the last stages of a grand-daddy  hangover.\n\n\n \"Came for?\" Mr. Oyster snorted.  \"I'm merely waiting for your girl to  make out my receipt. I thought you  had already left.\"\n\n\n \"You'll miss your plane,\" Betty  said.\n\n\n There was suddenly a double dip  of ice cream in my stomach. I walked  over to my desk and looked down at  the calendar.\n\n\n Mr. Oyster was saying something  to the effect that if I didn't leave today,  it would have to be tomorrow,  that he hadn't ponied up that thousand  dollars advance for anything  less than immediate service. Stuffing  his receipt in his wallet, he fussed  his way out the door.\n\n\n I said to Betty hopefully, \"I suppose  you haven't changed this calendar  since I left.\"\n\n\n Betty said, \"What's the matter  with you? You look funny. How did  your clothes get so mussed? You tore  the top sheet off that calendar yourself,  not half an hour ago, just before  this marble-missing client came  in.\" She added, irrelevantly, \"Time  travelers yet.\"\n\n\n I tried just once more. \"Uh, when  did you first see this Mr. Oyster?\"\n\n\n \"Never saw him before in my  life,\" she said. \"Not until he came  in this morning.\"\n\n\n \"This morning,\" I said weakly.\n\n\n While Betty stared at me as though  it was me that needed candling by a  head shrinker preparatory to being  sent off to a pressure cooker, I fished  in my pocket for my wallet, counted  the contents and winced at the  pathetic remains of the thousand.  I said pleadingly, \"Betty, listen,  how long ago did I go out that door\u2014on  the way to the airport?\"\n\n\n \"You've been acting sick all morning.  You went out that door about  ten minutes ago, were gone about  three minutes, and then came back.\" \"See here,\" Mr. Oyster said (interrupting  Simon's story), \"did you  say this was supposed to be amusing,  young man? I don't find it so. In  fact, I believe I am being ridiculed.\"\n\n\n Simon shrugged, put one hand to  his forehead and said, \"That's only  the first chapter. There are two  more.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not interested in more,\" Mr.  Oyster said. \"I suppose your point  was to show me how ridiculous the  whole idea actually is. Very well,  you've done it. Confound it. However,  I suppose your time, even when  spent in this manner, has some value.  Here is fifty dollars. And good day,  sir!\"\n\n\n He slammed the door after him  as he left.\n\n\n Simon winced at the noise, took  the aspirin bottle from its drawer,  took two, washed them down with  water from the desk carafe.\n\n\n Betty looked at him admiringly.  Came to her feet, crossed over and  took up the fifty dollars. \"Week's  wages,\" she said. \"I suppose that's  one way of taking care of a crackpot.  But I'm surprised you didn't  take his money and enjoy that vacation  you've been yearning about.\"\n\n\n \"I did,\" Simon groaned. \"Three  times.\"\n\n\n Betty stared at him. \"You mean\u2014\"\n\n\n Simon nodded, miserably.\n\n\n She said, \"But Simon . Fifty thousand  dollars bonus. If that story was  true, you should have gone back  again to Munich. If there was one  time traveler, there might have  been\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I keep telling you,\" Simon said  bitterly, \"I went back there three  times. There were hundreds of them.  Probably thousands.\" He took a deep  breath. \"Listen, we're just going to  have to forget about it. They're not  going to stand for the space-time  continuum track being altered. If  something comes up that looks like  it might result in the track being  changed, they set you right back at  the beginning and let things start\u2014for  you\u2014all over again. They just  can't allow anything to come back  from the future and change the  past.\"\n\n\n \"You mean,\" Betty was suddenly  furious at him, \"you've given up!  Why this is the biggest thing\u2014 Why  the fifty thousand dollars is nothing.  The future! Just think!\"\n\n\n Simon said wearily, \"There's just  one thing you can bring back with  you from the future, a hangover compounded  of a gallon or so of Marzenbr\u00e4u.  What's more you can pile  one on top of the other, and another  on top of that!\"\n\n\n He shuddered. \"If you think I'm  going to take another crack at this  merry-go-round and pile a fourth  hangover on the three I'm already  nursing, all at once, you can think  again.\" THE END Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Astounding Science Fiction June  1959.
