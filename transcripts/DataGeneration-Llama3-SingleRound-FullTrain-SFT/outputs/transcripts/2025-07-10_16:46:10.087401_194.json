DE VET\nmonkey on his back\nUnder the cloud of cast-off identities\n  \n lay the shape of another man\u2014\n  \n was it himself?\nIllustrated by DILLON\nHE was walking endlessly\n down a long, glass-walled\n corridor. Bright sunlight\n slanted in through one wall, on the\n blue knapsack across his shoulders.\n Who he was, and what he was doing\n here, was clouded. The truth lurked\n in some corner of his consciousness,\n but it was not reached by surface\n awareness.\n\n\n The corridor opened at last into\n a large high-domed room, much\n like a railway station or an air terminal.\n He walked straight ahead.\n\n\n At the sight of him a man leaning\n negligently against a stone pillar,\n to his right but within vision,\n straightened and barked an order\n to him, \u201cHalt!\u201d He lengthened his\n stride but gave no other sign.\n\n\n [p\n 136\n ]\n\n Two men hurried through a\n doorway of a small anteroom to his\n left, calling to him. He turned away\n and began to run.\n\n\n Shouts and the sound of charging\n feet came from behind him. He\n cut to the right, running toward the\n escalator to the second floor. Another\n pair of men were hurrying\n down, two steps at a stride. With\n no break in pace he veered into an\n opening beside the escalator.\n\n\n At the first turn he saw that the\n aisle merely circled the stairway,\n coming out into the depot again on\n the other side. It was a trap. He\n glanced quickly around him.\n\n\n At the rear of the space was a\n row of lockers for traveler use. He\n slipped a coin into a pay slot,\n opened the zipper on his bag and\n pulled out a flat briefcase. It took\n him only a few seconds to push the\n case into the compartment, lock it\n and slide the key along the floor\n beneath the locker.\n\n\n There was nothing to do after\n that\u2014except wait.\n\n\n The men pursuing him came\n hurtling around the turn in the\n aisle. He kicked his knapsack to\n one side, spreading his feet wide\n with an instinctive motion.\n\n\n Until that instant he had intended\n to fight. Now he swiftly\n reassessed the odds. There were\n five of them, he saw. He should be\n able to incapacitate two or three\n and break out. But the fact that\n they had been expecting him meant\n that others would very probably\n be waiting outside. His best course\n now was to sham ignorance. He\n relaxed.\n\n\n He offered no resistance as they\n reached him.\n\n\n They were not gentle men. A tall\n ruffian, copper-brown face damp\n with perspiration and body oil,\n grabbed him by the jacket and\n slammed him back against the\n lockers. As he shifted his weight\n to keep his footing someone drove\n a fist into his face. He started to\n raise his hands; and a hard flat\n object crashed against the side of\n his skull.\n\n\n The starch went out of his legs.\n\u201cD\n O you make anything out of\n it?\u201d the psychoanalyst Milton\n Bergstrom, asked.\n\n\n John Zarwell shook his head.\n \u201cDid I talk while I was under?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, yes. You were supposed to.\n That way I follow pretty well what\n you\u2019re reenacting.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHow does it tie in with what I\n told you before?\u201d\n\n\n Bergstrom\u2019s neat-boned, fair-skinned\n face betrayed no emotion\n other than an introspective stillness\n of his normally alert gaze. \u201cI see\n no connection,\u201d he decided, his\n words once again precise and meticulous.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough to\n go on. Do you feel able to try another\n comanalysis this afternoon\n yet?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d Zarwell\n [p\n 137\n ]\n opened the collar of his shirt. The\n day was hot, and the room had no\n air conditioning, still a rare luxury\n on St. Martin\u2019s. The office window\n was open, but it let in no freshness,\n only the mildly rank odor that pervaded\n all the planet\u2019s habitable\n area.\n\n\n \u201cGood.\u201d Bergstrom rose. \u201cThe\n serum is quite harmless, John.\u201d He\n maintained a professional diversionary\n chatter as he administered\n the drug. \u201cA scopolamine derivative\n that\u2019s been well tested.\u201d\n\n\n The floor beneath Zarwell\u2019s feet\n assumed abruptly the near transfluent\n consistency of a damp\n sponge. It rose in a foot-high wave\n and rolled gently toward the far\n wall.\n\n\n Bergstrom continued talking,\n with practiced urbanity. \u201cWhen\n psychiatry was a less exact science,\u201d\n his voice went on, seeming to come\n from a great distance, \u201ca doctor\n had to spend weeks, sometimes\n months or years interviewing a\n patient. If he was skilled enough,\n he could sort the relevancies from\n the vast amount of chaff. We are\n able now, with the help of the\n serum, to confine our discourses to\n matters cogent to the patient\u2019s\n trouble.\u201d\n\n\n The floor continued its transmutation,\n and Zarwell sank deep into\n viscous depths. \u201cLie back and relax.\n Don\u2019t\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\n\n The words tumbled down from\n above. They faded, were gone.\nZARWELL found himself\nstanding on a vast plain. There was\n no sky above, and no horizon in the\n distance. He was in a place without\n space or dimension. There was\n nothing here except himself\u2014and\n the gun that he held in his hand.\n\n\n A weapon beautiful in its efficient\n simplicity.\n\n\n He should know all about the\n instrument, its purpose and workings,\n but he could not bring his\n thoughts into rational focus. His\n forehead creased with his mental\n effort.\n\n\n Abruptly the unreality about\n him shifted perspective. He was\n approaching\u2014not walking, but\n merely shortening the space between\n them\u2014the man who held\n the gun. The man who was himself.\n The other \u201chimself\u201d drifted\n nearer also, as though drawn by a\n mutual attraction.\n\n\n The man with the gun raised his\n weapon and pressed the trigger.\n\n\n With the action the perspective\n shifted again. He was watching the\n face of the man he shot jerk and\n twitch, expand and contract. The\n face was unharmed, yet it was no\n longer the same. No longer his own\n features.\n\n\n The stranger face smiled approvingly\n at him.\n\u201cO\n DD,\u201d Bergstrom said.\nHe brought his hands up and joined\n the tips of his fingers against his\n chest. \u201cBut it\u2019s another piece in the\n [p\n 138\n ]\n jig-saw. In time it will fit into\n place.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt means no\n more to you than the first, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo,\u201d Zarwell answered.\n\n\n He was not a talking man, Bergstrom\n reflected. It was more than\n reticence, however. The man had\n a hard granite core, only partially\n concealed by his present perplexity.\n He was a man who could handle\n himself well in an emergency.\n\n\n Bergstrom shrugged, dismissing\n his strayed thoughts. \u201cI expected\n as much. A quite normal first phase\n of treatment.\u201d He straightened a\n paper on his desk. \u201cI think that will\n be enough for today. Twice in one\n sitting is about all we ever try.\n Otherwise some particular episode\n might cause undue mental stress,\n and set up a block.\u201d He glanced\n down at his appointment pad. \u201cTomorrow\n at two, then?\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell grunted acknowledgment\n and pushed himself to his\n feet, apparently unaware that his\n shirt clung damply to his body.\nTHE sun was still high when\n Zarwell left the analyst\u2019s office.\n The white marble of the city\u2019s\n buildings shimmered in the afternoon\n heat, squat and austere as\n giant tree trunks, pock-marked and\n gray-mottled with windows. Zarwell\n was careful not to rest his hand\n on the flesh searing surface of the\n stone.\n\n\n The evening meal hour was approaching\n when he reached the\n Flats, on the way to his apartment.\n The streets of the old section were\n near-deserted. The only sounds he\n heard as he passed were the occasional\n cry of a baby, chronically\n uncomfortable in the day\u2019s heat,\n and the lowing of imported cattle\n waiting in a nearby shed to be\n shipped to the country.\n\n\n All St. Martin\u2019s has a distinctive\n smell, as of an arid dried-out\n swamp, with a faint taint of fish.\n But in the Flats the odor changes.\n Here is the smell of factories, warehouses,\n and trading marts; the smell\n of stale cooking drifting from the\n homes of the laborers and lower\n class techmen who live there.\n\n\n Zarwell passed a group of\n smaller children playing a desultory\n game of lic-lic for pieces of\n candy and cigarettes. Slowly he\n climbed the stairs of a stone flat.\n He prepared a supper for himself\n and ate it without either enjoyment\n or distaste. He lay down, fully\n clothed, on his bed. The visit to the\n analyst had done nothing to dispel\n his ennui.\n[p\n 139\n ]\n\n\n\n The next morning when Zarwell\n awoke he lay for a moment, unmoving.\n The feeling was there\n again, like a scene waiting only to\n be gazed at directly to be perceived.\n It was as though a great wisdom\n lay at the edge of understanding.\n If he rested quietly it would\n all come to him. Yet always, when\n his mind lost its sleep-induced\n [p\n 140\n ]\n lethargy, the moment of near understanding\n slipped away.\n\n\n This morning, however, the sense\n of disorientation did not pass with\n full wakefulness. He achieved no\n understanding, but the strangeness\n did not leave as he sat up.\n\n\n He gazed about him. The room\n did not seem to be his own. The\n furnishings, and the clothing he observed\n in a closet, might have belonged\n to a stranger.\n\n\n He pulled himself from his blankets,\n his body moving with mechanical\n reaction. The slippers into\n which he put his feet were larger\n than he had expected them to be.\n He walked about the small apartment.\n The place was familiar, but\n only as it would have been if he\n had studied it from blueprints, not\n as though he lived there.\n\n\n The feeling was still with him\n when he returned to the psychoanalyst.\nTHE scene this time was more\n kaleidoscopic, less personal.\n\n\n A village was being ravaged.\n Men struggled and died in the\n streets. Zarwell moved among\n them, seldom taking part in the\n individual clashes, yet a moving\n force in the\n conflict\n .\n\n\n The background changed. He\n understood that he was on a different\n world.\n\n\n Here a city burned. Its resistance\n was nearing its end. Zarwell was\n riding a shaggy pony outside a high\n wall surrounding the stricken metropolis.\n He moved in and joined a\n party of short, bearded men, directing\n them as they battered at the\n wall with a huge log mounted on a\n many-wheeled truck.\n\n\n The log broke a breach in the\n concrete and the besiegers charged\n through, carrying back the defenders\n who sought vainly to plug the\n gap. Soon there would be rioting\n in the streets again, plundering and\n killing.\n\n\n Zarwell was not the leader of the\n invaders, only a lesser figure in the\n rebellion. But he had played a leading\n part in the planning of the\n strategy that led to the city\u2019s fall.\n The job had been well done.\n\n\n Time passed, without visible\n break in the panorama. Now Zarwell\n was fleeing, pursued by the\n same bearded men who had been\n his comrades before. Still he moved\n with the same firm purpose, vigilant,\n resourceful, and well prepared\n for the eventuality that had befallen.\n He made his escape without\n difficulty.\n\n\n He alighted from a space ship on\n still another world\u2014another shift\n in time\u2014and the atmosphere of\n conflict engulfed him.\n\n\n Weary but resigned he accepted\n it, and did what he had to do\u00a0\u2026\nBERGSTROM was regarding\nhim with speculative scrutiny.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve had quite a past, apparently,\u201d\n he observed.\n\n\n [p\n 141\n ]\n\n Zarwell smiled with mild embarrassment.\n \u201cAt least in my dreams.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cDreams?\u201d Bergstrom\u2019s eyes\n widened in surprise. \u201cOh, I beg your\n pardon. I must have forgotten to\n explain. This work is so routine to\n me that sometimes I forget it\u2019s all\n new to a patient. Actually what you\n experienced under the drug were\n not dreams. They were recollections\n of real episodes from your\n past.\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell\u2019s expression became\n wary. He watched Bergstrom\n closely. After a minute, however,\n he seemed satisfied, and he let himself\n settle back against the cushion\n of his chair. \u201cI remember nothing\n of what I saw,\u201d he observed.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here, you\n know,\u201d Bergstrom answered. \u201cTo\n help you remember.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut everything under the drug\n is so\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHaphazard? That\u2019s true. The\n recall episodes are always purely\n random, with no chronological sequence.\n Our problem will be to reassemble\n them in proper order\n later. Or some particular scene may\n trigger a complete memory return.\n\n\n \u201cIt is my considered opinion,\u201d\n Bergstrom went on, \u201cthat your lost\n memory will turn out to be no ordinary\n amnesia. I believe we will find\n that your mind has been tampered\n with.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNothing I\u2019ve seen under the\n drug fits into the past I do remember.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s what makes me so certain,\u201d\n Bergstrom said confidently.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t remember what we\n have shown to be true. Conversely\n then, what you think you remember\n must be false. It must have been\n implanted there. But we can go\n into that later. For today I think\n we have done enough. This episode\n was quite prolonged.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI won\u2019t have any time off again\n until next week end,\u201d Zarwell reminded\n him.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Bergstrom\n thought for a moment. \u201cWe\n shouldn\u2019t let this hang too long.\n Could you come here after work\n tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI suppose I could.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cFine,\u201d Bergstrom said with satisfaction.\n \u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m considerably\n more than casually interested\n in your case by this time.\u201d\nA WORK truck picked Zarwell\n up the next morning and he\n rode with a tech crew to the edge of\n the reclam area. Beside the belt\n bringing ocean muck from the converter\n plant at the seashore his\n bulldozer was waiting.\n\n\n He took his place behind the\n drive wheel and began working dirt\n down between windbreakers anchored\n in the rock. Along a makeshift\n road into the badlands trucks\n brought crushed lime and phosphorus\n to supplement the ocean\n sediment. The progress of life from\n the sea to the land was a mechanical\n [p\n 142\n ]\n process of this growing world.\n\n\n Nearly two hundred years ago,\n when Earth established a colony on\n St. Martin\u2019s, the land surface of the\n planet had been barren. Only its\n seas thrived with animal and vegetable\n life. The necessary machinery\n and technicians had been supplied\n by Earth, and the long struggle began\n to fit the world for human\n needs. When Zarwell arrived, six\n months before, the vitalized area\n already extended three hundred\n miles along the coast, and sixty\n miles inland. And every day the\n progress continued. A large percentage\n of the energy and resources\n of the world were devoted to that\n essential expansion.\n\n\n The reclam crews filled and\n sodded the sterile rock, planted\n binding grasses, grain and trees, and\n diverted rivers to keep it fertile.\n When there were no rivers to divert\n they blasted out springs and lakes\n in the foothills to make their own.\n Biologists developed the necessary\n germ and insect life from what they\n found in the sea. Where that failed,\n they imported microorganisms\n from Earth.\n\n\n Three rubber-tracked crawlers\n picked their way down from the\n mountains until they joined the\n road passing the belt. They were\n loaded with ore that would be\n smelted into metal for depleted\n Earth, or for other colonies short\n of minerals. It was St. Martin\u2019s only\n export thus far.\n\n\n Zarwell pulled his sun helmet\n lower, to better guard his hot, dry\n features. The wind blew continuously\n on St. Martin\u2019s, but it furnished\n small relief from the heat.\n After its three-thousand-mile journey\n across scorched sterile rock, it\n sucked the moisture from a man\u2019s\n body, bringing a membrane-shrinking\n dryness to the nostrils as it was\n breathed in. With it came also the\n cloying taste of limestone in a\n worker\u2019s mouth.\n\n\n Zarwell gazed idly about at the\n other laborers. Fully three-quarters\n of them were beri-rabza ridden. A\n cure for the skin fungus had not\n yet been found; the men\u2019s faces\n and hands were scabbed and red.\n The colony had grown to near self-sufficiency,\n would soon have a moderate\n prosperity, yet they still\n lacked adequate medical and research\n facilities.\n\n\n Not all the world\u2019s citizens were\n content.\n\n\n Bergstrom was waiting in his office\n when Zarwell arrived that\n evening.\nHE was lying motionless on a\n hard cot, with his eyes closed,\n yet with his every sense sharply\n quickened. Tentatively he tightened\n small muscles in his arms and\n legs. Across his wrists and thighs\n he felt straps binding him to the\n cot.\n\n\n \u201cSo that\u2019s our big, bad man,\u201d a\n coarse voice above him observed\n [p\n 143\n ]\n caustically. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look so\n tough now, does he?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt might have been better to\n kill him right away,\u201d a second, less\n confident voice said. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed\n to be impossible to hold him.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. We just do\n what we\u2019re told. We\u2019ll hold him.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat do you think they\u2019ll do\n with him?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cExecute him, I suppose,\u201d the\n harsh voice said matter-of-factly.\n \u201cThey\u2019re probably just curious to\n see what he looks like first. They\u2019ll\n be disappointed.\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell opened his eyes a slit to\n observe his surroundings.\n\n\n It was a mistake. \u201cHe\u2019s out of\n it,\u201d the first speaker said, and Zarwell\n allowed his eyes to open fully.\n\n\n The voice, he saw, belonged to\n the big man who had bruised him\n against the locker at the spaceport.\n Irrelevantly he wondered how he\n knew now that it had been a spaceport.\n\n\n His captor\u2019s broad face jeered\n down at Zarwell. \u201cHave a good\n sleep?\u201d he asked with mock solicitude.\n Zarwell did not deign to acknowledge\n that he heard.\n\n\n The big man turned. \u201cYou can\n tell the Chief he\u2019s awake,\u201d he said.\n Zarwell followed his gaze to where\n a younger man, with a blond lock of\n hair on his forehead, stood behind\n him. The youth nodded and went\n out, while the other pulled a chair\n up to the side of Zarwell\u2019s cot.\n\n\n While their attention was away\n from him Zarwell had unobtrusively\n loosened his bonds as much as\n possible with arm leverage. As the\n big man drew his chair nearer, he\n made the hand farthest from him\n tight and compact and worked it\n free of the leather loop. He waited.\n\n\n The big man belched. \u201cYou\u2019re\n supposed to be great stuff in a situation\n like this,\u201d he said, his smoke-tan\n face splitting in a grin that revealed\n large square teeth. \u201cHow\n about giving me a sample?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou\u2019re a yellow-livered bastard,\u201d\n Zarwell told him.\n\n\n The grin faded from the oily face\n as the man stood up. He leaned over\n the cot\u2014and Zarwell\u2019s left hand\n shot up and locked about his throat,\n joined almost immediately by the\n right.\n\n\n The man\u2019s mouth opened and he\n tried to yell as he threw himself\n frantically backward. He clawed at\n the hands about his neck. When\n that failed to break the grip he suddenly\n reversed his weight and\n drove his fist at Zarwell\u2019s head.\n\n\n Zarwell pulled the struggling\n body down against his chest and\n held it there until all agitated\n movement ceased. He sat up then,\n letting the body slide to the floor.\n\n\n The straps about his thighs came\n loose with little effort.\nTHE analyst dabbed at his upper\n lip with a handkerchief. \u201cThe\n episodes are beginning to tie together,\u201d\n he said, with an attempt at\n [p\n 144\n ]\n nonchalance. \u201cThe next couple\n should do it.\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell did not answer. His\n memory seemed on the point of\n complete return, and he sat quietly,\n hopefully. However, nothing more\n came and he returned his attention\n to his more immediate problem.\n\n\n Opening a button on his shirt, he\n pulled back a strip of plastic cloth\n just below his rib cage and took\n out a small flat pistol. He held it\n in the palm of his hand. He knew\n now why he always carried it.\n\n\n Bergstrom had his bad moment.\n \u201cYou\u2019re not going to\u00a0\u2026\u201d he began\n at the sight of the gun. He tried\n again. \u201cYou must be joking.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI have very little sense of humor,\u201d\n Zarwell corrected him.\n\n\n \u201cYou\u2019d be foolish!\u201d\n\n\n Bergstrom obviously realized\n how close he was to death. Yet\n surprisingly, after the first start,\n he showed little fear. Zarwell had\n thought the man a bit soft, too\n adjusted to a life of ease and some\n prestige to meet danger calmly.\n Curiosity restrained his trigger finger.\n\n\n \u201cWhy would I be foolish?\u201d he\n asked. \u201cYour Meninger oath of inviolable\n confidence?\u201d\n\n\n Bergstrom shook his head. \u201cI\n know it\u2019s been broken before. But\n you need me. You\u2019re not through,\n you know. If you killed me you\u2019d\n still have to trust some other\n analyst.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIs that the best you can do?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo.\u201d Bergstrom was angry now.\n \u201cBut use that logical mind you\u2019re\n supposed to have! Scenes before\n this have shown what kind of man\n you are. Just because this last happened\n here on St. Martin\u2019s makes\n little difference. If I was going to\n turn you in to the police, I\u2019d have\n done it before this.\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell debated with himself the\n truth of what the other had said.\n \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you turn me in?\u201d he\n asked.\n\n\n \u201cBecause you\u2019re no mad-dog\n killer!\u201d Now that the crisis seemed\n to be past, Bergstrom spoke more\n calmly, even allowed himself to\n relax. \u201cYou\u2019re still pretty much in\n the fog about yourself. I read more\n in those comanalyses than you did.\n I even know who you are!\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell\u2019s eyebrows raised.\n\n\n \u201cWho am I?\u201d he asked, very interested\n now. Without attention he\n put his pistol away in a trouser\n pocket.\n\n\n Bergstrom brushed the question\n aside with one hand. \u201cYour name\n makes little difference. You\u2019ve used\n many. But you are an idealist. Your\n killings were necessary to bring\n justice to the places you visited. By\n now you\u2019re almost a legend among\n the human worlds. I\u2019d like to talk\n more with you on that later.\u201d\n\n\n While Zarwell considered, Bergstrom\n pressed his advantage. \u201cOne\n more scene might do it,\u201d he said.\n \u201cShould we try again\u2014if you trust\n me, that is?\u201d\n\n\n [p\n 145\n ]\n\n Zarwell made his decision quickly.\n \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he answered.\nALL Zarwell\u2019s attention seemed\n on the cigar he lit as he rode\n down the escalator, but he surveyed\n the terminal carefully over the rim\n of his hand. He spied no suspicious\n loungers.\n\n\n Behind the escalator he groped\n along the floor beneath the lockers\n until he found his key. The briefcase\n was under his arm a minute\n later.\n\n\n In the basement lave he put a\n coin in the pay slot of a private\n compartment and went in.\n\n\n As he zipped open the briefcase\n he surveyed his features in the mirror.\n A small muscle at the corner of\n one eye twitched spasmodically.\n One cheek wore a frozen quarter\n smile. Thirty-six hours under the\n paralysis was longer than advisable.\n The muscles should be rested at\n least every twenty hours.\n\n\n Fortunately his natural features\n would serve as an adequate disguise\n now.\n\n\n He adjusted the ring setting on\n the pistol-shaped instrument that\n he took from his case, and carefully\n rayed several small areas of\n his face, loosening muscles that had\n been tight too long. He sighed\n gratefully when he finished, massaging\n his cheeks and forehead with\n considerable pleasure. Another\n glance in the mirror satisfied him\n with the changes that had been\n made. He turned to his briefcase\n again and exchanged the gun for\n a small syringe, which he pushed\n into a trouser pocket, and a single-edged\n razor blade.\n\n\n Removing his fiber-cloth jacket\n he slashed it into strips with the\n razor blade and flushed it down the\n disposal bowl. With the sleeves of\n his blouse rolled up he had the\n appearance of a typical workman\n as he strolled from the compartment.\n\n\n Back at the locker he replaced\n the briefcase and, with a wad of\n gum, glued the key to the bottom\n of the locker frame.\n\n\n One step more. Taking the syringe\n from his pocket, he plunged\n the needle into his forearm and\n tossed the instrument down a\n waste chute. He took three more\n steps and paused uncertainly.\n\n\n When he looked about him it\n was with the expression of a man\n waking from a vivid dream.\n\u201cQ\n UITE ingenious,\u201d Graves\n murmured admiringly. \u201cYou\n had your mind already preconditioned\n for the shot. But why would\n you deliberately give yourself amnesia?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat better disguise than to\n believe the part you\u2019re playing?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cA good man must have done\n that job on your mind,\u201d Bergstrom\n commented. \u201cI\u2019d have hesitated to\n try it myself. It must have taken a\n lot of trust on your part.\u201d\n\n\n [p\n 146\n ]\n\n \u201cTrust and money,\u201d Zarwell said\n drily.\n\n\n \u201cYour memory\u2019s back then?\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell nodded.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d Bergstrom\n assured him. \u201cNow that\n you\u2019re well again I\u2019d like to introduce\n you to a man named Vernon\n Johnson. This world\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell stopped him with an upraised\n hand. \u201cGood God, man, can\u2019t\n you see the reason for all this? I\u2019m\n tired. I\u2019m trying to quit.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cQuit?\u201d Bergstrom did not quite\n follow him.\n\n\n \u201cIt started on my home colony,\u201d\n Zarwell explained listlessly. \u201cA\n gang of hoods had taken over the\n government. I helped organize a\n movement to get them out. There\n was some bloodshed, but it went\n quite well. Several months later an\n unofficial envoy from another\n world asked several of us to give\n them a hand on the same kind of\n job. The political conditions there\n were rotten. We went with him.\n Again we were successful. It seems\n I have a kind of genius for that\n sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\n He stretched out his legs and regarded\n them thoughtfully. \u201cI\n learned then the truth of Russell\u2019s\n saying: \u2018When the oppressed win\n their freedom they are as oppressive\n as their former masters.\u2019 When\n they went bad, I opposed them.\n This time I failed. But I escaped\n again. I have quite a talent for that\n also.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m not a professional do-gooder.\u201d\n Zarwell\u2019s tone appealed\n to Bergstrom for understanding. \u201cI\n have only a normal man\u2019s indignation\n at injustice. And now I\u2019ve done\n my share. Yet, wherever I go, the\n word eventually gets out, and I\u2019m\n right back in a fight again. It\u2019s like\n the proverbial monkey on my back.\n I can\u2019t get rid of it.\u201d\n\n\n He rose. \u201cThat disguise and\n memory planting were supposed to\n get me out of it. I should have\n known it wouldn\u2019t work. But this\n time I\u2019m not going to be drawn\n back in! You and your Vernon\n Johnson can do your own revolting.\n I\u2019m through!\u201d\n\n\n Bergstrom did not argue as he\n left.\nRESTLESSNESS drove Zarwell\n from his flat the next day\u2014a\n legal holiday on St. Martin\u2019s. At\n a railed-off lot he stopped and loitered\n in the shadow of an adjacent\n building watching workmen drilling\n an excavation for a new structure.\n\n\n When a man strolled to his side\n and stood watching the workmen,\n he was not surprised. He waited for\n the other to speak.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you, if you\n can spare a few minutes,\u201d the\n stranger said.\n\n\n Zarwell turned and studied the\n man without answering. He was\n medium tall, with the body of an\n athlete, though perhaps ten years\n [p\n 147\n ]\n beyond the age of sports. He had\n a manner of contained energy.\n \u201cYou\u2019re Johnson?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n The man nodded.\n\n\n Zarwell tried to feel the anger he\n wanted to feel, but somehow it\n would not come. \u201cWe have nothing\n to talk about,\u201d was the best he\n could manage.\n\n\n \u201cThen will you just listen? After,\n I\u2019ll leave\u2014if you tell me to.\u201d\n\n\n Against his will he found himself\n liking the man, and wanting at least\n to be courteous. He inclined his\n head toward a curb wastebox with\n a flat top. \u201cShould we sit?\u201d\n\n\n Johnson smiled agreeably and\n they walked over to the box and\n sat down.\n\n\n \u201cWhen this colony was first\n founded,\u201d Johnson began without\n preamble, \u201cthe administrative body\n was a governor, and a council of\n twelve. Their successors were to\n be elected biennially. At first they\n were. Then things changed. We\n haven\u2019t had an election now in the\n last twenty-three years. St. Martin\u2019s\n is beginning to prosper. Yet\n the only ones receiving the benefits\n are the rulers. The citizens work\n twelve hours a day. They are poorly\n housed\n , poorly fed, poorly clothed.\n They\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell found himself not listening\n as Johnson\u2019s voice went on. The\n story was always the same. But why\n did they always try to drag him into\n their troubles?\n\n\n Why hadn\u2019t he chosen some\n other world on which to hide?\n\n\n The last question prompted a\n new thought. Just why had he\n chosen St. Martin\u2019s? Was it only a\n coincidence? Or had he,\n subconsciously\n at least, picked this particular\n world? He had always\n considered himself the unwilling\n subject of glib persuaders \u2026 but\n mightn\u2019t some inner compulsion of\n his own have put the monkey on his\n back?\n\n\n \u201c\u2026\u00a0and we need your help.\u201d\n Johnson had finished his speech.\n\n\n Zarwell gazed up at the bright\n sky. He pulled in a long breath,\n and let it out in a sigh.\n\n\n \u201cWhat are your plans so far?\u201d\n he asked wearily.\n\u2014\nCHARLES V. DE VET\n",

DE VET\nmonkey on his back\nUnder the cloud of cast-off identities\n  \n lay the shape of another man\u2014\n  \n was it himself?\nIllustrated by DILLON\nHE was walking endlessly\n down a long, glass-walled\n corridor. Bright sunlight\n slanted in through one wall, on the\n blue knapsack across his shoulders.\n Who he was, and what he was doing\n here, was clouded. The truth lurked\n in some corner of his consciousness,\n but it was not reached by surface\n awareness.\n\n\n The corridor opened at last into\n a large high-domed room, much\n like a railway station or an air terminal.\n He walked straight ahead.\n\n\n At the sight of him a man leaning\n negligently against a stone pillar,\n to his right but within vision,\n straightened and barked an order\n to him, \u201cHalt!\u201d He lengthened his\n stride but gave no other sign.\n\n\n [p\n 136\n ]\n\n Two men hurried through a\n doorway of a small anteroom to his\n left, calling to him. He turned away\n and began to run.\n\n\n Shouts and the sound of charging\n feet came from behind him. He\n cut to the right, running toward the\n escalator to the second floor. Another\n pair of men were hurrying\n down, two steps at a stride. With\n no break in pace he veered into an\n opening beside the escalator.\n\n\n At the first turn he saw that the\n aisle merely circled the stairway,\n coming out into the depot again on\n the other side. It was a trap. He\n glanced quickly around him.\n\n\n At the rear of the space was a\n row of lockers for traveler use. He\n slipped a coin into a pay slot,\n opened the zipper on his bag and\n pulled out a flat briefcase. It took\n him only a few seconds to push the\n case into the compartment, lock it\n and slide the key along the floor\n beneath the locker.\n\n\n There was nothing to do after\n that\u2014except wait.\n\n\n The men pursuing him came\n hurtling around the turn in the\n aisle. He kicked his knapsack to\n one side, spreading his feet wide\n with an instinctive motion.\n\n\n Until that instant he had intended\n to fight. Now he swiftly\n reassessed the odds. There were\n five of them, he saw. He should be\n able to incapacitate two or three\n and break out. But the fact that\n they had been expecting him meant\n that others would very probably\n be waiting outside. His best course\n now was to sham ignorance. He\n relaxed.\n\n\n He offered no resistance as they\n reached him.\n\n\n They were not gentle men. A tall\n ruffian, copper-brown face damp\n with perspiration and body oil,\n grabbed him by the jacket and\n slammed him back against the\n lockers. As he shifted his weight\n to keep his footing someone drove\n a fist into his face. He started to\n raise his hands; and a hard flat\n object crashed against the side of\n his skull.\n\n\n The starch went out of his legs.\n\u201cD\n O you make anything out of\n it?\u201d the psychoanalyst Milton\n Bergstrom, asked.\n\n\n John Zarwell shook his head.\n \u201cDid I talk while I was under?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, yes. You were supposed to.\n That way I follow pretty well what\n you\u2019re reenacting.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHow does it tie in with what I\n told you before?\u201d\n\n\n Bergstrom\u2019s neat-boned, fair-skinned\n face betrayed no emotion\n other than an introspective stillness\n of his normally alert gaze. \u201cI see\n no connection,\u201d he decided, his\n words once again precise and meticulous.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough to\n go on. Do you feel able to try another\n comanalysis this afternoon\n yet?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d Zarwell\n [p\n 137\n ]\n opened the collar of his shirt. The\n day was hot, and the room had no\n air conditioning, still a rare luxury\n on St. Martin\u2019s. The office window\n was open, but it let in no freshness,\n only the mildly rank odor that pervaded\n all the planet\u2019s habitable\n area.\n\n\n \u201cGood.\u201d Bergstrom rose. \u201cThe\n serum is quite harmless, John.\u201d He\n maintained a professional diversionary\n chatter as he administered\n the drug. \u201cA scopolamine derivative\n that\u2019s been well tested.\u201d\n\n\n The floor beneath Zarwell\u2019s feet\n assumed abruptly the near transfluent\n consistency of a damp\n sponge. It rose in a foot-high wave\n and rolled gently toward the far\n wall.\n\n\n Bergstrom continued talking,\n with practiced urbanity. \u201cWhen\n psychiatry was a less exact science,\u201d\n his voice went on, seeming to come\n from a great distance, \u201ca doctor\n had to spend weeks, sometimes\n months or years interviewing a\n patient. If he was skilled enough,\n he could sort the relevancies from\n the vast amount of chaff. We are\n able now, with the help of the\n serum, to confine our discourses to\n matters cogent to the patient\u2019s\n trouble.\u201d\n\n\n The floor continued its transmutation,\n and Zarwell sank deep into\n viscous depths. \u201cLie back and relax.\n Don\u2019t\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\n\n The words tumbled down from\n above. They faded, were gone.\nZARWELL found himself\nstanding on a vast plain. There was\n no sky above, and no horizon in the\n distance. He was in a place without\n space or dimension. There was\n nothing here except himself\u2014and\n the gun that he held in his hand.\n\n\n A weapon beautiful in its efficient\n simplicity.\n\n\n He should know all about the\n instrument, its purpose and workings,\n but he could not bring his\n thoughts into rational focus. His\n forehead creased with his mental\n effort.\n\n\n Abruptly the unreality about\n him shifted perspective. He was\n approaching\u2014not walking, but\n merely shortening the space between\n them\u2014the man who held\n the gun. The man who was himself.\n The other \u201chimself\u201d drifted\n nearer also, as though drawn by a\n mutual attraction.\n\n\n The man with the gun raised his\n weapon and pressed the trigger.\n\n\n With the action the perspective\n shifted again. He was watching the\n face of the man he shot jerk and\n twitch, expand and contract. The\n face was unharmed, yet it was no\n longer the same. No longer his own\n features.\n\n\n The stranger face smiled approvingly\n at him.\n\u201cO\n DD,\u201d Bergstrom said.\nHe brought his hands up and joined\n the tips of his fingers against his\n chest. \u201cBut it\u2019s another piece in the\n [p\n 138\n ]\n jig-saw. In time it will fit into\n place.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt means no\n more to you than the first, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo,\u201d Zarwell answered.\n\n\n He was not a talking man, Bergstrom\n reflected. It was more than\n reticence, however. The man had\n a hard granite core, only partially\n concealed by his present perplexity.\n He was a man who could handle\n himself well in an emergency.\n\n\n Bergstrom shrugged, dismissing\n his strayed thoughts. \u201cI expected\n as much. A quite normal first phase\n of treatment.\u201d He straightened a\n paper on his desk. \u201cI think that will\n be enough for today. Twice in one\n sitting is about all we ever try.\n Otherwise some particular episode\n might cause undue mental stress,\n and set up a block.\u201d He glanced\n down at his appointment pad. \u201cTomorrow\n at two, then?\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell grunted acknowledgment\n and pushed himself to his\n feet, apparently unaware that his\n shirt clung damply to his body.\nTHE sun was still high when\n Zarwell left the analyst\u2019s office.\n The white marble of the city\u2019s\n buildings shimmered in the afternoon\n heat, squat and austere as\n giant tree trunks, pock-marked and\n gray-mottled with windows. Zarwell\n was careful not to rest his hand\n on the flesh searing surface of the\n stone.\n\n\n The evening meal hour was approaching\n when he reached the\n Flats, on the way to his apartment.\n The streets of the old section were\n near-deserted. The only sounds he\n heard as he passed were the occasional\n cry of a baby, chronically\n uncomfortable in the day\u2019s heat,\n and the lowing of imported cattle\n waiting in a nearby shed to be\n shipped to the country.\n\n\n All St. Martin\u2019s has a distinctive\n smell, as of an arid dried-out\n swamp, with a faint taint of fish.\n But in the Flats the odor changes.\n Here is the smell of factories, warehouses,\n and trading marts; the smell\n of stale cooking drifting from the\n homes of the laborers and lower\n class techmen who live there.\n\n\n Zarwell passed a group of\n smaller children playing a desultory\n game of lic-lic for pieces of\n candy and cigarettes. Slowly he\n climbed the stairs of a stone flat.\n He prepared a supper for himself\n and ate it without either enjoyment\n or distaste. He lay down, fully\n clothed, on his bed. The visit to the\n analyst had done nothing to dispel\n his ennui.\n[p\n 139\n ]\n\n\n\n The next morning when Zarwell\n awoke he lay for a moment, unmoving.\n The feeling was there\n again, like a scene waiting only to\n be gazed at directly to be perceived.\n It was as though a great wisdom\n lay at the edge of understanding.\n If he rested quietly it would\n all come to him. Yet always, when\n his mind lost its sleep-induced\n [p\n 140\n ]\n lethargy, the moment of near understanding\n slipped away.\n\n\n This morning, however, the sense\n of disorientation did not pass with\n full wakefulness. He achieved no\n understanding, but the strangeness\n did not leave as he sat up.\n\n\n He gazed about him. The room\n did not seem to be his own. The\n furnishings, and the clothing he observed\n in a closet, might have belonged\n to a stranger.\n\n\n He pulled himself from his blankets,\n his body moving with mechanical\n reaction. The slippers into\n which he put his feet were larger\n than he had expected them to be.\n He walked about the small apartment.\n The place was familiar, but\n only as it would have been if he\n had studied it from blueprints, not\n as though he lived there.\n\n\n The feeling was still with him\n when he returned to the psychoanalyst.\nTHE scene this time was more\n kaleidoscopic, less personal.\n\n\n A village was being ravaged.\n Men struggled and died in the\n streets. Zarwell moved among\n them, seldom taking part in the\n individual clashes, yet a moving\n force in the\n conflict\n .\n\n\n The background changed. He\n understood that he was on a different\n world.\n\n\n Here a city burned. Its resistance\n was nearing its end. Zarwell was\n riding a shaggy pony outside a high\n wall surrounding the stricken metropolis.\n He moved in and joined a\n party of short, bearded men, directing\n them as they battered at the\n wall with a huge log mounted on a\n many-wheeled truck.\n\n\n The log broke a breach in the\n concrete and the besiegers charged\n through, carrying back the defenders\n who sought vainly to plug the\n gap. Soon there would be rioting\n in the streets again, plundering and\n killing.\n\n\n Zarwell was not the leader of the\n invaders, only a lesser figure in the\n rebellion. But he had played a leading\n part in the planning of the\n strategy that led to the city\u2019s fall.\n The job had been well done.\n\n\n Time passed, without visible\n break in the panorama. Now Zarwell\n was fleeing, pursued by the\n same bearded men who had been\n his comrades before. Still he moved\n with the same firm purpose, vigilant,\n resourceful, and well prepared\n for the eventuality that had befallen.\n He made his escape without\n difficulty.\n\n\n He alighted from a space ship on\n still another world\u2014another shift\n in time\u2014and the atmosphere of\n conflict engulfed him.\n\n\n Weary but resigned he accepted\n it, and did what he had to do\u00a0\u2026\nBERGSTROM was regarding\nhim with speculative scrutiny.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve had quite a past, apparently,\u201d\n he observed.\n\n\n [p\n 141\n ]\n\n Zarwell smiled with mild embarrassment.\n \u201cAt least in my dreams.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cDreams?\u201d Bergstrom\u2019s eyes\n widened in surprise. \u201cOh, I beg your\n pardon. I must have forgotten to\n explain. This work is so routine to\n me that sometimes I forget it\u2019s all\n new to a patient. Actually what you\n experienced under the drug were\n not dreams. They were recollections\n of real episodes from your\n past.\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell\u2019s expression became\n wary. He watched Bergstrom\n closely. After a minute, however,\n he seemed satisfied, and he let himself\n settle back against the cushion\n of his chair. \u201cI remember nothing\n of what I saw,\u201d he observed.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here, you\n know,\u201d Bergstrom answered. \u201cTo\n help you remember.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut everything under the drug\n is so\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHaphazard? That\u2019s true. The\n recall episodes are always purely\n random, with no chronological sequence.\n Our problem will be to reassemble\n them in proper order\n later. Or some particular scene may\n trigger a complete memory return.\n\n\n \u201cIt is my considered opinion,\u201d\n Bergstrom went on, \u201cthat your lost\n memory will turn out to be no ordinary\n amnesia. I believe we will find\n that your mind has been tampered\n with.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNothing I\u2019ve seen under the\n drug fits into the past I do remember.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s what makes me so certain,\u201d\n Bergstrom said confidently.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t remember what we\n have shown to be true. Conversely\n then, what you think you remember\n must be false. It must have been\n implanted there. But we can go\n into that later. For today I think\n we have done enough. This episode\n was quite prolonged.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI won\u2019t have any time off again\n until next week end,\u201d Zarwell reminded\n him.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Bergstrom\n thought for a moment. \u201cWe\n shouldn\u2019t let this hang too long.\n Could you come here after work\n tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI suppose I could.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cFine,\u201d Bergstrom said with satisfaction.\n \u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m considerably\n more than casually interested\n in your case by this time.\u201d\nA WORK truck picked Zarwell\n up the next morning and he\n rode with a tech crew to the edge of\n the reclam area. Beside the belt\n bringing ocean muck from the converter\n plant at the seashore his\n bulldozer was waiting.\n\n\n He took his place behind the\n drive wheel and began working dirt\n down between windbreakers anchored\n in the rock. Along a makeshift\n road into the badlands trucks\n brought crushed lime and phosphorus\n to supplement the ocean\n sediment. The progress of life from\n the sea to the land was a mechanical\n [p\n 142\n ]\n process of this growing world.\n\n\n Nearly two hundred years ago,\n when Earth established a colony on\n St. Martin\u2019s, the land surface of the\n planet had been barren. Only its\n seas thrived with animal and vegetable\n life. The necessary machinery\n and technicians had been supplied\n by Earth, and the long struggle began\n to fit the world for human\n needs. When Zarwell arrived, six\n months before, the vitalized area\n already extended three hundred\n miles along the coast, and sixty\n miles inland. And every day the\n progress continued. A large percentage\n of the energy and resources\n of the world were devoted to that\n essential expansion.\n\n\n The reclam crews filled and\n sodded the sterile rock, planted\n binding grasses, grain and trees, and\n diverted rivers to keep it fertile.\n When there were no rivers to divert\n they blasted out springs and lakes\n in the foothills to make their own.\n Biologists developed the necessary\n germ and insect life from what they\n found in the sea. Where that failed,\n they imported microorganisms\n from Earth.\n\n\n Three rubber-tracked crawlers\n picked their way down from the\n mountains until they joined the\n road passing the belt. They were\n loaded with ore that would be\n smelted into metal for depleted\n Earth, or for other colonies short\n of minerals. It was St. Martin\u2019s only\n export thus far.\n\n\n Zarwell pulled his sun helmet\n lower, to better guard his hot, dry\n features. The wind blew continuously\n on St. Martin\u2019s, but it furnished\n small relief from the heat.\n After its three-thousand-mile journey\n across scorched sterile rock, it\n sucked the moisture from a man\u2019s\n body, bringing a membrane-shrinking\n dryness to the nostrils as it was\n breathed in. With it came also the\n cloying taste of limestone in a\n worker\u2019s mouth.\n\n\n Zarwell gazed idly about at the\n other laborers. Fully three-quarters\n of them were beri-rabza ridden. A\n cure for the skin fungus had not\n yet been found; the men\u2019s faces\n and hands were scabbed and red.\n The colony had grown to near self-sufficiency,\n would soon have a moderate\n prosperity, yet they still\n lacked adequate medical and research\n facilities.\n\n\n Not all the world\u2019s citizens were\n content.\n\n\n Bergstrom was waiting in his office\n when Zarwell arrived that\n evening.\nHE was lying motionless on a\n hard cot, with his eyes closed,\n yet with his every sense sharply\n quickened. Tentatively he tightened\n small muscles in his arms and\n legs. Across his wrists and thighs\n he felt straps binding him to the\n cot.\n\n\n \u201cSo that\u2019s our big, bad man,\u201d a\n coarse voice above him observed\n [p\n 143\n ]\n caustically. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look so\n tough now, does he?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt might have been better to\n kill him right away,\u201d a second, less\n confident voice said. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed\n to be impossible to hold him.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. We just do\n what we\u2019re told. We\u2019ll hold him.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat do you think they\u2019ll do\n with him?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cExecute him, I suppose,\u201d the\n harsh voice said matter-of-factly.\n \u201cThey\u2019re probably just curious to\n see what he looks like first. They\u2019ll\n be disappointed.\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell opened his eyes a slit to\n observe his surroundings.\n\n\n It was a mistake. \u201cHe\u2019s out of\n it,\u201d the first speaker said, and Zarwell\n allowed his eyes to open fully.\n\n\n The voice, he saw, belonged to\n the big man who had bruised him\n against the locker at the spaceport.\n Irrelevantly he wondered how he\n knew now that it had been a spaceport.\n\n\n His captor\u2019s broad face jeered\n down at Zarwell. \u201cHave a good\n sleep?\u201d he asked with mock solicitude.\n Zarwell did not deign to acknowledge\n that he heard.\n\n\n The big man turned. \u201cYou can\n tell the Chief he\u2019s awake,\u201d he said.\n Zarwell followed his gaze to where\n a younger man, with a blond lock of\n hair on his forehead, stood behind\n him. The youth nodded and went\n out, while the other pulled a chair\n up to the side of Zarwell\u2019s cot.\n\n\n While their attention was away\n from him Zarwell had unobtrusively\n loosened his bonds as much as\n possible with arm leverage. As the\n big man drew his chair nearer, he\n made the hand farthest from him\n tight and compact and worked it\n free of the leather loop. He waited.\n\n\n The big man belched. \u201cYou\u2019re\n supposed to be great stuff in a situation\n like this,\u201d he said, his smoke-tan\n face splitting in a grin that revealed\n large square teeth. \u201cHow\n about giving me a sample?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou\u2019re a yellow-livered bastard,\u201d\n Zarwell told him.\n\n\n The grin faded from the oily face\n as the man stood up. He leaned over\n the cot\u2014and Zarwell\u2019s left hand\n shot up and locked about his throat,\n joined almost immediately by the\n right.\n\n\n The man\u2019s mouth opened and he\n tried to yell as he threw himself\n frantically backward. He clawed at\n the hands about his neck. When\n that failed to break the grip he suddenly\n reversed his weight and\n drove his fist at Zarwell\u2019s head.\n\n\n Zarwell pulled the struggling\n body down against his chest and\n held it there until all agitated\n movement ceased. He sat up then,\n letting the body slide to the floor.\n\n\n The straps about his thighs came\n loose with little effort.\nTHE analyst dabbed at his upper\n lip with a handkerchief. \u201cThe\n episodes are beginning to tie together,\u201d\n he said, with an attempt at\n [p\n 144\n ]\n nonchalance. \u201cThe next couple\n should do it.\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell did not answer. His\n memory seemed on the point of\n complete return, and he sat quietly,\n hopefully. However, nothing more\n came and he returned his attention\n to his more immediate problem.\n\n\n Opening a button on his shirt, he\n pulled back a strip of plastic cloth\n just below his rib cage and took\n out a small flat pistol. He held it\n in the palm of his hand. He knew\n now why he always carried it.\n\n\n Bergstrom had his bad moment.\n \u201cYou\u2019re not going to\u00a0\u2026\u201d he began\n at the sight of the gun. He tried\n again. \u201cYou must be joking.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI have very little sense of humor,\u201d\n Zarwell corrected him.\n\n\n \u201cYou\u2019d be foolish!\u201d\n\n\n Bergstrom obviously realized\n how close he was to death. Yet\n surprisingly, after the first start,\n he showed little fear. Zarwell had\n thought the man a bit soft, too\n adjusted to a life of ease and some\n prestige to meet danger calmly.\n Curiosity restrained his trigger finger.\n\n\n \u201cWhy would I be foolish?\u201d he\n asked. \u201cYour Meninger oath of inviolable\n confidence?\u201d\n\n\n Bergstrom shook his head. \u201cI\n know it\u2019s been broken before. But\n you need me. You\u2019re not through,\n you know. If you killed me you\u2019d\n still have to trust some other\n analyst.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIs that the best you can do?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo.\u201d Bergstrom was angry now.\n \u201cBut use that logical mind you\u2019re\n supposed to have! Scenes before\n this have shown what kind of man\n you are. Just because this last happened\n here on St. Martin\u2019s makes\n little difference. If I was going to\n turn you in to the police, I\u2019d have\n done it before this.\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell debated with himself the\n truth of what the other had said.\n \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you turn me in?\u201d he\n asked.\n\n\n \u201cBecause you\u2019re no mad-dog\n killer!\u201d Now that the crisis seemed\n to be past, Bergstrom spoke more\n calmly, even allowed himself to\n relax. \u201cYou\u2019re still pretty much in\n the fog about yourself. I read more\n in those comanalyses than you did.\n I even know who you are!\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell\u2019s eyebrows raised.\n\n\n \u201cWho am I?\u201d he asked, very interested\n now. Without attention he\n put his pistol away in a trouser\n pocket.\n\n\n Bergstrom brushed the question\n aside with one hand. \u201cYour name\n makes little difference. You\u2019ve used\n many. But you are an idealist. Your\n killings were necessary to bring\n justice to the places you visited. By\n now you\u2019re almost a legend among\n the human worlds. I\u2019d like to talk\n more with you on that later.\u201d\n\n\n While Zarwell considered, Bergstrom\n pressed his advantage. \u201cOne\n more scene might do it,\u201d he said.\n \u201cShould we try again\u2014if you trust\n me, that is?\u201d\n\n\n [p\n 145\n ]\n\n Zarwell made his decision quickly.\n \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he answered.\nALL Zarwell\u2019s attention seemed\n on the cigar he lit as he rode\n down the escalator, but he surveyed\n the terminal carefully over the rim\n of his hand. He spied no suspicious\n loungers.\n\n\n Behind the escalator he groped\n along the floor beneath the lockers\n until he found his key. The briefcase\n was under his arm a minute\n later.\n\n\n In the basement lave he put a\n coin in the pay slot of a private\n compartment and went in.\n\n\n As he zipped open the briefcase\n he surveyed his features in the mirror.\n A small muscle at the corner of\n one eye twitched spasmodically.\n One cheek wore a frozen quarter\n smile. Thirty-six hours under the\n paralysis was longer than advisable.\n The muscles should be rested at\n least every twenty hours.\n\n\n Fortunately his natural features\n would serve as an adequate disguise\n now.\n\n\n He adjusted the ring setting on\n the pistol-shaped instrument that\n he took from his case, and carefully\n rayed several small areas of\n his face, loosening muscles that had\n been tight too long. He sighed\n gratefully when he finished, massaging\n his cheeks and forehead with\n considerable pleasure. Another\n glance in the mirror satisfied him\n with the changes that had been\n made. He turned to his briefcase\n again and exchanged the gun for\n a small syringe, which he pushed\n into a trouser pocket, and a single-edged\n razor blade.\n\n\n Removing his fiber-cloth jacket\n he slashed it into strips with the\n razor blade and flushed it down the\n disposal bowl. With the sleeves of\n his blouse rolled up he had the\n appearance of a typical workman\n as he strolled from the compartment.\n\n\n Back at the locker he replaced\n the briefcase and, with a wad of\n gum, glued the key to the bottom\n of the locker frame.\n\n\n One step more. Taking the syringe\n from his pocket, he plunged\n the needle into his forearm and\n tossed the instrument down a\n waste chute. He took three more\n steps and paused uncertainly.\n\n\n When he looked about him it\n was with the expression of a man\n waking from a vivid dream.\n\u201cQ\n UITE ingenious,\u201d Graves\n murmured admiringly. \u201cYou\n had your mind already preconditioned\n for the shot. But why would\n you deliberately give yourself amnesia?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat better disguise than to\n believe the part you\u2019re playing?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cA good man must have done\n that job on your mind,\u201d Bergstrom\n commented. \u201cI\u2019d have hesitated to\n try it myself. It must have taken a\n lot of trust on your part.\u201d\n\n\n [p\n 146\n ]\n\n \u201cTrust and money,\u201d Zarwell said\n drily.\n\n\n \u201cYour memory\u2019s back then?\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell nodded.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d Bergstrom\n assured him. \u201cNow that\n you\u2019re well again I\u2019d like to introduce\n you to a man named Vernon\n Johnson. This world\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell stopped him with an upraised\n hand. \u201cGood God, man, can\u2019t\n you see the reason for all this? I\u2019m\n tired. I\u2019m trying to quit.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cQuit?\u201d Bergstrom did not quite\n follow him.\n\n\n \u201cIt started on my home colony,\u201d\n Zarwell explained listlessly. \u201cA\n gang of hoods had taken over the\n government. I helped organize a\n movement to get them out. There\n was some bloodshed, but it went\n quite well. Several months later an\n unofficial envoy from another\n world asked several of us to give\n them a hand on the same kind of\n job. The political conditions there\n were rotten. We went with him.\n Again we were successful. It seems\n I have a kind of genius for that\n sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\n He stretched out his legs and regarded\n them thoughtfully. \u201cI\n learned then the truth of Russell\u2019s\n saying: \u2018When the oppressed win\n their freedom they are as oppressive\n as their former masters.\u2019 When\n they went bad, I opposed them.\n This time I failed. But I escaped\n again. I have quite a talent for that\n also.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m not a professional do-gooder.\u201d\n Zarwell\u2019s tone appealed\n to Bergstrom for understanding. \u201cI\n have only a normal man\u2019s indignation\n at injustice. And now I\u2019ve done\n my share. Yet, wherever I go, the\n word eventually gets out, and I\u2019m\n right back in a fight again. It\u2019s like\n the proverbial monkey on my back.\n I can\u2019t get rid of it.\u201d\n\n\n He rose. \u201cThat disguise and\n memory planting were supposed to\n get me out of it. I should have\n known it wouldn\u2019t work. But this\n time I\u2019m not going to be drawn\n back in! You and your Vernon\n Johnson can do your own revolting.\n I\u2019m through!\u201d\n\n\n Bergstrom did not argue as he\n left.\nRESTLESSNESS drove Zarwell\n from his flat the next day\u2014a\n legal holiday on St. Martin\u2019s. At\n a railed-off lot he stopped and loitered\n in the shadow of an adjacent\n building watching workmen drilling\n an excavation for a new structure.\n\n\n When a man strolled to his side\n and stood watching the workmen,\n he was not surprised. He waited for\n the other to speak.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you, if you\n can spare a few minutes,\u201d the\n stranger said.\n\n\n Zarwell turned and studied the\n man without answering. He was\n medium tall, with the body of an\n athlete, though perhaps ten years\n [p\n 147\n ]\n beyond the age of sports. He had\n a manner of contained energy.\n \u201cYou\u2019re Johnson?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n The man nodded.\n\n\n Zarwell tried to feel the anger he\n wanted to feel, but somehow it\n would not come. \u201cWe have nothing\n to talk about,\u201d was the best he\n could manage.\n\n\n \u201cThen will you just listen? After,\n I\u2019ll leave\u2014if you tell me to.\u201d\n\n\n Against his will he found himself\n liking the man, and wanting at least\n to be courteous. He inclined his\n head toward a curb wastebox with\n a flat top. \u201cShould we sit?\u201d\n\n\n Johnson smiled agreeably and\n they walked over to the box and\n sat down.\n\n\n \u201cWhen this colony was first\n founded,\u201d Johnson began without\n preamble, \u201cthe administrative body\n was a governor, and a council of\n twelve. Their successors were to\n be elected biennially. At first they\n were. Then things changed. We\n haven\u2019t had an election now in the\n last twenty-three years. St. Martin\u2019s\n is beginning to prosper. Yet\n the only ones receiving the benefits\n are the rulers. The citizens work\n twelve hours a day. They are poorly\n housed\n , poorly fed, poorly clothed.\n They\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell found himself not listening\n as Johnson\u2019s voice went on. The\n story was always the same. But why\n did they always try to drag him into\n their troubles?\n\n\n Why hadn\u2019t he chosen some\n other world on which to hide?\n\n\n The last question prompted a\n new thought. Just why had he\n chosen St. Martin\u2019s? Was it only a\n coincidence? Or had he,\n subconsciously\n at least, picked this particular\n world? He had always\n considered himself the unwilling\n subject of glib persuaders \u2026 but\n mightn\u2019t some inner compulsion of\n his own have put the monkey on his\n back?\n\n\n \u201c\u2026\u00a0and we need your help.\u201d\n Johnson had finished his speech.\n\n\n Zarwell gazed up at the bright\n sky. He pulled in a long breath,\n and let it out in a sigh.\n\n\n \u201cWhat are your plans so far?\u201d\n he asked wearily.\n\u2014\nCHARLES V.

DE VET\nmonkey on his back\nUnder the cloud of cast-off identities\n  \n lay the shape of another man\u2014\n  \n was it himself?\nIllustrated by DILLON\nHE was walking endlessly\n down a long, glass-walled\n corridor. Bright sunlight\n slanted in through one wall, on the\n blue knapsack across his shoulders.\n Who he was, and what he was doing\n here, was clouded. The truth lurked\n in some corner of his consciousness,\n but it was not reached by surface\n awareness.\n\n\n The corridor opened at last into\n a large high-domed room, much\n like a railway station or an air terminal.\n He walked straight ahead.\n\n\n At the sight of him a man leaning\n negligently against a stone pillar,\n to his right but within vision,\n straightened and barked an order\n to him, \u201cHalt!\u201d He lengthened his\n stride but gave no other sign.\n\n\n [p\n 136\n ]\n\n Two men hurried through a\n doorway of a small anteroom to his\n left, calling to him. He turned away\n and began to run.\n\n\n Shouts and the sound of charging\n feet came from behind him. He\n cut to the right, running toward the\n escalator to the second floor. Another\n pair of men were hurrying\n down, two steps at a stride. With\n no break in pace he veered into an\n opening beside the escalator.\n\n\n At the first turn he saw that the\n aisle merely circled the stairway,\n coming out into the depot again on\n the other side. It was a trap. He\n glanced quickly around him.\n\n\n At the rear of the space was a\n row of lockers for traveler use. He\n slipped a coin into a pay slot,\n opened the zipper on his bag and\n pulled out a flat briefcase. It took\n him only a few seconds to push the\n case into the compartment, lock it\n and slide the key along the floor\n beneath the locker.\n\n\n There was nothing to do after\n that\u2014except wait.\n\n\n The men pursuing him came\n hurtling around the turn in the\n aisle. He kicked his knapsack to\n one side, spreading his feet wide\n with an instinctive motion.\n\n\n Until that instant he had intended\n to fight. Now he swiftly\n reassessed the odds. There were\n five of them, he saw. He should be\n able to incapacitate two or three\n and break out. But the fact that\n they had been expecting him meant\n that others would very probably\n be waiting outside. His best course\n now was to sham ignorance. He\n relaxed.\n\n\n He offered no resistance as they\n reached him.\n\n\n They were not gentle men. A tall\n ruffian, copper-brown face damp\n with perspiration and body oil,\n grabbed him by the jacket and\n slammed him back against the\n lockers. As he shifted his weight\n to keep his footing someone drove\n a fist into his face. He started to\n raise his hands; and a hard flat\n object crashed against the side of\n his skull.\n\n\n The starch went out of his legs.\n\u201cD\n O you make anything out of\n it?\u201d the psychoanalyst Milton\n Bergstrom, asked.\n\n\n John Zarwell shook his head.\n \u201cDid I talk while I was under?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, yes. You were supposed to.\n That way I follow pretty well what\n you\u2019re reenacting.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHow does it tie in with what I\n told you before?\u201d\n\n\n Bergstrom\u2019s neat-boned, fair-skinned\n face betrayed no emotion\n other than an introspective stillness\n of his normally alert gaze. \u201cI see\n no connection,\u201d he decided, his\n words once again precise and meticulous.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough to\n go on. Do you feel able to try another\n comanalysis this afternoon\n yet?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d Zarwell\n [p\n 137\n ]\n opened the collar of his shirt. The\n day was hot, and the room had no\n air conditioning, still a rare luxury\n on St. Martin\u2019s. The office window\n was open, but it let in no freshness,\n only the mildly rank odor that pervaded\n all the planet\u2019s habitable\n area.\n\n\n \u201cGood.\u201d Bergstrom rose. \u201cThe\n serum is quite harmless, John.\u201d He\n maintained a professional diversionary\n chatter as he administered\n the drug. \u201cA scopolamine derivative\n that\u2019s been well tested.\u201d\n\n\n The floor beneath Zarwell\u2019s feet\n assumed abruptly the near transfluent\n consistency of a damp\n sponge. It rose in a foot-high wave\n and rolled gently toward the far\n wall.\n\n\n Bergstrom continued talking,\n with practiced urbanity. \u201cWhen\n psychiatry was a less exact science,\u201d\n his voice went on, seeming to come\n from a great distance, \u201ca doctor\n had to spend weeks, sometimes\n months or years interviewing a\n patient. If he was skilled enough,\n he could sort the relevancies from\n the vast amount of chaff. We are\n able now, with the help of the\n serum, to confine our discourses to\n matters cogent to the patient\u2019s\n trouble.\u201d\n\n\n The floor continued its transmutation,\n and Zarwell sank deep into\n viscous depths. \u201cLie back and relax.\n Don\u2019t\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\n\n The words tumbled down from\n above. They faded, were gone.\nZARWELL found himself\nstanding on a vast plain. There was\n no sky above, and no horizon in the\n distance. He was in a place without\n space or dimension. There was\n nothing here except himself\u2014and\n the gun that he held in his hand.\n\n\n A weapon beautiful in its efficient\n simplicity.\n\n\n He should know all about the\n instrument, its purpose and workings,\n but he could not bring his\n thoughts into rational focus. His\n forehead creased with his mental\n effort.\n\n\n Abruptly the unreality about\n him shifted perspective. He was\n approaching\u2014not walking, but\n merely shortening the space between\n them\u2014the man who held\n the gun. The man who was himself.\n The other \u201chimself\u201d drifted\n nearer also, as though drawn by a\n mutual attraction.\n\n\n The man with the gun raised his\n weapon and pressed the trigger.\n\n\n With the action the perspective\n shifted again. He was watching the\n face of the man he shot jerk and\n twitch, expand and contract. The\n face was unharmed, yet it was no\n longer the same. No longer his own\n features.\n\n\n The stranger face smiled approvingly\n at him.\n\u201cO\n DD,\u201d Bergstrom said.\nHe brought his hands up and joined\n the tips of his fingers against his\n chest. \u201cBut it\u2019s another piece in the\n [p\n 138\n ]\n jig-saw. In time it will fit into\n place.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt means no\n more to you than the first, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo,\u201d Zarwell answered.\n\n\n He was not a talking man, Bergstrom\n reflected. It was more than\n reticence, however. The man had\n a hard granite core, only partially\n concealed by his present perplexity.\n He was a man who could handle\n himself well in an emergency.\n\n\n Bergstrom shrugged, dismissing\n his strayed thoughts. \u201cI expected\n as much. A quite normal first phase\n of treatment.\u201d He straightened a\n paper on his desk. \u201cI think that will\n be enough for today. Twice in one\n sitting is about all we ever try.\n Otherwise some particular episode\n might cause undue mental stress,\n and set up a block.\u201d He glanced\n down at his appointment pad. \u201cTomorrow\n at two, then?\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell grunted acknowledgment\n and pushed himself to his\n feet, apparently unaware that his\n shirt clung damply to his body.\nTHE sun was still high when\n Zarwell left the analyst\u2019s office.\n The white marble of the city\u2019s\n buildings shimmered in the afternoon\n heat, squat and austere as\n giant tree trunks, pock-marked and\n gray-mottled with windows. Zarwell\n was careful not to rest his hand\n on the flesh searing surface of the\n stone.\n\n\n The evening meal hour was approaching\n when he reached the\n Flats, on the way to his apartment.\n The streets of the old section were\n near-deserted. The only sounds he\n heard as he passed were the occasional\n cry of a baby, chronically\n uncomfortable in the day\u2019s heat,\n and the lowing of imported cattle\n waiting in a nearby shed to be\n shipped to the country.\n\n\n All St. Martin\u2019s has a distinctive\n smell, as of an arid dried-out\n swamp, with a faint taint of fish.\n But in the Flats the odor changes.\n Here is the smell of factories, warehouses,\n and trading marts; the smell\n of stale cooking drifting from the\n homes of the laborers and lower\n class techmen who live there.\n\n\n Zarwell passed a group of\n smaller children playing a desultory\n game of lic-lic for pieces of\n candy and cigarettes. Slowly he\n climbed the stairs of a stone flat.\n He prepared a supper for himself\n and ate it without either enjoyment\n or distaste. He lay down, fully\n clothed, on his bed. The visit to the\n analyst had done nothing to dispel\n his ennui.\n[p\n 139\n ]\n\n\n\n The next morning when Zarwell\n awoke he lay for a moment, unmoving.\n The feeling was there\n again, like a scene waiting only to\n be gazed at directly to be perceived.\n It was as though a great wisdom\n lay at the edge of understanding.\n If he rested quietly it would\n all come to him. Yet always, when\n his mind lost its sleep-induced\n [p\n 140\n ]\n lethargy, the moment of near understanding\n slipped away.\n\n\n This morning, however, the sense\n of disorientation did not pass with\n full wakefulness. He achieved no\n understanding, but the strangeness\n did not leave as he sat up.\n\n\n He gazed about him. The room\n did not seem to be his own. The\n furnishings, and the clothing he observed\n in a closet, might have belonged\n to a stranger.\n\n\n He pulled himself from his blankets,\n his body moving with mechanical\n reaction. The slippers into\n which he put his feet were larger\n than he had expected them to be.\n He walked about the small apartment.\n The place was familiar, but\n only as it would have been if he\n had studied it from blueprints, not\n as though he lived there.\n\n\n The feeling was still with him\n when he returned to the psychoanalyst.\nTHE scene this time was more\n kaleidoscopic, less personal.\n\n\n A village was being ravaged.\n Men struggled and died in the\n streets. Zarwell moved among\n them, seldom taking part in the\n individual clashes, yet a moving\n force in the\n conflict\n .\n\n\n The background changed. He\n understood that he was on a different\n world.\n\n\n Here a city burned. Its resistance\n was nearing its end. Zarwell was\n riding a shaggy pony outside a high\n wall surrounding the stricken metropolis.\n He moved in and joined a\n party of short, bearded men, directing\n them as they battered at the\n wall with a huge log mounted on a\n many-wheeled truck.\n\n\n The log broke a breach in the\n concrete and the besiegers charged\n through, carrying back the defenders\n who sought vainly to plug the\n gap. Soon there would be rioting\n in the streets again, plundering and\n killing.\n\n\n Zarwell was not the leader of the\n invaders, only a lesser figure in the\n rebellion. But he had played a leading\n part in the planning of the\n strategy that led to the city\u2019s fall.\n The job had been well done.\n\n\n Time passed, without visible\n break in the panorama. Now Zarwell\n was fleeing, pursued by the\n same bearded men who had been\n his comrades before. Still he moved\n with the same firm purpose, vigilant,\n resourceful, and well prepared\n for the eventuality that had befallen.\n He made his escape without\n difficulty.\n\n\n He alighted from a space ship on\n still another world\u2014another shift\n in time\u2014and the atmosphere of\n conflict engulfed him.\n\n\n Weary but resigned he accepted\n it, and did what he had to do\u00a0\u2026\nBERGSTROM was regarding\nhim with speculative scrutiny.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve had quite a past, apparently,\u201d\n he observed.\n\n\n [p\n 141\n ]\n\n Zarwell smiled with mild embarrassment.\n \u201cAt least in my dreams.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cDreams?\u201d Bergstrom\u2019s eyes\n widened in surprise. \u201cOh, I beg your\n pardon. I must have forgotten to\n explain. This work is so routine to\n me that sometimes I forget it\u2019s all\n new to a patient. Actually what you\n experienced under the drug were\n not dreams. They were recollections\n of real episodes from your\n past.\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell\u2019s expression became\n wary. He watched Bergstrom\n closely. After a minute, however,\n he seemed satisfied, and he let himself\n settle back against the cushion\n of his chair. \u201cI remember nothing\n of what I saw,\u201d he observed.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here, you\n know,\u201d Bergstrom answered. \u201cTo\n help you remember.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut everything under the drug\n is so\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHaphazard? That\u2019s true. The\n recall episodes are always purely\n random, with no chronological sequence.\n Our problem will be to reassemble\n them in proper order\n later. Or some particular scene may\n trigger a complete memory return.\n\n\n \u201cIt is my considered opinion,\u201d\n Bergstrom went on, \u201cthat your lost\n memory will turn out to be no ordinary\n amnesia. I believe we will find\n that your mind has been tampered\n with.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNothing I\u2019ve seen under the\n drug fits into the past I do remember.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s what makes me so certain,\u201d\n Bergstrom said confidently.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t remember what we\n have shown to be true. Conversely\n then, what you think you remember\n must be false. It must have been\n implanted there. But we can go\n into that later. For today I think\n we have done enough. This episode\n was quite prolonged.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI won\u2019t have any time off again\n until next week end,\u201d Zarwell reminded\n him.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Bergstrom\n thought for a moment. \u201cWe\n shouldn\u2019t let this hang too long.\n Could you come here after work\n tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI suppose I could.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cFine,\u201d Bergstrom said with satisfaction.\n \u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m considerably\n more than casually interested\n in your case by this time.\u201d\nA WORK truck picked Zarwell\n up the next morning and he\n rode with a tech crew to the edge of\n the reclam area. Beside the belt\n bringing ocean muck from the converter\n plant at the seashore his\n bulldozer was waiting.\n\n\n He took his place behind the\n drive wheel and began working dirt\n down between windbreakers anchored\n in the rock. Along a makeshift\n road into the badlands trucks\n brought crushed lime and phosphorus\n to supplement the ocean\n sediment. The progress of life from\n the sea to the land was a mechanical\n [p\n 142\n ]\n process of this growing world.\n\n\n Nearly two hundred years ago,\n when Earth established a colony on\n St. Martin\u2019s, the land surface of the\n planet had been barren. Only its\n seas thrived with animal and vegetable\n life. The necessary machinery\n and technicians had been supplied\n by Earth, and the long struggle began\n to fit the world for human\n needs. When Zarwell arrived, six\n months before, the vitalized area\n already extended three hundred\n miles along the coast, and sixty\n miles inland. And every day the\n progress continued. A large percentage\n of the energy and resources\n of the world were devoted to that\n essential expansion.\n\n\n The reclam crews filled and\n sodded the sterile rock, planted\n binding grasses, grain and trees, and\n diverted rivers to keep it fertile.\n When there were no rivers to divert\n they blasted out springs and lakes\n in the foothills to make their own.\n Biologists developed the necessary\n germ and insect life from what they\n found in the sea. Where that failed,\n they imported microorganisms\n from Earth.\n\n\n Three rubber-tracked crawlers\n picked their way down from the\n mountains until they joined the\n road passing the belt. They were\n loaded with ore that would be\n smelted into metal for depleted\n Earth, or for other colonies short\n of minerals. It was St. Martin\u2019s only\n export thus far.\n\n\n Zarwell pulled his sun helmet\n lower, to better guard his hot, dry\n features. The wind blew continuously\n on St. Martin\u2019s, but it furnished\n small relief from the heat.\n After its three-thousand-mile journey\n across scorched sterile rock, it\n sucked the moisture from a man\u2019s\n body, bringing a membrane-shrinking\n dryness to the nostrils as it was\n breathed in. With it came also the\n cloying taste of limestone in a\n worker\u2019s mouth.\n\n\n Zarwell gazed idly about at the\n other laborers. Fully three-quarters\n of them were beri-rabza ridden. A\n cure for the skin fungus had not\n yet been found; the men\u2019s faces\n and hands were scabbed and red.\n The colony had grown to near self-sufficiency,\n would soon have a moderate\n prosperity, yet they still\n lacked adequate medical and research\n facilities.\n\n\n Not all the world\u2019s citizens were\n content.\n\n\n Bergstrom was waiting in his office\n when Zarwell arrived that\n evening.\nHE was lying motionless on a\n hard cot, with his eyes closed,\n yet with his every sense sharply\n quickened. Tentatively he tightened\n small muscles in his arms and\n legs. Across his wrists and thighs\n he felt straps binding him to the\n cot.\n\n\n \u201cSo that\u2019s our big, bad man,\u201d a\n coarse voice above him observed\n [p\n 143\n ]\n caustically. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look so\n tough now, does he?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt might have been better to\n kill him right away,\u201d a second, less\n confident voice said. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed\n to be impossible to hold him.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. We just do\n what we\u2019re told. We\u2019ll hold him.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat do you think they\u2019ll do\n with him?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cExecute him, I suppose,\u201d the\n harsh voice said matter-of-factly.\n \u201cThey\u2019re probably just curious to\n see what he looks like first. They\u2019ll\n be disappointed.\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell opened his eyes a slit to\n observe his surroundings.\n\n\n It was a mistake. \u201cHe\u2019s out of\n it,\u201d the first speaker said, and Zarwell\n allowed his eyes to open fully.\n\n\n The voice, he saw, belonged to\n the big man who had bruised him\n against the locker at the spaceport.\n Irrelevantly he wondered how he\n knew now that it had been a spaceport.\n\n\n His captor\u2019s broad face jeered\n down at Zarwell. \u201cHave a good\n sleep?\u201d he asked with mock solicitude.\n Zarwell did not deign to acknowledge\n that he heard.\n\n\n The big man turned. \u201cYou can\n tell the Chief he\u2019s awake,\u201d he said.\n Zarwell followed his gaze to where\n a younger man, with a blond lock of\n hair on his forehead, stood behind\n him. The youth nodded and went\n out, while the other pulled a chair\n up to the side of Zarwell\u2019s cot.\n\n\n While their attention was away\n from him Zarwell had unobtrusively\n loosened his bonds as much as\n possible with arm leverage. As the\n big man drew his chair nearer, he\n made the hand farthest from him\n tight and compact and worked it\n free of the leather loop. He waited.\n\n\n The big man belched. \u201cYou\u2019re\n supposed to be great stuff in a situation\n like this,\u201d he said, his smoke-tan\n face splitting in a grin that revealed\n large square teeth. \u201cHow\n about giving me a sample?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou\u2019re a yellow-livered bastard,\u201d\n Zarwell told him.\n\n\n The grin faded from the oily face\n as the man stood up. He leaned over\n the cot\u2014and Zarwell\u2019s left hand\n shot up and locked about his throat,\n joined almost immediately by the\n right.\n\n\n The man\u2019s mouth opened and he\n tried to yell as he threw himself\n frantically backward. He clawed at\n the hands about his neck. When\n that failed to break the grip he suddenly\n reversed his weight and\n drove his fist at Zarwell\u2019s head.\n\n\n Zarwell pulled the struggling\n body down against his chest and\n held it there until all agitated\n movement ceased. He sat up then,\n letting the body slide to the floor.\n\n\n The straps about his thighs came\n loose with little effort.\nTHE analyst dabbed at his upper\n lip with a handkerchief. \u201cThe\n episodes are beginning to tie together,\u201d\n he said, with an attempt at\n [p\n 144\n ]\n nonchalance. \u201cThe next couple\n should do it.\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell did not answer. His\n memory seemed on the point of\n complete return, and he sat quietly,\n hopefully. However, nothing more\n came and he returned his attention\n to his more immediate problem.\n\n\n Opening a button on his shirt, he\n pulled back a strip of plastic cloth\n just below his rib cage and took\n out a small flat pistol. He held it\n in the palm of his hand. He knew\n now why he always carried it.\n\n\n Bergstrom had his bad moment.\n \u201cYou\u2019re not going to\u00a0\u2026\u201d he began\n at the sight of the gun. He tried\n again. \u201cYou must be joking.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI have very little sense of humor,\u201d\n Zarwell corrected him.\n\n\n \u201cYou\u2019d be foolish!\u201d\n\n\n Bergstrom obviously realized\n how close he was to death. Yet\n surprisingly, after the first start,\n he showed little fear. Zarwell had\n thought the man a bit soft, too\n adjusted to a life of ease and some\n prestige to meet danger calmly.\n Curiosity restrained his trigger finger.\n\n\n \u201cWhy would I be foolish?\u201d he\n asked. \u201cYour Meninger oath of inviolable\n confidence?\u201d\n\n\n Bergstrom shook his head. \u201cI\n know it\u2019s been broken before. But\n you need me. You\u2019re not through,\n you know. If you killed me you\u2019d\n still have to trust some other\n analyst.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIs that the best you can do?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo.\u201d Bergstrom was angry now.\n \u201cBut use that logical mind you\u2019re\n supposed to have! Scenes before\n this have shown what kind of man\n you are. Just because this last happened\n here on St. Martin\u2019s makes\n little difference. If I was going to\n turn you in to the police, I\u2019d have\n done it before this.\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell debated with himself the\n truth of what the other had said.\n \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you turn me in?\u201d he\n asked.\n\n\n \u201cBecause you\u2019re no mad-dog\n killer!\u201d Now that the crisis seemed\n to be past, Bergstrom spoke more\n calmly, even allowed himself to\n relax. \u201cYou\u2019re still pretty much in\n the fog about yourself. I read more\n in those comanalyses than you did.\n I even know who you are!\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell\u2019s eyebrows raised.\n\n\n \u201cWho am I?\u201d he asked, very interested\n now. Without attention he\n put his pistol away in a trouser\n pocket.\n\n\n Bergstrom brushed the question\n aside with one hand. \u201cYour name\n makes little difference. You\u2019ve used\n many. But you are an idealist. Your\n killings were necessary to bring\n justice to the places you visited. By\n now you\u2019re almost a legend among\n the human worlds. I\u2019d like to talk\n more with you on that later.\u201d\n\n\n While Zarwell considered, Bergstrom\n pressed his advantage. \u201cOne\n more scene might do it,\u201d he said.\n \u201cShould we try again\u2014if you trust\n me, that is?\u201d\n\n\n [p\n 145\n ]\n\n Zarwell made his decision quickly.\n \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he answered.\nALL Zarwell\u2019s attention seemed\n on the cigar he lit as he rode\n down the escalator, but he surveyed\n the terminal carefully over the rim\n of his hand. He spied no suspicious\n loungers.\n\n\n Behind the escalator he groped\n along the floor beneath the lockers\n until he found his key. The briefcase\n was under his arm a minute\n later.\n\n\n In the basement lave he put a\n coin in the pay slot of a private\n compartment and went in.\n\n\n As he zipped open the briefcase\n he surveyed his features in the mirror.\n A small muscle at the corner of\n one eye twitched spasmodically.\n One cheek wore a frozen quarter\n smile. Thirty-six hours under the\n paralysis was longer than advisable.\n The muscles should be rested at\n least every twenty hours.\n\n\n Fortunately his natural features\n would serve as an adequate disguise\n now.\n\n\n He adjusted the ring setting on\n the pistol-shaped instrument that\n he took from his case, and carefully\n rayed several small areas of\n his face, loosening muscles that had\n been tight too long. He sighed\n gratefully when he finished, massaging\n his cheeks and forehead with\n considerable pleasure. Another\n glance in the mirror satisfied him\n with the changes that had been\n made. He turned to his briefcase\n again and exchanged the gun for\n a small syringe, which he pushed\n into a trouser pocket, and a single-edged\n razor blade.\n\n\n Removing his fiber-cloth jacket\n he slashed it into strips with the\n razor blade and flushed it down the\n disposal bowl. With the sleeves of\n his blouse rolled up he had the\n appearance of a typical workman\n as he strolled from the compartment.\n\n\n Back at the locker he replaced\n the briefcase and, with a wad of\n gum, glued the key to the bottom\n of the locker frame.\n\n\n One step more. Taking the syringe\n from his pocket, he plunged\n the needle into his forearm and\n tossed the instrument down a\n waste chute. He took three more\n steps and paused uncertainly.\n\n\n When he looked about him it\n was with the expression of a man\n waking from a vivid dream.\n\u201cQ\n UITE ingenious,\u201d Graves\n murmured admiringly. \u201cYou\n had your mind already preconditioned\n for the shot. But why would\n you deliberately give yourself amnesia?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat better disguise than to\n believe the part you\u2019re playing?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cA good man must have done\n that job on your mind,\u201d Bergstrom\n commented. \u201cI\u2019d have hesitated to\n try it myself. It must have taken a\n lot of trust on your part.\u201d\n\n\n [p\n 146\n ]\n\n \u201cTrust and money,\u201d Zarwell said\n drily.\n\n\n \u201cYour memory\u2019s back then?\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell nodded.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d Bergstrom\n assured him. \u201cNow that\n you\u2019re well again I\u2019d like to introduce\n you to a man named Vernon\n Johnson. This world\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell stopped him with an upraised\n hand. \u201cGood God, man, can\u2019t\n you see the reason for all this? I\u2019m\n tired. I\u2019m trying to quit.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cQuit?\u201d Bergstrom did not quite\n follow him.\n\n\n \u201cIt started on my home colony,\u201d\n Zarwell explained listlessly. \u201cA\n gang of hoods had taken over the\n government. I helped organize a\n movement to get them out. There\n was some bloodshed, but it went\n quite well. Several months later an\n unofficial envoy from another\n world asked several of us to give\n them a hand on the same kind of\n job. The political conditions there\n were rotten. We went with him.\n Again we were successful. It seems\n I have a kind of genius for that\n sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\n He stretched out his legs and regarded\n them thoughtfully. \u201cI\n learned then the truth of Russell\u2019s\n saying: \u2018When the oppressed win\n their freedom they are as oppressive\n as their former masters.\u2019 When\n they went bad, I opposed them.\n This time I failed. But I escaped\n again. I have quite a talent for that\n also.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m not a professional do-gooder.\u201d\n Zarwell\u2019s tone appealed\n to Bergstrom for understanding. \u201cI\n have only a normal man\u2019s indignation\n at injustice. And now I\u2019ve done\n my share. Yet, wherever I go, the\n word eventually gets out, and I\u2019m\n right back in a fight again. It\u2019s like\n the proverbial monkey on my back.\n I can\u2019t get rid of it.\u201d\n\n\n He rose. \u201cThat disguise and\n memory planting were supposed to\n get me out of it. I should have\n known it wouldn\u2019t work. But this\n time I\u2019m not going to be drawn\n back in! You and your Vernon\n Johnson can do your own revolting.\n I\u2019m through!\u201d\n\n\n Bergstrom did not argue as he\n left.\nRESTLESSNESS drove Zarwell\n from his flat the next day\u2014a\n legal holiday on St. Martin\u2019s. At\n a railed-off lot he stopped and loitered\n in the shadow of an adjacent\n building watching workmen drilling\n an excavation for a new structure.\n\n\n When a man strolled to his side\n and stood watching the workmen,\n he was not surprised. He waited for\n the other to speak.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you, if you\n can spare a few minutes,\u201d the\n stranger said.\n\n\n Zarwell turned and studied the\n man without answering. He was\n medium tall, with the body of an\n athlete, though perhaps ten years\n [p\n 147\n ]\n beyond the age of sports. He had\n a manner of contained energy.\n \u201cYou\u2019re Johnson?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n The man nodded.\n\n\n Zarwell tried to feel the anger he\n wanted to feel, but somehow it\n would not come. \u201cWe have nothing\n to talk about,\u201d was the best he\n could manage.\n\n\n \u201cThen will you just listen? After,\n I\u2019ll leave\u2014if you tell me to.\u201d\n\n\n Against his will he found himself\n liking the man, and wanting at least\n to be courteous. He inclined his\n head toward a curb wastebox with\n a flat top. \u201cShould we sit?\u201d\n\n\n Johnson smiled agreeably and\n they walked over to the box and\n sat down.\n\n\n \u201cWhen this colony was first\n founded,\u201d Johnson began without\n preamble, \u201cthe administrative body\n was a governor, and a council of\n twelve. Their successors were to\n be elected biennially. At first they\n were. Then things changed. We\n haven\u2019t had an election now in the\n last twenty-three years. St. Martin\u2019s\n is beginning to prosper. Yet\n the only ones receiving the benefits\n are the rulers. The citizens work\n twelve hours a day. They are poorly\n housed\n , poorly fed, poorly clothed.\n They\u00a0\u2026\u201d\n\n\n Zarwell found himself not listening\n as Johnson\u2019s voice went on. The\n story was always the same. But why\n did they always try to drag him into\n their troubles?\n\n\n Why hadn\u2019t he chosen some\n other world on which to hide?\n\n\n The last question prompted a\n new thought. Just why had he\n chosen St. Martin\u2019s? Was it only a\n coincidence? Or had he,\n subconsciously\n at least, picked this particular\n world? He had always\n considered himself the unwilling\n subject of glib persuaders \u2026 but\n mightn\u2019t some inner compulsion of\n his own have put the monkey on his\n back?\n\n\n \u201c\u2026\u00a0and we need your help.\u201d\n Johnson had finished his speech.\n\n\n Zarwell gazed up at the bright\n sky. He pulled in a long breath,\n and let it out in a sigh.\n\n\n \u201cWhat are your plans so far?\u201d\n he asked wearily.\n\u2014\nCHARLES V.
