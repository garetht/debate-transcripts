THE LITTLE RED BAG By JERRY SOHL [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, January 1960.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] About an hour out of San Francisco on the flight to Los Angeles, I made  the discovery. I had finished reading the Chronicle , folded and put  it beside me, turned and looked out the window, expecting to see the  San Joaquin Valley but finding only a sea of clouds instead. So I  returned my attention to the inside of the plane, to the overstuffed  gray-haired woman asleep beside me, to the backs of heads in seats  before me, across the aisle to other heads, and down to the blonde.\n\n\n I had seen her in the concourse and at the gate, a shapely thing. Now  she had crossed her legs and I was privileged to view a trim ankle and  calf, and her profile as she stared moodily across the aisle and out a  window where there was nothing to see.\n\n\n I slid my eyes past her to others. A crossword-puzzle worker, a  togetherness-type-magazine reader.\n\n\n Inventory completed, I went back to looking at the clouds, knowing I  should be thinking about the printing order I was going to Los Angeles  for, and not wanting to.\n\n\n So I started going through the purse of the woman next to me. Perhaps  that sounds bad. It wasn't. I'd been doing it for years and nobody ever  complained.\n\n\n It started when I was a kid, this business of being able to explore  the insides of things like purses and sealed boxes and locked drawers  and\u2014well, human beings. But human beings aren't worth the trouble.  It's like swimming through spaghetti. And I've got to stay away from  electric wires. They hurt. Now don't ask me how they hurt.\n\n\n Maybe you think it's fun. For the most part, it really isn't. I always  knew what was in Christmas presents before I unwrapped them, and  therefore Christmas was always spoiled for me as a kid. I can't feel  the color of anything, just its consistency. An apple senses about the  same as a potato, except for the core and the stem. I can't even tell  if there's writing on a piece of paper. So you see it isn't much. Just  the feel of shapes, the hardnesses and softnesses. But I've learned to  become pretty good at guessing.\n\n\n Like this woman next to me. She had a short, cylindrical metal object  in her purse with waxlike stuff inside it\u2014a lipstick. A round, hard  object with dust inside\u2014a compact. Handkerchief, chewing gum, a small  book, probably an address book, money in a change purse\u2014a few bills  and coins. Not much else.\n\n\n I was a little disappointed. I've run across a gun or two in my time.  But I never say anything. I learned the wisdom of keeping my mouth shut in the fourth grade when  Miss Winters, a stern, white-haired disciplinarian, ordered me to eat  my sack lunch in the classroom with her instead of outside with some  of the other kids. This was the punishment for some minor infraction.  Lunchtime was nearly over and we'd both finished eating; she said she'd  be gone for a few moments and that I was to erase the blackboard during  her absence, which I dutifully did.\n\n\n Class had hardly resumed when she started looking around the desk for  her favorite mechanical pencil, asking if any of us had seen it, and  looking straight at me. I didn't want her to think I had taken it while  she was out of the room, so I probed the contents of her purse, which  she always kept in the upper right drawer of her desk.\n\n\n \"It's in your purse,\" I blurted out.\n\n\n I was sent home with a stinging note.\n\n\n Since then I've kept quiet. At one time I assumed everybody was able  to sense. I've known better for years. Still, I wonder how many other  people are as close-mouthed about their special gift as I am about mine.\n\n\n I used to think that some day I'd make a lot of money out of it, but  how? I can't read thoughts. I can't even be sure what some of the  things I sense in probing really are.\n\n\n But I've learned to move things. Ever so little. A piece of paper. A  feather. Once I stopped one of those little glass-enclosed light or  heat-powered devices with vanes you see now and then in a jeweler's  window. And I can stop clocks.\n\n\n Take this morning, for example. I had set my alarm for five-thirty  because I had to catch the seven o'clock plane at San Francisco  International Airport. This being earlier than I usually get up, it  seems all I did during the night was feel my way past the escapement  and balance wheel to see where the notch for the alarm was. The last  time I did it there was just the merest fraction of an inch between the  pawl and the notch. So I sighed and moved to the balance wheel and its  delicate ribbon of spiraling steel. I hung onto the wheel, exerting  influence to decrease the restoring torque.\n\n\n The wheel slowed down until there was no more ticking. It took quite  a bit of effort, as it always does, but I did it, as I usually do. I  can't stand the alarm.\n\n\n When I first learned to do this, I thought I had it made. I even went  to Las Vegas to try my hand, so to speak, with the ratchets and pawls  and cams and springs on the slot machines. But there's nothing delicate  about a slot machine, and the spring tensions are too strong. I dropped  quite a lot of nickels before I finally gave up.\n\n\n So I'm stuck with a talent I've found little real use for. Except that  it amuses me. Sometimes. Not like this time on the plane.\n\n\n The woman beside me stirred, sat up suddenly and looked across me out  the window. \"Where are we?\" she asked in a surprised voice. I told her  we were probably a little north of Bakersfield. She said, \"Oh,\" glanced  at her wristwatch and sank back again.\n\n\n Soon the stewardesses would bring coffee and doughnuts around, so I  contented myself with looking at the clouds and trying to think about  Amos Magaffey, who was purchasing agent for a Los Angeles amusement  chain, and how I was going to convince him our printing prices were  maybe a little higher but the quality and service were better. My mind  wandered below where I was sitting, idly moving from one piece of  luggage to another, looking for my beat-up suitcase. I went through  slips and slippers, lingerie and laundry, a jig saw puzzle and a  ukulele.\n\n\n I never did find my suitcase because I found the bomb first. The bomb was in a small bag\u2014a woman's bag judging by the soft,  flimsy things you'd never find in a man's\u2014and I didn't know it was a  bomb right away. I thought it was just a clock, one of those small,  quiet alarms. I was going to pass it by and go on, but what held me  was that something was taped to it. By the feel, I knew it must be  electrician's tape. Interested and curious, I explored the clock more  closely, found two wires. One went to a battery and the other to hard  round cylinders taped together. The hairs stood up at the base of my  neck when I suddenly realized what it was.\n\n\n The clock's balance wheel was rocking merrily. Quickly I went up past  the train of gears to the alarm wheel. If this was anything like my own  alarm clock, this one had something like ten minutes to go.\n\n\n It was forty minutes to Burbank and Lockheed Air Terminal.\n\n\n My mind was churning when I turned from the window to look around  at the unconcerned passengers, the woman at my side asleep again. I  thought: Which one of these.... No, none of them would know it was  there. I glanced out the window again; clouds were still in the way.  We'd be leaving the valley for the mountain range north of Los Angeles  soon, if we hadn't left it already. No place to land the plane there.\n\n\n But of course that had been the plan!\n\n\n My heart was beating in jackhammer rhythm; my mouth was dry and my mind  was numb. Tell somebody about the bomb before it's too late! No, they'd  think I put it there. Besides, what good would it do? There would be  panic and they'd never get the plane down in time\u2014if they believed me.\n\n\n \"Sir.\" My head jerked around. The stewardess stood in the aisle,  smiling, extending a tray to me, a brown plastic tray bearing a small  paper cup of tomato juice, a cup of coffee, a cellophane-wrapped  doughnut, paper spoon, sugar and dehydrated cream envelopes, and a  napkin.\n\n\n I goggled at her, managed to croak, \"No, thanks.\" She gave me an odd  look and moved along. My seatmate had accepted hers and was tearing at  the cellophane. I couldn't bear to watch her.\n\n\n I closed my eyes, forced my mind back to the luggage compartment, spent  a frantic moment before I found the bag again. I had to stop that  balance wheel, just as I stopped my alarm clock every morning. I tried  to close everything off\u2014the throb of engines, the rush of air, the  woman sipping coffee noisily beside me\u2014and I went into the clock and  surrounded the seesawing wheel. When it went forward, I pulled it back;  when it went back, I pulled it forward. I struggled with it, and it was  like trying to work with greasy hands, and I was afraid I wasn't going  to be able to stop it.\n\n\n Then, little by little, it started to slow its beat. But I could not  afford to relax. I pushed and pulled and didn't dare release my hold  until it came to a dead stop.\n\n\n \"Anything the matter?\"\n\n\n My eyelids flew open and I looked into the eyes of the woman next to  me. There was sugar from the doughnut around her mouth and she was  still chewing.\n\n\n \"No,\" I said, letting out my breath. \"I'm all right.\"\n\n\n \"You were moaning, it sounded like. And you kept moving your head back  and forth.\"\n\n\n \"Must have been dreaming,\" I said as I rang for the stewardess. When  she came I told her I'd take some of that coffee now. No, nothing else,  just coffee. I didn't tell her how much I needed it. I sat there clammy  with sweat until she returned. Coffee never tasted so good. All right, so I had stopped the bomb's timer. My mind raced ahead to  the landing. When they unloaded the luggage, the balance wheel would  start again. I wouldn't be able to stay with it, keeping it still.  I considered telling the authorities as soon as we landed, or maybe  calling in ahead, but wouldn't that just bring suspicion, questions.  Maybe I could convince them I could stop a clock\u2014but not before the  bomb exploded. And then what? My secret would be out and my life would  be changed. I'd be a man not to be trusted, a prying man, a man  literally with gimlet eyes.\n\n\n Mountain crags jutted through the clouds. We were in the range north of  the city. Here and there were clear spots and I could see roads below,  but there were also clouds far above us. It was very beautiful, but it  was also very bumpy, and we started to slip and slide.\n\n\n To my horror I found that the balance wheel was rocking again. Closing  my eyes and gritting my teeth, I forced my senses to the wheel, tugging  and pulling and shoving and pushing until it finally stopped.\n\n\n A jab in the shoulder. I jumped, startled.\n\n\n \"Your cup,\" my seat partner said, pointing.\n\n\n I looked down at the coffee cup I had crushed in my hands. Then I  looked up into the eyes of the stewardess. I handed it to her. She took  it without a word and went away.\n\n\n \"Were you really asleep that time?\"\n\n\n \"Not really,\" I said. I was tempted to tell the woman I was subject to  fits, but I didn't.\n\n\n It was only a few minutes to landing, but they became the longest  minutes of my life as time after time I stopped the rocking wheel when  the plane dipped and bumped to a landing.\n\n\n Leaving the apron with the other passengers, I tried to walk as  unconcernedly as they through the exit gate. I would have liked walking  through the terminal and out the entrance and away, but I could not. I  had my suitcase to get, for one thing. The damned bomb was the other.  So I strolled out into the concourse again to look at the plane and  watch the baggagemen at work, transferring the luggage to two airfield  carts. They weren't as careful as I would have been.\n\n\n It was impossible to tell from this distance just which bag contained  the bomb; I could hardly identify my own scarred suitcase. The  assortment of bags\u2014a strange conglomeration of sizes and colors\u2014was  packed in some places six deep, and it rolled toward the gate where  I was standing. I didn't know whether to stay or run, imagining the  balance wheel now happily rocking again. The load went past me down a  ramp to the front of the air terminal where the luggage was unloaded  and placed in a long rack. I went with it.\n\n\n There was a flurry of ticket matching, hands grabbing for suitcases,  and a general exodus on the part of my fellow passengers, too fast to  determine who had got the one with the bomb. Now all that was left was  the attendant and I had two bags\u2014my own battered veteran of years, and  a fine new red overnight case, small enough to be the one.\n\n\n I lit a cigarette, reached out. Inside were a woman's things and\u2014a  clock. The escapement was clicking vigorously.\n\n\n I didn't moan this time. I just closed my eyes, stretched toward  and grabbed the balance wheel I was getting to know like my own. I  entered into a union with it so strong that after I had reduced it to  immobility, it was like waking when I opened my eyes. The baggage claim attendant was staring at me. For only a moment I  stared back. Then I quickly reached for my baggage check and presented  it to him. His hand hovered over the handle of the little red bag and I  was ready to yell at him. But then, matching numbers on the tags with  his eyes, his hand grasped the handle of my own suitcase and pushed it  toward me.\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" I said, taking it. I glanced ever so casually toward the  remaining bag. \"One left over, eh?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah.\" He was so bored I was tempted to tell him what was in it. But  he was eying me with a \"well-why-don't-you-get-along?\" look.\n\n\n I said, \"What happens if nobody claims it?\"\n\n\n \"Take it inside. Why?\"\n\n\n He was getting too curious. \"Oh, I just wondered, that's all.\"\n\n\n I stepped on my cigarette and walked toward the air terminal entrance  and put my suitcase on the stone steps there. A redcap came hurrying  over.\n\n\n \"Cab?\"\n\n\n I shook my head. \"Just waiting.\"\n\n\n Just waiting for somebody to pick up a bomb.\n\n\n I lit another cigarette and glanced now and then toward the baggage  claim area. The red bag was still there. All sorts of theories ran  through my head as to why it should still be there, and none satisfied  me.\n\n\n I should not have been there, that much I knew; I should be with a  man named Amos Magaffey on Sixth Street at ten o'clock, discussing  something very mundane, the matter of a printing order. But what could  I do? If I left the airport, the attendant would eventually take the  bag inside and there would be an explosion, and I wouldn't be able to  live with myself.\n\n\n No. I had to stay to keep the balance wheel stationary until\u2014until  what?\n\n\n A man in tan gabardine, wearing a police cap and badge, walked out of  the entrance to stand on the stone steps beside me while he put on a  pair of dark glasses. A member of the airport police detail. I could  tell him. I could take him down to the little red bag and explain the  whole thing. Then it would be his baby and I would be off on my own  business.\n\n\n But he moved on down the steps, nodded at the redcap, and started  across the street to the parking area. I could have called to him,  \"Hey, officer, let me tell you about a bomb in a little red bag.\" But  I didn't. I didn't because I caught a movement at the baggage claim  counter out of the side of my eye.\n\n\n The attendant had picked up the bag and was walking with it up the ramp  to the rear of the air terminal. Picking up my own suitcase, I went  inside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bag  on the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk. The  clerk nodded and moved the bag to the rear room.\n\n\n I could visualize the balance wheel once again rocking like crazy. How  many minutes\u2014or seconds\u2014were left? I was sweating when I moved to the  counter, and it wasn't because of the sunshine I'd been soaking in. I  had to get as close to the bag as I could if I was going to stop the  clock again.\n\n\n \"Can I help you?\" the clerk asked.\n\n\n \"No. I'm waiting for someone.\"\n\n\n I turned my back to him, put down my suitcase, leaned against the  counter and reached out for the wheel. I found I could reach the  device, but it was far away. When I tried to dampen it, the wheel  escaped my grasp.\n\n\n \"Do you have my suitcase?\"\n\n\n I blinked my eyes open and looked around. The blonde in the plane stood  there looking very fresh and bright and unconcerned. In her right hand  she had a green baggage claim check.\n\n\n The clerk took it, nodded, and in a moment brought out the overnight  case and set it on the scales. The girl thanked him, picked it up,  glanced at me indifferently, and then started for the entrance with it.\n\n\n \"Just a moment,\" I found myself saying, grabbing my bag and hurrying  after her. At her side and a little ahead of her, I said, \"Listen to me.\"\n\n\n She looked annoyed and increased her stride toward the door.\n\n\n \"It's a matter of life or death,\" I said. I wanted to wrest the bag  from her and hurl it out through the doorway into the street, but I  restrained myself.\n\n\n She stopped and stared. I noticed a short, fat man in a rumpled  suitcoat and unpressed pants staring, too. Ignoring him, I said,  \"Please put the bag down. Over there.\" I indicated a spot beside a  telephone booth where it would be out of the way.\n\n\n She didn't move. She just said, \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"For God's sake!\" I took the case. She offered no resistance. I put her  bag and mine next to the booth. When I turned around she was standing  there looking at me as if I had gone out of my mind. Her eyes were blue  and brown-flecked, very pretty eyes, and my thought at the moment was,  I'm glad the bomb didn't go off; these eyes wouldn't be looking at me  or anything else right now if it had.\n\n\n \"I've got to talk to you. It's very important.\"\n\n\n The girl said, \"Why?\" I was beginning to think it was the only word she  knew. At the same time I was wondering why anyone would want to kill  someone so lovely.\n\n\n \"I'll explain in a moment. Please stand right here while I make a  telephone call.\" I moved toward the phone booth, paused and said, \"And  don't ask me why.\"\n\n\n She gave me a speculative look.\n\n\n I must not have seemed a complete idiot because she said, \"All right,  but\u2014\"\n\n\n I didn't listen for the rest. I went into the booth, closed the door,  pretended to drop a coin and dial a number. But all the time I was in  there, I was reaching out through the glass for the clock. At this  range it wasn't difficult to stop the balance wheel.\n\n\n Just the same, when I came out I was wringing wet.\n\n\n \"Now will you please tell me what this is all about?\" she said stiffly.\n\n\n \"Gladly. Let me buy you a cup of coffee and I'll explain.\"\n\n\n She glanced at the bags. I told her they'd be all right. We followed  the short, fat man into the coffee shop.\n\n\n Over coffee I explained it all to her, how I had this extrasensory  ability, how she was the first person I had ever revealed it to, and  how I had discovered what was in her overnight bag.\n\n\n During the telling, her untouched coffee grew a skin, her face grew  pale, her eyes grew less curious and more troubled. There were tears  there when I finished. I asked her who put the bomb in her bag.\n\n\n \"Joe did,\" she said in a toneless voice, not looking at me any more but  staring vacantly across the room. \"Joe put it there.\" Behind her eyes  she was reliving some recent scene.\n\n\n \"Who is Joe?\"\n\n\n \"My husband.\" I thought she was going to really bawl, but she got  control again. \"This trip was his idea, my coming down here to visit my  sister.\" Her smile was bleak. \"I see now why he wanted to put in those  books. I'd finished packing and was in the bathroom. He said he'd put  in some books we'd both finished reading\u2014for my sister. That's when he  must have put the\u2014put it in there.\"\n\n\n I said gently, \"Why would he want to do a thing like that?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know.\" She shook her head. \"I just don't know.\" And she was  close to bawling again. Then she recovered and said, \"I'm not sure I  want to know.\" I admired her for saying it. Joe must have been crazy.\n\n\n \"It's all right now?\" she asked.\n\n\n I nodded. \"As long as we don't move it.\"\n\n\n I told her I didn't know how much more time there was, that I'd been  thinking it over and that the only way out seemed to be to tell the  airport policeman. After I explained it to her, the girl\u2014she said her  name was Julia Claremont\u2014agreed to tell him she thought there was a  bomb in her bag, that she had noticed a ticking and had become worried  because she knew she hadn't packed a clock. It wasn't good, but it  would have to do.\n\n\n \"We've got to get it deactivated,\" I said, watching the fat man pay for  his coffee and leave. \"The sooner the better.\" I finished my coffee in one gulp and went to pay the bill with her.  I asked her why she didn't claim the bag at the same time the other  people had. She said she had called her sister and the phone was busy  for a long while.\n\n\n \"She was supposed to meet me, and when she wasn't here, I got worried.  She said she isn't feeling well and asked me to take a cab.\" She smiled  a little. It was a bright, cheery thing. I had the feeling it was all  for me. \"That's where I was going when you caught up with me.\"\n\n\n It had become a very nice day. But the bottom dropped out of it again  when we reached the lobby.\n\n\n The two bags weren't there.\n\n\n I ran to the entrance and nearly collided with the redcap.\n\n\n \"See anybody go out of here with a little red bag and an old battered  suitcase?\"\n\n\n \"Bag? Suitcase?\" he mumbled. Then he became excited. \"Why, a man just  stepped out of here\u2014\" He turned to look down the street. \"That's him.\"\n\n\n The dumpy man I'd seen was walking off; Julia's bag in his right hand,  mine in his left. He seemed in no hurry.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" I shouted, starting toward him.\n\n\n The man turned, took one look at me, and started to run. He came  abreast an old gray, mud-spattered coupe, ran around, opened the door  and threw both bags into the rear seat as he got in.\n\n\n The car was a hundred feet away and gathering speed by the time I  reached where it had been parked. I watched it for a moment, then  walked back to the entranceway where Julia was standing with the  redcap, who said, \"That man steal them suitcases?\"\n\n\n \"That he did,\" I said.\n\n\n Just then the airport policeman started across the street from the  parking lot. Redcap said, \"Better tell him about it.\"\n\n\n The policeman was sympathetic and concerned. He said, \"We'd better get  over to the office.\"\n\n\n But we never left the spot because an explosion some blocks distant  shattered the air. Julia's hand grasped my arm. Hard.\n\n\n \"Jets,\" the redcap said, eying the sky.\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" the policeman said. \"Didn't sound much like a jet to  me.\"\n\n\n We stood there. I could visualize the wreckage of an old gray coupe  in the middle of a street, but I couldn't visualize the driver. That  was all right. I didn't want to see him. I didn't know what Julia was  thinking.\n\n\n She said, \"About those bags,\" and looked at me.\n\n\n The officer said, \"Yes, miss?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't care about mine. I didn't have much of anything in it.\"\n\n\n \"I feel the same way,\" I said. \"Would it be all right if we didn't  bother to report it?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" the policeman said, \"I can't make you report it.\"\n\n\n \"I'd rather not then,\" Julia said. She turned to me. \"I'd like some  air. Can't we walk a little?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I said.\n\n\n We started down the street, her arm in mine, as the air began to fill  with the distant sounds of sirens. ",

Mine was no   satisfaction, never earned me a penny\u2014and   now it had me fighting for my life in ... THE LITTLE RED BAG By JERRY SOHL [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, January 1960.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] About an hour out of San Francisco on the flight to Los Angeles, I made  the discovery. I had finished reading the Chronicle , folded and put  it beside me, turned and looked out the window, expecting to see the  San Joaquin Valley but finding only a sea of clouds instead. So I  returned my attention to the inside of the plane, to the overstuffed  gray-haired woman asleep beside me, to the backs of heads in seats  before me, across the aisle to other heads, and down to the blonde.\n\n\n I had seen her in the concourse and at the gate, a shapely thing. Now  she had crossed her legs and I was privileged to view a trim ankle and  calf, and her profile as she stared moodily across the aisle and out a  window where there was nothing to see.\n\n\n I slid my eyes past her to others. A crossword-puzzle worker, a  togetherness-type-magazine reader.\n\n\n Inventory completed, I went back to looking at the clouds, knowing I  should be thinking about the printing order I was going to Los Angeles  for, and not wanting to.\n\n\n So I started going through the purse of the woman next to me. Perhaps  that sounds bad. It wasn't. I'd been doing it for years and nobody ever  complained.\n\n\n It started when I was a kid, this business of being able to explore  the insides of things like purses and sealed boxes and locked drawers  and\u2014well, human beings. But human beings aren't worth the trouble.  It's like swimming through spaghetti. And I've got to stay away from  electric wires. They hurt. Now don't ask me how they hurt.\n\n\n Maybe you think it's fun. For the most part, it really isn't. I always  knew what was in Christmas presents before I unwrapped them, and  therefore Christmas was always spoiled for me as a kid. I can't feel  the color of anything, just its consistency. An apple senses about the  same as a potato, except for the core and the stem. I can't even tell  if there's writing on a piece of paper. So you see it isn't much. Just  the feel of shapes, the hardnesses and softnesses. But I've learned to  become pretty good at guessing.\n\n\n Like this woman next to me. She had a short, cylindrical metal object  in her purse with waxlike stuff inside it\u2014a lipstick. A round, hard  object with dust inside\u2014a compact. Handkerchief, chewing gum, a small  book, probably an address book, money in a change purse\u2014a few bills  and coins. Not much else.\n\n\n I was a little disappointed. I've run across a gun or two in my time.  But I never say anything. I learned the wisdom of keeping my mouth shut in the fourth grade when  Miss Winters, a stern, white-haired disciplinarian, ordered me to eat  my sack lunch in the classroom with her instead of outside with some  of the other kids. This was the punishment for some minor infraction.  Lunchtime was nearly over and we'd both finished eating; she said she'd  be gone for a few moments and that I was to erase the blackboard during  her absence, which I dutifully did.\n\n\n Class had hardly resumed when she started looking around the desk for  her favorite mechanical pencil, asking if any of us had seen it, and  looking straight at me. I didn't want her to think I had taken it while  she was out of the room, so I probed the contents of her purse, which  she always kept in the upper right drawer of her desk.\n\n\n \"It's in your purse,\" I blurted out.\n\n\n I was sent home with a stinging note.\n\n\n Since then I've kept quiet. At one time I assumed everybody was able  to sense. I've known better for years. Still, I wonder how many other  people are as close-mouthed about their special gift as I am about mine.\n\n\n I used to think that some day I'd make a lot of money out of it, but  how? I can't read thoughts. I can't even be sure what some of the  things I sense in probing really are.\n\n\n But I've learned to move things. Ever so little. A piece of paper. A  feather. Once I stopped one of those little glass-enclosed light or  heat-powered devices with vanes you see now and then in a jeweler's  window. And I can stop clocks.\n\n\n Take this morning, for example. I had set my alarm for five-thirty  because I had to catch the seven o'clock plane at San Francisco  International Airport. This being earlier than I usually get up, it  seems all I did during the night was feel my way past the escapement  and balance wheel to see where the notch for the alarm was. The last  time I did it there was just the merest fraction of an inch between the  pawl and the notch. So I sighed and moved to the balance wheel and its  delicate ribbon of spiraling steel. I hung onto the wheel, exerting  influence to decrease the restoring torque.\n\n\n The wheel slowed down until there was no more ticking. It took quite  a bit of effort, as it always does, but I did it, as I usually do. I  can't stand the alarm.\n\n\n When I first learned to do this, I thought I had it made. I even went  to Las Vegas to try my hand, so to speak, with the ratchets and pawls  and cams and springs on the slot machines. But there's nothing delicate  about a slot machine, and the spring tensions are too strong. I dropped  quite a lot of nickels before I finally gave up.\n\n\n So I'm stuck with a talent I've found little real use for. Except that  it amuses me. Sometimes. Not like this time on the plane.\n\n\n The woman beside me stirred, sat up suddenly and looked across me out  the window. \"Where are we?\" she asked in a surprised voice. I told her  we were probably a little north of Bakersfield. She said, \"Oh,\" glanced  at her wristwatch and sank back again.\n\n\n Soon the stewardesses would bring coffee and doughnuts around, so I  contented myself with looking at the clouds and trying to think about  Amos Magaffey, who was purchasing agent for a Los Angeles amusement  chain, and how I was going to convince him our printing prices were  maybe a little higher but the quality and service were better. My mind  wandered below where I was sitting, idly moving from one piece of  luggage to another, looking for my beat-up suitcase. I went through  slips and slippers, lingerie and laundry, a jig saw puzzle and a  ukulele.\n\n\n I never did find my suitcase because I found the bomb first. The bomb was in a small bag\u2014a woman's bag judging by the soft,  flimsy things you'd never find in a man's\u2014and I didn't know it was a  bomb right away. I thought it was just a clock, one of those small,  quiet alarms. I was going to pass it by and go on, but what held me  was that something was taped to it. By the feel, I knew it must be  electrician's tape. Interested and curious, I explored the clock more  closely, found two wires. One went to a battery and the other to hard  round cylinders taped together. The hairs stood up at the base of my  neck when I suddenly realized what it was.\n\n\n The clock's balance wheel was rocking merrily. Quickly I went up past  the train of gears to the alarm wheel. If this was anything like my own  alarm clock, this one had something like ten minutes to go.\n\n\n It was forty minutes to Burbank and Lockheed Air Terminal.\n\n\n My mind was churning when I turned from the window to look around  at the unconcerned passengers, the woman at my side asleep again. I  thought: Which one of these.... No, none of them would know it was  there. I glanced out the window again; clouds were still in the way.  We'd be leaving the valley for the mountain range north of Los Angeles  soon, if we hadn't left it already. No place to land the plane there.\n\n\n But of course that had been the plan!\n\n\n My heart was beating in jackhammer rhythm; my mouth was dry and my mind  was numb. Tell somebody about the bomb before it's too late! No, they'd  think I put it there. Besides, what good would it do? There would be  panic and they'd never get the plane down in time\u2014if they believed me.\n\n\n \"Sir.\" My head jerked around. The stewardess stood in the aisle,  smiling, extending a tray to me, a brown plastic tray bearing a small  paper cup of tomato juice, a cup of coffee, a cellophane-wrapped  doughnut, paper spoon, sugar and dehydrated cream envelopes, and a  napkin.\n\n\n I goggled at her, managed to croak, \"No, thanks.\" She gave me an odd  look and moved along. My seatmate had accepted hers and was tearing at  the cellophane. I couldn't bear to watch her.\n\n\n I closed my eyes, forced my mind back to the luggage compartment, spent  a frantic moment before I found the bag again. I had to stop that  balance wheel, just as I stopped my alarm clock every morning. I tried  to close everything off\u2014the throb of engines, the rush of air, the  woman sipping coffee noisily beside me\u2014and I went into the clock and  surrounded the seesawing wheel. When it went forward, I pulled it back;  when it went back, I pulled it forward. I struggled with it, and it was  like trying to work with greasy hands, and I was afraid I wasn't going  to be able to stop it.\n\n\n Then, little by little, it started to slow its beat. But I could not  afford to relax. I pushed and pulled and didn't dare release my hold  until it came to a dead stop.\n\n\n \"Anything the matter?\"\n\n\n My eyelids flew open and I looked into the eyes of the woman next to  me. There was sugar from the doughnut around her mouth and she was  still chewing.\n\n\n \"No,\" I said, letting out my breath. \"I'm all right.\"\n\n\n \"You were moaning, it sounded like. And you kept moving your head back  and forth.\"\n\n\n \"Must have been dreaming,\" I said as I rang for the stewardess. When  she came I told her I'd take some of that coffee now. No, nothing else,  just coffee. I didn't tell her how much I needed it. I sat there clammy  with sweat until she returned. Coffee never tasted so good. All right, so I had stopped the bomb's timer. My mind raced ahead to  the landing. When they unloaded the luggage, the balance wheel would  start again. I wouldn't be able to stay with it, keeping it still.  I considered telling the authorities as soon as we landed, or maybe  calling in ahead, but wouldn't that just bring suspicion, questions.  Maybe I could convince them I could stop a clock\u2014but not before the  bomb exploded. And then what? My secret would be out and my life would  be changed. I'd be a man not to be trusted, a prying man, a man  literally with gimlet eyes.\n\n\n Mountain crags jutted through the clouds. We were in the range north of  the city. Here and there were clear spots and I could see roads below,  but there were also clouds far above us. It was very beautiful, but it  was also very bumpy, and we started to slip and slide.\n\n\n To my horror I found that the balance wheel was rocking again. Closing  my eyes and gritting my teeth, I forced my senses to the wheel, tugging  and pulling and shoving and pushing until it finally stopped.\n\n\n A jab in the shoulder. I jumped, startled.\n\n\n \"Your cup,\" my seat partner said, pointing.\n\n\n I looked down at the coffee cup I had crushed in my hands. Then I  looked up into the eyes of the stewardess. I handed it to her. She took  it without a word and went away.\n\n\n \"Were you really asleep that time?\"\n\n\n \"Not really,\" I said. I was tempted to tell the woman I was subject to  fits, but I didn't.\n\n\n It was only a few minutes to landing, but they became the longest  minutes of my life as time after time I stopped the rocking wheel when  the plane dipped and bumped to a landing.\n\n\n Leaving the apron with the other passengers, I tried to walk as  unconcernedly as they through the exit gate. I would have liked walking  through the terminal and out the entrance and away, but I could not. I  had my suitcase to get, for one thing. The damned bomb was the other.  So I strolled out into the concourse again to look at the plane and  watch the baggagemen at work, transferring the luggage to two airfield  carts. They weren't as careful as I would have been.\n\n\n It was impossible to tell from this distance just which bag contained  the bomb; I could hardly identify my own scarred suitcase. The  assortment of bags\u2014a strange conglomeration of sizes and colors\u2014was  packed in some places six deep, and it rolled toward the gate where  I was standing. I didn't know whether to stay or run, imagining the  balance wheel now happily rocking again. The load went past me down a  ramp to the front of the air terminal where the luggage was unloaded  and placed in a long rack. I went with it.\n\n\n There was a flurry of ticket matching, hands grabbing for suitcases,  and a general exodus on the part of my fellow passengers, too fast to  determine who had got the one with the bomb. Now all that was left was  the attendant and I had two bags\u2014my own battered veteran of years, and  a fine new red overnight case, small enough to be the one.\n\n\n I lit a cigarette, reached out. Inside were a woman's things and\u2014a  clock. The escapement was clicking vigorously.\n\n\n I didn't moan this time. I just closed my eyes, stretched toward  and grabbed the balance wheel I was getting to know like my own. I  entered into a union with it so strong that after I had reduced it to  immobility, it was like waking when I opened my eyes. The baggage claim attendant was staring at me. For only a moment I  stared back. Then I quickly reached for my baggage check and presented  it to him. His hand hovered over the handle of the little red bag and I  was ready to yell at him. But then, matching numbers on the tags with  his eyes, his hand grasped the handle of my own suitcase and pushed it  toward me.\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" I said, taking it. I glanced ever so casually toward the  remaining bag. \"One left over, eh?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah.\" He was so bored I was tempted to tell him what was in it. But  he was eying me with a \"well-why-don't-you-get-along?\" look.\n\n\n I said, \"What happens if nobody claims it?\"\n\n\n \"Take it inside. Why?\"\n\n\n He was getting too curious. \"Oh, I just wondered, that's all.\"\n\n\n I stepped on my cigarette and walked toward the air terminal entrance  and put my suitcase on the stone steps there. A redcap came hurrying  over.\n\n\n \"Cab?\"\n\n\n I shook my head. \"Just waiting.\"\n\n\n Just waiting for somebody to pick up a bomb.\n\n\n I lit another cigarette and glanced now and then toward the baggage  claim area. The red bag was still there. All sorts of theories ran  through my head as to why it should still be there, and none satisfied  me.\n\n\n I should not have been there, that much I knew; I should be with a  man named Amos Magaffey on Sixth Street at ten o'clock, discussing  something very mundane, the matter of a printing order. But what could  I do? If I left the airport, the attendant would eventually take the  bag inside and there would be an explosion, and I wouldn't be able to  live with myself.\n\n\n No. I had to stay to keep the balance wheel stationary until\u2014until  what?\n\n\n A man in tan gabardine, wearing a police cap and badge, walked out of  the entrance to stand on the stone steps beside me while he put on a  pair of dark glasses. A member of the airport police detail. I could  tell him. I could take him down to the little red bag and explain the  whole thing. Then it would be his baby and I would be off on my own  business.\n\n\n But he moved on down the steps, nodded at the redcap, and started  across the street to the parking area. I could have called to him,  \"Hey, officer, let me tell you about a bomb in a little red bag.\" But  I didn't. I didn't because I caught a movement at the baggage claim  counter out of the side of my eye.\n\n\n The attendant had picked up the bag and was walking with it up the ramp  to the rear of the air terminal. Picking up my own suitcase, I went  inside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bag  on the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk. The  clerk nodded and moved the bag to the rear room.\n\n\n I could visualize the balance wheel once again rocking like crazy. How  many minutes\u2014or seconds\u2014were left? I was sweating when I moved to the  counter, and it wasn't because of the sunshine I'd been soaking in. I  had to get as close to the bag as I could if I was going to stop the  clock again.\n\n\n \"Can I help you?\" the clerk asked.\n\n\n \"No. I'm waiting for someone.\"\n\n\n I turned my back to him, put down my suitcase, leaned against the  counter and reached out for the wheel. I found I could reach the  device, but it was far away. When I tried to dampen it, the wheel  escaped my grasp.\n\n\n \"Do you have my suitcase?\"\n\n\n I blinked my eyes open and looked around. The blonde in the plane stood  there looking very fresh and bright and unconcerned. In her right hand  she had a green baggage claim check.\n\n\n The clerk took it, nodded, and in a moment brought out the overnight  case and set it on the scales. The girl thanked him, picked it up,  glanced at me indifferently, and then started for the entrance with it.\n\n\n \"Just a moment,\" I found myself saying, grabbing my bag and hurrying  after her. At her side and a little ahead of her, I said, \"Listen to me.\"\n\n\n She looked annoyed and increased her stride toward the door.\n\n\n \"It's a matter of life or death,\" I said. I wanted to wrest the bag  from her and hurl it out through the doorway into the street, but I  restrained myself.\n\n\n She stopped and stared. I noticed a short, fat man in a rumpled  suitcoat and unpressed pants staring, too. Ignoring him, I said,  \"Please put the bag down. Over there.\" I indicated a spot beside a  telephone booth where it would be out of the way.\n\n\n She didn't move. She just said, \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"For God's sake!\" I took the case. She offered no resistance. I put her  bag and mine next to the booth. When I turned around she was standing  there looking at me as if I had gone out of my mind. Her eyes were blue  and brown-flecked, very pretty eyes, and my thought at the moment was,  I'm glad the bomb didn't go off; these eyes wouldn't be looking at me  or anything else right now if it had.\n\n\n \"I've got to talk to you. It's very important.\"\n\n\n The girl said, \"Why?\" I was beginning to think it was the only word she  knew. At the same time I was wondering why anyone would want to kill  someone so lovely.\n\n\n \"I'll explain in a moment. Please stand right here while I make a  telephone call.\" I moved toward the phone booth, paused and said, \"And  don't ask me why.\"\n\n\n She gave me a speculative look.\n\n\n I must not have seemed a complete idiot because she said, \"All right,  but\u2014\"\n\n\n I didn't listen for the rest. I went into the booth, closed the door,  pretended to drop a coin and dial a number. But all the time I was in  there, I was reaching out through the glass for the clock. At this  range it wasn't difficult to stop the balance wheel.\n\n\n Just the same, when I came out I was wringing wet.\n\n\n \"Now will you please tell me what this is all about?\" she said stiffly.\n\n\n \"Gladly. Let me buy you a cup of coffee and I'll explain.\"\n\n\n She glanced at the bags. I told her they'd be all right. We followed  the short, fat man into the coffee shop.\n\n\n Over coffee I explained it all to her, how I had this extrasensory  ability, how she was the first person I had ever revealed it to, and  how I had discovered what was in her overnight bag.\n\n\n During the telling, her untouched coffee grew a skin, her face grew  pale, her eyes grew less curious and more troubled. There were tears  there when I finished. I asked her who put the bomb in her bag.\n\n\n \"Joe did,\" she said in a toneless voice, not looking at me any more but  staring vacantly across the room. \"Joe put it there.\" Behind her eyes  she was reliving some recent scene.\n\n\n \"Who is Joe?\"\n\n\n \"My husband.\" I thought she was going to really bawl, but she got  control again. \"This trip was his idea, my coming down here to visit my  sister.\" Her smile was bleak. \"I see now why he wanted to put in those  books. I'd finished packing and was in the bathroom. He said he'd put  in some books we'd both finished reading\u2014for my sister. That's when he  must have put the\u2014put it in there.\"\n\n\n I said gently, \"Why would he want to do a thing like that?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know.\" She shook her head. \"I just don't know.\" And she was  close to bawling again. Then she recovered and said, \"I'm not sure I  want to know.\" I admired her for saying it. Joe must have been crazy.\n\n\n \"It's all right now?\" she asked.\n\n\n I nodded. \"As long as we don't move it.\"\n\n\n I told her I didn't know how much more time there was, that I'd been  thinking it over and that the only way out seemed to be to tell the  airport policeman. After I explained it to her, the girl\u2014she said her  name was Julia Claremont\u2014agreed to tell him she thought there was a  bomb in her bag, that she had noticed a ticking and had become worried  because she knew she hadn't packed a clock. It wasn't good, but it  would have to do.\n\n\n \"We've got to get it deactivated,\" I said, watching the fat man pay for  his coffee and leave. \"The sooner the better.\" I finished my coffee in one gulp and went to pay the bill with her.  I asked her why she didn't claim the bag at the same time the other  people had. She said she had called her sister and the phone was busy  for a long while.\n\n\n \"She was supposed to meet me, and when she wasn't here, I got worried.  She said she isn't feeling well and asked me to take a cab.\" She smiled  a little. It was a bright, cheery thing. I had the feeling it was all  for me. \"That's where I was going when you caught up with me.\"\n\n\n It had become a very nice day. But the bottom dropped out of it again  when we reached the lobby.\n\n\n The two bags weren't there.\n\n\n I ran to the entrance and nearly collided with the redcap.\n\n\n \"See anybody go out of here with a little red bag and an old battered  suitcase?\"\n\n\n \"Bag? Suitcase?\" he mumbled. Then he became excited. \"Why, a man just  stepped out of here\u2014\" He turned to look down the street. \"That's him.\"\n\n\n The dumpy man I'd seen was walking off; Julia's bag in his right hand,  mine in his left. He seemed in no hurry.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" I shouted, starting toward him.\n\n\n The man turned, took one look at me, and started to run. He came  abreast an old gray, mud-spattered coupe, ran around, opened the door  and threw both bags into the rear seat as he got in.\n\n\n The car was a hundred feet away and gathering speed by the time I  reached where it had been parked. I watched it for a moment, then  walked back to the entranceway where Julia was standing with the  redcap, who said, \"That man steal them suitcases?\"\n\n\n \"That he did,\" I said.\n\n\n Just then the airport policeman started across the street from the  parking lot. Redcap said, \"Better tell him about it.\"\n\n\n The policeman was sympathetic and concerned. He said, \"We'd better get  over to the office.\"\n\n\n But we never left the spot because an explosion some blocks distant  shattered the air. Julia's hand grasped my arm. Hard.\n\n\n \"Jets,\" the redcap said, eying the sky.\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" the policeman said. \"Didn't sound much like a jet to  me.\"\n\n\n We stood there. I could visualize the wreckage of an old gray coupe  in the middle of a street, but I couldn't visualize the driver. That  was all right. I didn't want to see him. I didn't know what Julia was  thinking.\n\n\n She said, \"About those bags,\" and looked at me.\n\n\n The officer said, \"Yes, miss?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't care about mine. I didn't have much of anything in it.\"\n\n\n \"I feel the same way,\" I said. \"Would it be all right if we didn't  bother to report it?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" the policeman said, \"I can't make you report it.\"\n\n\n \"I'd rather not then,\" Julia said. She turned to me. \"I'd like some  air. Can't we walk a little?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I said.\n\n\n We started down the street, her arm in mine, as the air began to fill  with the distant sounds of sirens. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich is the best description of how Julia reacted to the narrator trying to take her bag?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She was unsettled because a strange man had approached her trying to take her things\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She was surprised enough by the request that she wasn't quite sure how to react\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She was surprised enough by the request that she wasn't quite sure how to react\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She was surprised enough by the request that she wasn't quite sure how to react\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Mine was no   satisfaction, never earned me a penny\u2014and   now it had me fighting for my life in ... THE LITTLE RED BAG By JERRY SOHL [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, January 1960.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] About an hour out of San Francisco on the flight to Los Angeles, I made  the discovery. I had finished reading the Chronicle , folded and put  it beside me, turned and looked out the window, expecting to see the  San Joaquin Valley but finding only a sea of clouds instead. So I  returned my attention to the inside of the plane, to the overstuffed  gray-haired woman asleep beside me, to the backs of heads in seats  before me, across the aisle to other heads, and down to the blonde.\n\n\n I had seen her in the concourse and at the gate, a shapely thing. Now  she had crossed her legs and I was privileged to view a trim ankle and  calf, and her profile as she stared moodily across the aisle and out a  window where there was nothing to see.\n\n\n I slid my eyes past her to others. A crossword-puzzle worker, a  togetherness-type-magazine reader.\n\n\n Inventory completed, I went back to looking at the clouds, knowing I  should be thinking about the printing order I was going to Los Angeles  for, and not wanting to.\n\n\n So I started going through the purse of the woman next to me. Perhaps  that sounds bad. It wasn't. I'd been doing it for years and nobody ever  complained.\n\n\n It started when I was a kid, this business of being able to explore  the insides of things like purses and sealed boxes and locked drawers  and\u2014well, human beings. But human beings aren't worth the trouble.  It's like swimming through spaghetti. And I've got to stay away from  electric wires. They hurt. Now don't ask me how they hurt.\n\n\n Maybe you think it's fun. For the most part, it really isn't. I always  knew what was in Christmas presents before I unwrapped them, and  therefore Christmas was always spoiled for me as a kid. I can't feel  the color of anything, just its consistency. An apple senses about the  same as a potato, except for the core and the stem. I can't even tell  if there's writing on a piece of paper. So you see it isn't much. Just  the feel of shapes, the hardnesses and softnesses. But I've learned to  become pretty good at guessing.\n\n\n Like this woman next to me. She had a short, cylindrical metal object  in her purse with waxlike stuff inside it\u2014a lipstick. A round, hard  object with dust inside\u2014a compact. Handkerchief, chewing gum, a small  book, probably an address book, money in a change purse\u2014a few bills  and coins. Not much else.\n\n\n I was a little disappointed. I've run across a gun or two in my time.  But I never say anything. I learned the wisdom of keeping my mouth shut in the fourth grade when  Miss Winters, a stern, white-haired disciplinarian, ordered me to eat  my sack lunch in the classroom with her instead of outside with some  of the other kids. This was the punishment for some minor infraction.  Lunchtime was nearly over and we'd both finished eating; she said she'd  be gone for a few moments and that I was to erase the blackboard during  her absence, which I dutifully did.\n\n\n Class had hardly resumed when she started looking around the desk for  her favorite mechanical pencil, asking if any of us had seen it, and  looking straight at me. I didn't want her to think I had taken it while  she was out of the room, so I probed the contents of her purse, which  she always kept in the upper right drawer of her desk.\n\n\n \"It's in your purse,\" I blurted out.\n\n\n I was sent home with a stinging note.\n\n\n Since then I've kept quiet. At one time I assumed everybody was able  to sense. I've known better for years. Still, I wonder how many other  people are as close-mouthed about their special gift as I am about mine.\n\n\n I used to think that some day I'd make a lot of money out of it, but  how? I can't read thoughts. I can't even be sure what some of the  things I sense in probing really are.\n\n\n But I've learned to move things. Ever so little. A piece of paper. A  feather. Once I stopped one of those little glass-enclosed light or  heat-powered devices with vanes you see now and then in a jeweler's  window. And I can stop clocks.\n\n\n Take this morning, for example. I had set my alarm for five-thirty  because I had to catch the seven o'clock plane at San Francisco  International Airport. This being earlier than I usually get up, it  seems all I did during the night was feel my way past the escapement  and balance wheel to see where the notch for the alarm was. The last  time I did it there was just the merest fraction of an inch between the  pawl and the notch. So I sighed and moved to the balance wheel and its  delicate ribbon of spiraling steel. I hung onto the wheel, exerting  influence to decrease the restoring torque.\n\n\n The wheel slowed down until there was no more ticking. It took quite  a bit of effort, as it always does, but I did it, as I usually do. I  can't stand the alarm.\n\n\n When I first learned to do this, I thought I had it made. I even went  to Las Vegas to try my hand, so to speak, with the ratchets and pawls  and cams and springs on the slot machines. But there's nothing delicate  about a slot machine, and the spring tensions are too strong. I dropped  quite a lot of nickels before I finally gave up.\n\n\n So I'm stuck with a talent I've found little real use for. Except that  it amuses me. Sometimes. Not like this time on the plane.\n\n\n The woman beside me stirred, sat up suddenly and looked across me out  the window. \"Where are we?\" she asked in a surprised voice. I told her  we were probably a little north of Bakersfield. She said, \"Oh,\" glanced  at her wristwatch and sank back again.\n\n\n Soon the stewardesses would bring coffee and doughnuts around, so I  contented myself with looking at the clouds and trying to think about  Amos Magaffey, who was purchasing agent for a Los Angeles amusement  chain, and how I was going to convince him our printing prices were  maybe a little higher but the quality and service were better. My mind  wandered below where I was sitting, idly moving from one piece of  luggage to another, looking for my beat-up suitcase. I went through  slips and slippers, lingerie and laundry, a jig saw puzzle and a  ukulele.\n\n\n I never did find my suitcase because I found the bomb first. The bomb was in a small bag\u2014a woman's bag judging by the soft,  flimsy things you'd never find in a man's\u2014and I didn't know it was a  bomb right away. I thought it was just a clock, one of those small,  quiet alarms. I was going to pass it by and go on, but what held me  was that something was taped to it. By the feel, I knew it must be  electrician's tape. Interested and curious, I explored the clock more  closely, found two wires. One went to a battery and the other to hard  round cylinders taped together. The hairs stood up at the base of my  neck when I suddenly realized what it was.\n\n\n The clock's balance wheel was rocking merrily. Quickly I went up past  the train of gears to the alarm wheel. If this was anything like my own  alarm clock, this one had something like ten minutes to go.\n\n\n It was forty minutes to Burbank and Lockheed Air Terminal.\n\n\n My mind was churning when I turned from the window to look around  at the unconcerned passengers, the woman at my side asleep again. I  thought: Which one of these.... No, none of them would know it was  there. I glanced out the window again; clouds were still in the way.  We'd be leaving the valley for the mountain range north of Los Angeles  soon, if we hadn't left it already. No place to land the plane there.\n\n\n But of course that had been the plan!\n\n\n My heart was beating in jackhammer rhythm; my mouth was dry and my mind  was numb. Tell somebody about the bomb before it's too late! No, they'd  think I put it there. Besides, what good would it do? There would be  panic and they'd never get the plane down in time\u2014if they believed me.\n\n\n \"Sir.\" My head jerked around. The stewardess stood in the aisle,  smiling, extending a tray to me, a brown plastic tray bearing a small  paper cup of tomato juice, a cup of coffee, a cellophane-wrapped  doughnut, paper spoon, sugar and dehydrated cream envelopes, and a  napkin.\n\n\n I goggled at her, managed to croak, \"No, thanks.\" She gave me an odd  look and moved along. My seatmate had accepted hers and was tearing at  the cellophane. I couldn't bear to watch her.\n\n\n I closed my eyes, forced my mind back to the luggage compartment, spent  a frantic moment before I found the bag again. I had to stop that  balance wheel, just as I stopped my alarm clock every morning. I tried  to close everything off\u2014the throb of engines, the rush of air, the  woman sipping coffee noisily beside me\u2014and I went into the clock and  surrounded the seesawing wheel. When it went forward, I pulled it back;  when it went back, I pulled it forward. I struggled with it, and it was  like trying to work with greasy hands, and I was afraid I wasn't going  to be able to stop it.\n\n\n Then, little by little, it started to slow its beat. But I could not  afford to relax. I pushed and pulled and didn't dare release my hold  until it came to a dead stop.\n\n\n \"Anything the matter?\"\n\n\n My eyelids flew open and I looked into the eyes of the woman next to  me. There was sugar from the doughnut around her mouth and she was  still chewing.\n\n\n \"No,\" I said, letting out my breath. \"I'm all right.\"\n\n\n \"You were moaning, it sounded like. And you kept moving your head back  and forth.\"\n\n\n \"Must have been dreaming,\" I said as I rang for the stewardess. When  she came I told her I'd take some of that coffee now. No, nothing else,  just coffee. I didn't tell her how much I needed it. I sat there clammy  with sweat until she returned. Coffee never tasted so good. All right, so I had stopped the bomb's timer. My mind raced ahead to  the landing. When they unloaded the luggage, the balance wheel would  start again. I wouldn't be able to stay with it, keeping it still.  I considered telling the authorities as soon as we landed, or maybe  calling in ahead, but wouldn't that just bring suspicion, questions.  Maybe I could convince them I could stop a clock\u2014but not before the  bomb exploded. And then what? My secret would be out and my life would  be changed. I'd be a man not to be trusted, a prying man, a man  literally with gimlet eyes.\n\n\n Mountain crags jutted through the clouds. We were in the range north of  the city. Here and there were clear spots and I could see roads below,  but there were also clouds far above us. It was very beautiful, but it  was also very bumpy, and we started to slip and slide.\n\n\n To my horror I found that the balance wheel was rocking again. Closing  my eyes and gritting my teeth, I forced my senses to the wheel, tugging  and pulling and shoving and pushing until it finally stopped.\n\n\n A jab in the shoulder. I jumped, startled.\n\n\n \"Your cup,\" my seat partner said, pointing.\n\n\n I looked down at the coffee cup I had crushed in my hands. Then I  looked up into the eyes of the stewardess. I handed it to her. She took  it without a word and went away.\n\n\n \"Were you really asleep that time?\"\n\n\n \"Not really,\" I said. I was tempted to tell the woman I was subject to  fits, but I didn't.\n\n\n It was only a few minutes to landing, but they became the longest  minutes of my life as time after time I stopped the rocking wheel when  the plane dipped and bumped to a landing.\n\n\n Leaving the apron with the other passengers, I tried to walk as  unconcernedly as they through the exit gate. I would have liked walking  through the terminal and out the entrance and away, but I could not. I  had my suitcase to get, for one thing. The damned bomb was the other.  So I strolled out into the concourse again to look at the plane and  watch the baggagemen at work, transferring the luggage to two airfield  carts. They weren't as careful as I would have been.\n\n\n It was impossible to tell from this distance just which bag contained  the bomb; I could hardly identify my own scarred suitcase. The  assortment of bags\u2014a strange conglomeration of sizes and colors\u2014was  packed in some places six deep, and it rolled toward the gate where  I was standing. I didn't know whether to stay or run, imagining the  balance wheel now happily rocking again. The load went past me down a  ramp to the front of the air terminal where the luggage was unloaded  and placed in a long rack. I went with it.\n\n\n There was a flurry of ticket matching, hands grabbing for suitcases,  and a general exodus on the part of my fellow passengers, too fast to  determine who had got the one with the bomb. Now all that was left was  the attendant and I had two bags\u2014my own battered veteran of years, and  a fine new red overnight case, small enough to be the one.\n\n\n I lit a cigarette, reached out. Inside were a woman's things and\u2014a  clock. The escapement was clicking vigorously.\n\n\n I didn't moan this time. I just closed my eyes, stretched toward  and grabbed the balance wheel I was getting to know like my own. I  entered into a union with it so strong that after I had reduced it to  immobility, it was like waking when I opened my eyes. The baggage claim attendant was staring at me. For only a moment I  stared back. Then I quickly reached for my baggage check and presented  it to him. His hand hovered over the handle of the little red bag and I  was ready to yell at him. But then, matching numbers on the tags with  his eyes, his hand grasped the handle of my own suitcase and pushed it  toward me.\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" I said, taking it. I glanced ever so casually toward the  remaining bag. \"One left over, eh?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah.\" He was so bored I was tempted to tell him what was in it. But  he was eying me with a \"well-why-don't-you-get-along?\" look.\n\n\n I said, \"What happens if nobody claims it?\"\n\n\n \"Take it inside. Why?\"\n\n\n He was getting too curious. \"Oh, I just wondered, that's all.\"\n\n\n I stepped on my cigarette and walked toward the air terminal entrance  and put my suitcase on the stone steps there. A redcap came hurrying  over.\n\n\n \"Cab?\"\n\n\n I shook my head. \"Just waiting.\"\n\n\n Just waiting for somebody to pick up a bomb.\n\n\n I lit another cigarette and glanced now and then toward the baggage  claim area. The red bag was still there. All sorts of theories ran  through my head as to why it should still be there, and none satisfied  me.\n\n\n I should not have been there, that much I knew; I should be with a  man named Amos Magaffey on Sixth Street at ten o'clock, discussing  something very mundane, the matter of a printing order. But what could  I do? If I left the airport, the attendant would eventually take the  bag inside and there would be an explosion, and I wouldn't be able to  live with myself.\n\n\n No. I had to stay to keep the balance wheel stationary until\u2014until  what?\n\n\n A man in tan gabardine, wearing a police cap and badge, walked out of  the entrance to stand on the stone steps beside me while he put on a  pair of dark glasses. A member of the airport police detail. I could  tell him. I could take him down to the little red bag and explain the  whole thing. Then it would be his baby and I would be off on my own  business.\n\n\n But he moved on down the steps, nodded at the redcap, and started  across the street to the parking area. I could have called to him,  \"Hey, officer, let me tell you about a bomb in a little red bag.\" But  I didn't. I didn't because I caught a movement at the baggage claim  counter out of the side of my eye.\n\n\n The attendant had picked up the bag and was walking with it up the ramp  to the rear of the air terminal. Picking up my own suitcase, I went  inside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bag  on the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk. The  clerk nodded and moved the bag to the rear room.\n\n\n I could visualize the balance wheel once again rocking like crazy. How  many minutes\u2014or seconds\u2014were left? I was sweating when I moved to the  counter, and it wasn't because of the sunshine I'd been soaking in. I  had to get as close to the bag as I could if I was going to stop the  clock again.\n\n\n \"Can I help you?\" the clerk asked.\n\n\n \"No. I'm waiting for someone.\"\n\n\n I turned my back to him, put down my suitcase, leaned against the  counter and reached out for the wheel. I found I could reach the  device, but it was far away. When I tried to dampen it, the wheel  escaped my grasp.\n\n\n \"Do you have my suitcase?\"\n\n\n I blinked my eyes open and looked around. The blonde in the plane stood  there looking very fresh and bright and unconcerned. In her right hand  she had a green baggage claim check.\n\n\n The clerk took it, nodded, and in a moment brought out the overnight  case and set it on the scales. The girl thanked him, picked it up,  glanced at me indifferently, and then started for the entrance with it.\n\n\n \"Just a moment,\" I found myself saying, grabbing my bag and hurrying  after her. At her side and a little ahead of her, I said, \"Listen to me.\"\n\n\n She looked annoyed and increased her stride toward the door.\n\n\n \"It's a matter of life or death,\" I said. I wanted to wrest the bag  from her and hurl it out through the doorway into the street, but I  restrained myself.\n\n\n She stopped and stared. I noticed a short, fat man in a rumpled  suitcoat and unpressed pants staring, too. Ignoring him, I said,  \"Please put the bag down. Over there.\" I indicated a spot beside a  telephone booth where it would be out of the way.\n\n\n She didn't move. She just said, \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"For God's sake!\" I took the case. She offered no resistance. I put her  bag and mine next to the booth. When I turned around she was standing  there looking at me as if I had gone out of my mind. Her eyes were blue  and brown-flecked, very pretty eyes, and my thought at the moment was,  I'm glad the bomb didn't go off; these eyes wouldn't be looking at me  or anything else right now if it had.\n\n\n \"I've got to talk to you. It's very important.\"\n\n\n The girl said, \"Why?\" I was beginning to think it was the only word she  knew. At the same time I was wondering why anyone would want to kill  someone so lovely.\n\n\n \"I'll explain in a moment. Please stand right here while I make a  telephone call.\" I moved toward the phone booth, paused and said, \"And  don't ask me why.\"\n\n\n She gave me a speculative look.\n\n\n I must not have seemed a complete idiot because she said, \"All right,  but\u2014\"\n\n\n I didn't listen for the rest. I went into the booth, closed the door,  pretended to drop a coin and dial a number. But all the time I was in  there, I was reaching out through the glass for the clock. At this  range it wasn't difficult to stop the balance wheel.\n\n\n Just the same, when I came out I was wringing wet.\n\n\n \"Now will you please tell me what this is all about?\" she said stiffly.\n\n\n \"Gladly. Let me buy you a cup of coffee and I'll explain.\"\n\n\n She glanced at the bags. I told her they'd be all right. We followed  the short, fat man into the coffee shop.\n\n\n Over coffee I explained it all to her, how I had this extrasensory  ability, how she was the first person I had ever revealed it to, and  how I had discovered what was in her overnight bag.\n\n\n During the telling, her untouched coffee grew a skin, her face grew  pale, her eyes grew less curious and more troubled. There were tears  there when I finished. I asked her who put the bomb in her bag.\n\n\n \"Joe did,\" she said in a toneless voice, not looking at me any more but  staring vacantly across the room. \"Joe put it there.\" Behind her eyes  she was reliving some recent scene.\n\n\n \"Who is Joe?\"\n\n\n \"My husband.\" I thought she was going to really bawl, but she got  control again. \"This trip was his idea, my coming down here to visit my  sister.\" Her smile was bleak. \"I see now why he wanted to put in those  books. I'd finished packing and was in the bathroom. He said he'd put  in some books we'd both finished reading\u2014for my sister. That's when he  must have put the\u2014put it in there.\"\n\n\n I said gently, \"Why would he want to do a thing like that?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know.\" She shook her head. \"I just don't know.\" And she was  close to bawling again. Then she recovered and said, \"I'm not sure I  want to know.\" I admired her for saying it. Joe must have been crazy.\n\n\n \"It's all right now?\" she asked.\n\n\n I nodded. \"As long as we don't move it.\"\n\n\n I told her I didn't know how much more time there was, that I'd been  thinking it over and that the only way out seemed to be to tell the  airport policeman. After I explained it to her, the girl\u2014she said her  name was Julia Claremont\u2014agreed to tell him she thought there was a  bomb in her bag, that she had noticed a ticking and had become worried  because she knew she hadn't packed a clock. It wasn't good, but it  would have to do.\n\n\n \"We've got to get it deactivated,\" I said, watching the fat man pay for  his coffee and leave. \"The sooner the better.\" I finished my coffee in one gulp and went to pay the bill with her.  I asked her why she didn't claim the bag at the same time the other  people had. She said she had called her sister and the phone was busy  for a long while.\n\n\n \"She was supposed to meet me, and when she wasn't here, I got worried.  She said she isn't feeling well and asked me to take a cab.\" She smiled  a little. It was a bright, cheery thing. I had the feeling it was all  for me. \"That's where I was going when you caught up with me.\"\n\n\n It had become a very nice day. But the bottom dropped out of it again  when we reached the lobby.\n\n\n The two bags weren't there.\n\n\n I ran to the entrance and nearly collided with the redcap.\n\n\n \"See anybody go out of here with a little red bag and an old battered  suitcase?\"\n\n\n \"Bag? Suitcase?\" he mumbled. Then he became excited. \"Why, a man just  stepped out of here\u2014\" He turned to look down the street. \"That's him.\"\n\n\n The dumpy man I'd seen was walking off; Julia's bag in his right hand,  mine in his left. He seemed in no hurry.\n\n\n \"Hey!\" I shouted, starting toward him.\n\n\n The man turned, took one look at me, and started to run. He came  abreast an old gray, mud-spattered coupe, ran around, opened the door  and threw both bags into the rear seat as he got in.\n\n\n The car was a hundred feet away and gathering speed by the time I  reached where it had been parked. I watched it for a moment, then  walked back to the entranceway where Julia was standing with the  redcap, who said, \"That man steal them suitcases?\"\n\n\n \"That he did,\" I said.\n\n\n Just then the airport policeman started across the street from the  parking lot. Redcap said, \"Better tell him about it.\"\n\n\n The policeman was sympathetic and concerned. He said, \"We'd better get  over to the office.\"\n\n\n But we never left the spot because an explosion some blocks distant  shattered the air. Julia's hand grasped my arm. Hard.\n\n\n \"Jets,\" the redcap said, eying the sky.\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" the policeman said. \"Didn't sound much like a jet to  me.\"\n\n\n We stood there. I could visualize the wreckage of an old gray coupe  in the middle of a street, but I couldn't visualize the driver. That  was all right. I didn't want to see him. I didn't know what Julia was  thinking.\n\n\n She said, \"About those bags,\" and looked at me.\n\n\n The officer said, \"Yes, miss?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't care about mine. I didn't have much of anything in it.\"\n\n\n \"I feel the same way,\" I said. \"Would it be all right if we didn't  bother to report it?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" the policeman said, \"I can't make you report it.\"\n\n\n \"I'd rather not then,\" Julia said. She turned to me. \"I'd like some  air. Can't we walk a little?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I said.\n\n\n We started down the street, her arm in mine, as the air began to fill  with the distant sounds of sirens. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich is the best description of how Julia reacted to the narrator trying to take her bag?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She was unsettled because a strange man had approached her trying to take her things\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She was surprised enough by the request that she wasn't quite sure how to react\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She was surprised enough by the request that she wasn't quite sure how to react\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She was surprised enough by the request that she wasn't quite sure how to react\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
