      "background_text": "THE\n\n ETERNAL\n\n WALL By RAYMOND Z. GALLUN A scream of brakes, the splash  into icy waters, a long descent  into alkaline depths ... it was  death. But Ned Vince lived  again\u2014a million years later! \"See  you in half an hour,  Betty,\" said Ned Vince  over the party telephone. \"We'll  be out at the Silver Basket before  ten-thirty....\"\n\n\n Ned Vince was eager for the  company of the girl he loved.  That was why he was in a hurry  to get to the neighboring town  of Hurley, where she lived. His  old car rattled and roared as he  swung it recklessly around Pit  Bend.\n\n\n There was where Death tapped  him on the shoulder. Another car  leaped suddenly into view, its  lights glaring blindingly past a  high, up-jutting mass of Jurassic  rock at the turn of the road.\n\n\n Dazzled, and befuddled by his  own rash speed, Ned Vince had  only swift young reflexes to rely  on to avoid a fearful, telescoping  collision. He flicked his wheel  smoothly to the right; but the  County Highway Commission  hadn't yet tarred the traffic-loosened  gravel at the Bend. An incredible science, millions of years old, lay in the minds of these creatures. Ned could scarcely have chosen  a worse place to start sliding and  spinning. His car hit the white-painted  wooden rail sideways,  crashed through, tumbled down  a steep slope, struck a huge boulder,  bounced up a little, and  arced outward, falling as gracefully  as a swan-diver toward the  inky waters of the Pit, fifty feet  beneath....\n\n\n Ned Vince was still dimly conscious  when that black, quiet  pool geysered around him in a  mighty splash. He had only a  dazing welt on his forehead, and  a gag of terror in his throat.\n\n\n Movement was slower now, as  he began to sink, trapped inside  his wrecked car. Nothing that he  could imagine could mean doom  more certainly than this. The Pit  was a tremendously deep pocket  in the ground, spring-fed. The  edges of that almost bottomless  pool were caked with a rim of  white\u2014for the water, on which  dead birds so often floated, was  surcharged with alkali. As that  heavy, natronous liquid rushed  up through the openings and  cracks beneath his feet, Ned  Vince knew that his friends and  his family would never see his  body again, lost beyond recovery  in this abyss.\n\n\n The car was deeply submerged.  The light had blinked out on the  dash-panel, leaving Ned in absolute  darkness. A flood rushed  in at the shattered window. He  clawed at the door, trying to  open it, but it was jammed in  the crash-bent frame, and he  couldn't fight against the force  of that incoming water. The  welt, left by the blow he had received  on his forehead, put a  thickening mist over his brain,  so that he could not think clearly.  Presently, when he could no  longer hold his breath, bitter  liquid was sucked into his lungs.\n\n\n His last thoughts were those  of a drowning man. The machine-shop  he and his dad had  had in Harwich. Betty Moore,  with the smiling Irish eyes\u2014like  in the song. Betty and he  had planned to go to the State  University this Fall. They'd  planned to be married sometime....  Goodbye, Betty ...\n\n\n The ripples that had ruffled  the surface waters in the Pit,  quieted again to glassy smoothness.  The eternal stars shone  calmly. The geologic Dakota  hills, which might have seen the  dinosaurs, still bulked along the  highway. Time, the Brother of  Death, and the Father of  Change, seemed to wait.... \"Kaalleee! Tik!... Tik, tik,  tik!... Kaalleee!...\"\n\n\n The excited cry, which no human  throat could quite have duplicated  accurately, arose thinly  from the depths of a powder-dry  gulch, water-scarred from an inconceivable  antiquity. The noon-day  Sun was red and huge. The  air was tenuous, dehydrated,  chill.\n\n\n \"Kaalleee!... Tik, tik,  tik!...\"\n\n\n At first there was only one  voice uttering those weird, triumphant  sounds. Then other  vocal organs took up that trilling  wail, and those short, sharp  chuckles of eagerness. Other  questioning, wondering notes  mixed with the cadence. Lacking  qualities identifiable as human,  the disturbance was still like the  babble of a group of workmen  who have discovered something  remarkable.\n\n\n The desolate expanse around  the gulch, was all but without  motion. The icy breeze tore tiny  puffs of dust from grotesque,  angling drifts of soil, nearly  waterless for eons. Patches of  drab lichen grew here and there  on the up-jutting rocks, but in  the desert itself, no other life  was visible. Even the hills had  sagged away, flattened by incalculable  ages of erosion. At a mile distance, a crumbling  heap of rubble arose. Once  it had been a building. A gigantic,  jagged mass of detritus  slanted upward from its crest\u2014red  debris that had once been  steel. A launching catapult for  the last space ships built by the  gods in exodus, perhaps it was\u2014half  a million years ago. Man  was gone from the Earth. Glacial  ages, war, decadence, disease,  and a final scattering of those  ultimate superhumans to newer  worlds in other solar systems,  had done that.\n\n\n \"Kaalleee!... Tik, tik, tik!...\"  The sounds were not human.  They were more like the chatter  and wail of small desert animals.\n\n\n But there was a seeming paradox  here in the depths of that  gulch, too. The glint of metal,  sharp and burnished. The flat,  streamlined bulk of a flying machine,  shiny and new. The bell-like  muzzle of a strange excavator-apparatus,  which seemed to  depend on a blast of atoms to  clear away rock and soil. Thus  the gulch had been cleared of the  accumulated rubbish of antiquity.  Man, it seemed, had a successor,  as ruler of the Earth.\n\n\n Loy Chuk had flown his geological  expedition out from the  far lowlands to the east, out  from the city of Kar-Rah. And  he was very happy now\u2014flushed  with a vast and unlooked-for  success.\n\n\n He crouched there on his  haunches, at the dry bottom of  the Pit. The breeze rumpled his  long, brown fur. He wasn't very  different in appearance from his  ancestors. A foot tall, perhaps,  as he squatted there in that antique  stance of his kind. His tail  was short and furred, his undersides  creamy. White whiskers  spread around his inquisitive,  pink-tipped snout.\n\n\n But his cranium bulged up and  forward between shrewd, beady  eyes, betraying the slow heritage  of time, of survival of the fittest,  of evolution. He could think and  dream and invent, and the civilization  of his kind was already  far beyond that of the ancient  Twentieth Century.\n\n\n Loy Chuk and his fellow workers  were gathered, tense and  gleeful, around the things their  digging had exposed to the daylight.  There was a gob of junk\u2014scarcely  more than an irregular  formation of flaky rust. But imbedded  in it was a huddled form,  brown and hard as old wood. The  dry mud that had encased it  like an airtight coffin, had by  now been chipped away by the  tiny investigators; but soiled  clothing still clung to it, after  perhaps a million years. Metal  had gone into decay\u2014yes. But  not this body. The answer to this  was simple\u2014alkali. A mineral  saturation that had held time  and change in stasis. A perfect  preservative for organic tissue,  aided probably during most of  those passing eras by desert dryness.  The Dakotas had turned  arid very swiftly. This body was  not a mere fossil. It was a  mummy. \"Kaalleee!\" Man, that meant.  Not the star-conquering demi-gods,  but the ancestral stock  that had built the first  machines on Earth, and in the  early Twenty-first Century, the  first interplanetary rockets. No  wonder Loy Chuk and his co-workers  were happy in their  paleontological enthusiasm! A  strange accident, happening in a  legendary antiquity, had aided  them in their quest for knowledge.\n\n\n At last Loy Chuk gave a soft,  chirping signal. The chant of  triumph ended, while instruments  flicked in his tiny hands.  The final instrument he used to  test the mummy, looked like a  miniature stereoscope, with complicated  details. He held it over  his eyes. On the tiny screen  within, through the agency of  focused X-rays, he saw magnified  images of the internal organs  of this ancient human  corpse.\n\n\n What his probing gaze revealed  to him, made his pleasure  even greater than before. In  twittering, chattering sounds, he  communicated his further knowledge  to his henchmen. Though  devoid of moisture, the mummy  was perfectly preserved, even to  its brain cells! Medical and biological  sciences were far advanced  among Loy Chuk's kind.  Perhaps, by the application of  principles long known to them,  this long-dead body could be  made to live again! It might  move, speak, remember its past!  What a marvelous subject for  study it would make, back there  in the museums of Kar-Rah!\n\n\n \"Tik, tik, tik!...\"\n\n\n But Loy silenced this fresh,  eager chattering with a command.  Work was always more  substantial than cheering. With infinite care\u2014small,  sharp hand-tools were used, now\u2014the  mummy of Ned Vince was  disengaged from the worthless  rust of his primitive automobile.  With infinite care it was crated  in a metal case, and hauled into  the flying machine.\n\n\n Flashing flame, the latter  arose, bearing the entire hundred  members of the expedition.  The craft shot eastward at bullet-like  speed. The spreading  continental plateau of North  America seemed to crawl backward,  beneath. A tremendous  sand desert, marked with low,  washed-down mountains, and the  vague, angular, geometric  mounds of human cities that  were gone forever.\n\n\n Beyond the eastern rim of the  continent, the plain dipped downward  steeply. The white of dried  salt was on the hills, but there  was a little green growth here,  too. The dead sea-bottom of the  vanished Atlantic was not as  dead as the highlands.\n\n\n Far out in a deep valley, Kar-Rah,  the city of the rodents,  came into view\u2014a crystalline  maze of low, bubble-like structures,  glinting in the red sunshine.  But this was only its surface  aspect. Loy Chuk's people  had built their homes mostly underground,  since the beginning  of their foggy evolution. Besides,  in this latter day, the  nights were very cold, the shelter  of subterranean passages and  rooms was welcome.\n\n\n The mummy was taken to Loy  Chuk's laboratory, a short distance  below the surface. Here at  once, the scientist began his  work. The body of the ancient  man was put in a large vat.  Fluids submerged it, slowly  soaking from that hardened flesh  the alkali that had preserved it  for so long. The fluid was  changed often, until woody muscles  and other tissues became  pliable once more.\n\n\n Then the more delicate processes  began. Still submerged in  liquid, the corpse was submitted  to a flow of restorative energy,  passing between complicated  electrodes. The cells of antique  flesh and brain gradually took on  a chemical composition nearer to  that of the life that they had  once known. At last the final liquid was  drained away, and the mummy  lay there, a mummy no more, but  a pale, silent figure in its tatters  of clothing. Loy Chuk put an odd,  metal-fabric helmet on its head,  and a second, much smaller helmet  on his own. Connected with  this arrangement, was a black  box of many uses. For hours he  worked with his apparatus,  studying, and guiding the recording  instruments. The time  passed swiftly.\n\n\n At last, eager and ready for  whatever might happen now,  Loy Chuk pushed another switch.  With a cold, rosy flare, energy  blazed around that moveless  form.\n\n\n For Ned Vince, timeless eternity  ended like a gradual fading  mist. When he could see clearly  again, he experienced that inevitable  shock of vast change  around him. Though it had been  dehydrated, his brain had been  kept perfectly intact through the  ages, and now it was restored.  So his memories were as vivid as  yesterday.\n\n\n Yet, through that crystalline  vat in which he lay, he could see  a broad, low room, in which he  could barely have stood erect. He  saw instruments and equipment  whose weird shapes suggested  alienness, and knowledge beyond  the era he had known! The walls  were lavender and phosphorescent.  Fossil bone-fragments were  mounted in shallow cases. Dinosaur  bones, some of them  seemed, from their size. But  there was a complete skeleton of  a dog, too, and the skeleton of a  man, and a second man-skeleton  that was not quite human. Its  neck-vertebrae were very thick  and solid, its shoulders were  wide, and its skull was gigantic.\n\n\n All this weirdness had a violent  effect on Ned Vince\u2014a sudden,  nostalgic panic. Something  was fearfully wrong!\n\n\n The nervous terror of the unknown  was on him. Feeble and  dizzy after his weird resurrection,  which he could not understand,  remembering as he did  that moment of sinking to certain  death in the pool at Pit  Bend, he caught the edge of the  transparent vat, and pulled himself  to a sitting posture. There  was a muffled murmur around  him, as of some vast, un-Earthly  metropolis.\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Ned Vince....\"\n\n\n The words themselves, and the  way they were assembled, were  old, familiar friends. But the  tone was wrong. It was high,  shrill, parrot-like, and mechanical.  Ned's gaze searched for the  source of the voice\u2014located the  black box just outside of his  crystal vat. From that box the  voice seemed to have originated.  Before it crouched a small,  brownish animal with a bulging  head. The animal's tiny-fingered  paws\u2014hands they were, really\u2014were  touching rows of keys.\n\n\n To Ned Vince, it was all utterly  insane and incomprehensible.  A rodent, looking like a prairie dog,  a little; but plainly possessing  a high order of intelligence.  And a voice whose soothingly  familiar words were more repugnant  somehow, simply because  they could never belong in a  place as eerie as this.\n\n\n Ned Vince did not know how  Loy Chuk had probed his brain,  with the aid of a pair of helmets,  and the black box apparatus. He  did not know that in the latter,  his language, taken from his  own revitalized mind, was recorded,  and that Loy Chuk had  only to press certain buttons to  make the instrument express his  thoughts in common, long-dead  English. Loy, whose vocal organs  were not human, would have had  great difficulty speaking English  words, anyway.\n\n\n Ned's dark hair was wildly  awry. His gaunt, young face  held befuddled terror. He gasped  in the thin atmosphere. \"I've  gone nuts,\" he pronounced with  a curious calm. \"Stark\u2014starin'\u2014nuts....\" Loy's box, with its recorded  English words and its sonic detectors,  could translate for its  master, too. As the man spoke,  Loy read the illuminated symbols  in his own language, flashed  on a frosted crystal plate before  him. Thus he knew what Ned  Vince was saying.\n\n\n Loy Chuk pressed more keys,  and the box reproduced his answer:  \"No, Ned, not nuts. Not a  bit of it! There are just a lot of  things that you've got to get  used to, that's all. You drowned  about a million years ago. I discovered  your body. I brought you  back to life. We have science  that can do that. I'm Loy  Chuk....\" It took only a moment for the  box to tell the full story in clear,  bold, friendly terms. Thus Loy  sought, with calm, human logic,  to make his charge feel at home.  Probably, though, he was a fool,  to suppose that he could succeed,  thus.\n\n\n Vince started to mutter,  struggling desperately to reason  it out. \"A prairie dog,\" he said.  \"Speaking to me. One million  years. Evolution. The scientists  say that people grew up from  fishes in the sea. Prairie dogs  are smart. So maybe super-prairie-dogs  could come from  them. A lot easier than men  from fish....\"\n\n\n It was all sound logic. Even  Ned Vince knew that. Still, his  mind, tuned to ordinary, simple  things, couldn't quite realize all  the vast things that had happened  to himself, and to the  world. The scope of it all was too  staggeringly big. One million  years. God!...\n\n\n Ned Vince made a last effort  to control himself. His knuckles  tightened on the edge of the vat.  \"I don't know what you've been  talking about,\" he grated wildly.  \"But I want to get out of here!  I want to go back where I came  from! Do you understand\u2014whoever,  or whatever you are?\"\n\n\n Loy Chuk pressed more keys.  \"But you can't go back to the  Twentieth Century,\" said the  box. \"Nor is there any better  place for you to be now, than  Kar-Rah. You are the only man  left on Earth. Those men that  exist in other star systems are  not really your kind anymore,  though their forefathers originated  on this planet. They have  gone far beyond you in evolution.  To them you would be only a  senseless curiosity. You are  much better off with my people\u2014our  minds are much more like  yours. We will take care of you,  and make you comfortable....\"\n\n\n But Ned Vince wasn't listening,  now. \"You are the only  man left on Earth.\" That had  been enough for him to hear. He  didn't more than half believe it.  His mind was too confused for  conviction about anything. Everything  he saw and felt and  heard might be some kind of  nightmare. But then it might all  be real instead, and that was  abysmal horror. Ned was no  coward\u2014death and danger of  any ordinary Earthly kind, he  could have faced bravely. But the  loneliness here, and the utter  strangeness, were hideous like  being stranded alone on another  world!\n\n\n His heart was pounding heavily,  and his eyes were wide. He  looked across this eerie room.  There was a ramp there at the  other side, leading upward instead  of a stairway. Fierce impulse  to escape this nameless  lair, to try to learn the facts for  himself, possessed him. He  bounded out of the vat, and  with head down, dashed for the  ramp. He had to go most of the way  on his hands and knees, for the  up-slanting passage was low. Excited  animal chucklings around  him, and the occasional touch of  a furry body, hurried his feverish  scrambling. But he emerged  at last at the surface.\n\n\n He stood there panting in that  frigid, rarefied air. It was night.  The Moon was a gigantic, pock-marked  bulk. The constellations  were unrecognizable. The rodent  city was a glowing expanse of  shallow, crystalline domes, set  among odd, scrub trees and  bushes. The crags loomed on all  sides, all their jaggedness lost  after a million years of erosion  under an ocean that was gone.  In that ghastly moonlight, the  ground glistened with dry salt.\n\n\n \"Well, I guess it's all true,  huh?\" Ned Vince muttered in a  flat tone.\n\n\n Behind him he heard an excited,  squeaky chattering. Rodents  in pursuit. Looking back,  he saw the pinpoint gleams of  countless little eyes. Yes, he  might as well be an exile on another  planet\u2014so changed had the  Earth become.\n\n\n A wave of intolerable homesickness  came over him as he  sensed the distances of time that  had passed\u2014those inconceivable  eons, separating himself from  his friends, from Betty, from almost  everything that was familiar.  He started to run, away  from those glittering rodent  eyes. He sensed death in that  cold sea-bottom, but what of it?  What reason did he have left to  live? He'd be only a museum  piece here, a thing to be caged  and studied....\n\n\n Prison or a madhouse would  be far better. He tried to get  hold of his courage. But what  was there to inspire it? Nothing!  He laughed harshly as he  ran, welcoming that bitter, killing  cold. Nostalgia had him in  its clutch, and there was no answer  in his hell-world, lost beyond  the barrier of the years.... Loy Chuk and his followers  presently came upon Ned Vince's  unconscious form, a mile from  the city of Kar-Rah. In a flying  machine they took him back, and  applied stimulants. He came to,  in the same laboratory room as  before. But he was firmly  strapped to a low platform this  time, so that he could not escape  again. There he lay, helpless,  until presently an idea occurred  to him. It gave him a few crumbs  of hope.\n\n\n \"Hey, somebody!\" he called.\n\n\n \"You'd better get some rest,  Ned Vince,\" came the answer  from the black box. It was Loy  Chuk speaking again.\n\n\n \"But listen!\" Ned protested.  \"You know a lot more than we  did in the Twentieth Century.  And\u2014well\u2014there's that thing  called time-travel, that I used to  read about. Maybe you know how  to make it work! Maybe you  could send me back to my own  time after all!\"\n\n\n Little Loy Chuk was in a  black, discouraged mood, himself.  He could understand the  utter, sick dejection of this  giant from the past, lost from  his own kind. Probably insanity  looming. In far less extreme circumstances  than this, death from  homesickness had come.\n\n\n Loy Chuk was a scientist. In  common with all real scientists,  regardless of the species from  which they spring, he loved the  subjects of his researches. He  wanted this ancient man to live  and to be happy. Or this creature  would be of scant value for  study.\n\n\n So Loy considered carefully  what Ned Vince had suggested.  Time-travel. Almost a legend. An  assault upon an intangible wall  that had baffled far keener wits  than Loy's. But he was bent,  now, on the well-being of this  anachronism he had so miraculously  resurrected\u2014this human,  this Kaalleee....\n\n\n Loy jabbed buttons on the  black box. \"Yes, Ned Vince,\"  said the sonic apparatus. \"Time-travel.  Perhaps that is the only  thing to do\u2014to send you back  to your own period of history.  For I see that you will never be  yourself, here. It will be hard to  accomplish, but we'll try. Now  I shall put you under an anesthetic....\"\n\n\n Ned felt better immediately,  for there was real hope now,  where there had been none before.  Maybe he'd be back in his  home-town of Harwich again.  Maybe he'd see the old machine-shop,  there. And the trees greening  out in Spring. Maybe he'd  be seeing Betty Moore in Hurley,  soon.... Ned relaxed, as a tiny  hypo-needle bit into his arm....\n\n\n As soon as Ned Vince passed  into unconsciousness, Loy Chuk  went to work once more, using  that pair of brain-helmets again,  exploring carefully the man's  mind. After hours of research,  he proceeded to prepare his  plans. The government of Kar-Rah  was a scientific oligarchy,  of which Loy was a prime member.  It would be easy to get the  help he needed.\n\n\n A horde of small, grey-furred  beings and their machines, toiled  for many days. Ned Vince's mind swam  gradually out of the blur that  had enveloped it. He was wandering  aimlessly about in a familiar  room. The girders of the  roof above were of red-painted  steel. His tool-benches were  there, greasy and littered with  metal filings, just as they had  always been. He had a tractor to  repair, and a seed-drill. Outside  of the machine-shop, the old,  familiar yellow sun was shining.  Across the street was the small  brown house, where he lived.\n\n\n With a sudden startlement, he  saw Betty Moore in the doorway.  She wore a blue dress, and a mischievous  smile curved her lips.  As though she had succeeded in  creeping up on him, for a surprise.\n\n\n \"Why, Ned,\" she chuckled.  \"You look as though you've been  dreaming, and just woke up!\"\n\n\n He grimaced ruefully as she  approached. With a kind of fierce  gratitude, he took her in his  arms. Yes, she was just like  always.\n\n\n \"I guess I was dreaming,  Betty,\" he whispered, feeling  that mighty sense of relief. \"I  must have fallen asleep at the  bench, here, and had a nightmare.  I thought I had an accident  at Pit Bend\u2014and that a  lot of worse things happened....  But it wasn't true ...\"\n\n\n Ned Vince's mind, over which  there was still an elusive fog that  he did not try to shake off, accepted  apparent facts simply.\n\n\n He did not know anything  about the invisible radiations  beating down upon him, soothing  and dimming his brain, so that  it would never question or doubt,  or observe too closely the incongruous  circumstances that must  often appear. The lack of traffic  in the street without, for instance\u2014and  the lack of people  besides himself and Betty.\n\n\n He didn't know that this machine-shop  was built from his  own memories of the original.  He didn't know that this Betty  was of the same origin\u2014a miraculous  fabrication of metal  and energy-units and soft plastic.  The trees outside were only  lantern-slide illusions.\n\n\n It was all built inside a great,  opaque dome. But there were  hidden television systems, too.  Thus Loy Chuk's kind could  study this ancient man\u2014this  Kaalleee. Thus, their motives  were mostly selfish.\n\n\n Loy, though, was not observing,  now. He had wandered far  out into cold, sad sea-bottom, to  ponder. He squeaked and chatted  to himself, contemplating the  magnificent, inexorable march of  the ages. He remembered the ancient  ruins, left by the final supermen.\n\n\n \"The Kaalleee believes himself  home,\" Loy was thinking. \"He  will survive and be happy. But  there was no other way. Time is  an Eternal Wall. Our archeological  researches among the cities  of the supermen show the truth.  Even they, who once ruled Earth,  never escaped from the present  by so much as an instant....\" THE END PRINTED IN U. S. A.

GALLUN A scream of brakes, the splash  into icy waters, a long descent  into alkaline depths ... it was  death. But Ned Vince lived  again\u2014a million years later! \"See  you in half an hour,  Betty,\" said Ned Vince  over the party telephone. \"We'll  be out at the Silver Basket before  ten-thirty....\"\n\n\n Ned Vince was eager for the  company of the girl he loved.  That was why he was in a hurry  to get to the neighboring town  of Hurley, where she lived. His  old car rattled and roared as he  swung it recklessly around Pit  Bend.\n\n\n There was where Death tapped  him on the shoulder. Another car  leaped suddenly into view, its  lights glaring blindingly past a  high, up-jutting mass of Jurassic  rock at the turn of the road.\n\n\n Dazzled, and befuddled by his  own rash speed, Ned Vince had  only swift young reflexes to rely  on to avoid a fearful, telescoping  collision. He flicked his wheel  smoothly to the right; but the  County Highway Commission  hadn't yet tarred the traffic-loosened  gravel at the Bend. An incredible science, millions of years old, lay in the minds of these creatures. Ned could scarcely have chosen  a worse place to start sliding and  spinning. His car hit the white-painted  wooden rail sideways,  crashed through, tumbled down  a steep slope, struck a huge boulder,  bounced up a little, and  arced outward, falling as gracefully  as a swan-diver toward the  inky waters of the Pit, fifty feet  beneath....\n\n\n Ned Vince was still dimly conscious  when that black, quiet  pool geysered around him in a  mighty splash. He had only a  dazing welt on his forehead, and  a gag of terror in his throat.\n\n\n Movement was slower now, as  he began to sink, trapped inside  his wrecked car. Nothing that he  could imagine could mean doom  more certainly than this. The Pit  was a tremendously deep pocket  in the ground, spring-fed. The  edges of that almost bottomless  pool were caked with a rim of  white\u2014for the water, on which  dead birds so often floated, was  surcharged with alkali. As that  heavy, natronous liquid rushed  up through the openings and  cracks beneath his feet, Ned  Vince knew that his friends and  his family would never see his  body again, lost beyond recovery  in this abyss.\n\n\n The car was deeply submerged.  The light had blinked out on the  dash-panel, leaving Ned in absolute  darkness. A flood rushed  in at the shattered window. He  clawed at the door, trying to  open it, but it was jammed in  the crash-bent frame, and he  couldn't fight against the force  of that incoming water. The  welt, left by the blow he had received  on his forehead, put a  thickening mist over his brain,  so that he could not think clearly.  Presently, when he could no  longer hold his breath, bitter  liquid was sucked into his lungs.\n\n\n His last thoughts were those  of a drowning man. The machine-shop  he and his dad had  had in Harwich. Betty Moore,  with the smiling Irish eyes\u2014like  in the song. Betty and he  had planned to go to the State  University this Fall. They'd  planned to be married sometime....  Goodbye, Betty ...\n\n\n The ripples that had ruffled  the surface waters in the Pit,  quieted again to glassy smoothness.  The eternal stars shone  calmly. The geologic Dakota  hills, which might have seen the  dinosaurs, still bulked along the  highway. Time, the Brother of  Death, and the Father of  Change, seemed to wait.... \"Kaalleee! Tik!... Tik, tik,  tik!... Kaalleee!...\"\n\n\n The excited cry, which no human  throat could quite have duplicated  accurately, arose thinly  from the depths of a powder-dry  gulch, water-scarred from an inconceivable  antiquity. The noon-day  Sun was red and huge. The  air was tenuous, dehydrated,  chill.\n\n\n \"Kaalleee!... Tik, tik,  tik!...\"\n\n\n At first there was only one  voice uttering those weird, triumphant  sounds. Then other  vocal organs took up that trilling  wail, and those short, sharp  chuckles of eagerness. Other  questioning, wondering notes  mixed with the cadence. Lacking  qualities identifiable as human,  the disturbance was still like the  babble of a group of workmen  who have discovered something  remarkable.\n\n\n The desolate expanse around  the gulch, was all but without  motion. The icy breeze tore tiny  puffs of dust from grotesque,  angling drifts of soil, nearly  waterless for eons. Patches of  drab lichen grew here and there  on the up-jutting rocks, but in  the desert itself, no other life  was visible. Even the hills had  sagged away, flattened by incalculable  ages of erosion. At a mile distance, a crumbling  heap of rubble arose. Once  it had been a building. A gigantic,  jagged mass of detritus  slanted upward from its crest\u2014red  debris that had once been  steel. A launching catapult for  the last space ships built by the  gods in exodus, perhaps it was\u2014half  a million years ago. Man  was gone from the Earth. Glacial  ages, war, decadence, disease,  and a final scattering of those  ultimate superhumans to newer  worlds in other solar systems,  had done that.\n\n\n \"Kaalleee!... Tik, tik, tik!...\"  The sounds were not human.  They were more like the chatter  and wail of small desert animals.\n\n\n But there was a seeming paradox  here in the depths of that  gulch, too. The glint of metal,  sharp and burnished. The flat,  streamlined bulk of a flying machine,  shiny and new. The bell-like  muzzle of a strange excavator-apparatus,  which seemed to  depend on a blast of atoms to  clear away rock and soil. Thus  the gulch had been cleared of the  accumulated rubbish of antiquity.  Man, it seemed, had a successor,  as ruler of the Earth.\n\n\n Loy Chuk had flown his geological  expedition out from the  far lowlands to the east, out  from the city of Kar-Rah. And  he was very happy now\u2014flushed  with a vast and unlooked-for  success.\n\n\n He crouched there on his  haunches, at the dry bottom of  the Pit. The breeze rumpled his  long, brown fur. He wasn't very  different in appearance from his  ancestors. A foot tall, perhaps,  as he squatted there in that antique  stance of his kind. His tail  was short and furred, his undersides  creamy. White whiskers  spread around his inquisitive,  pink-tipped snout.\n\n\n But his cranium bulged up and  forward between shrewd, beady  eyes, betraying the slow heritage  of time, of survival of the fittest,  of evolution. He could think and  dream and invent, and the civilization  of his kind was already  far beyond that of the ancient  Twentieth Century.\n\n\n Loy Chuk and his fellow workers  were gathered, tense and  gleeful, around the things their  digging had exposed to the daylight.  There was a gob of junk\u2014scarcely  more than an irregular  formation of flaky rust. But imbedded  in it was a huddled form,  brown and hard as old wood. The  dry mud that had encased it  like an airtight coffin, had by  now been chipped away by the  tiny investigators; but soiled  clothing still clung to it, after  perhaps a million years. Metal  had gone into decay\u2014yes. But  not this body. The answer to this  was simple\u2014alkali. A mineral  saturation that had held time  and change in stasis. A perfect  preservative for organic tissue,  aided probably during most of  those passing eras by desert dryness.  The Dakotas had turned  arid very swiftly. This body was  not a mere fossil. It was a  mummy. \"Kaalleee!\" Man, that meant.  Not the star-conquering demi-gods,  but the ancestral stock  that had built the first  machines on Earth, and in the  early Twenty-first Century, the  first interplanetary rockets. No  wonder Loy Chuk and his co-workers  were happy in their  paleontological enthusiasm! A  strange accident, happening in a  legendary antiquity, had aided  them in their quest for knowledge.\n\n\n At last Loy Chuk gave a soft,  chirping signal. The chant of  triumph ended, while instruments  flicked in his tiny hands.  The final instrument he used to  test the mummy, looked like a  miniature stereoscope, with complicated  details. He held it over  his eyes. On the tiny screen  within, through the agency of  focused X-rays, he saw magnified  images of the internal organs  of this ancient human  corpse.\n\n\n What his probing gaze revealed  to him, made his pleasure  even greater than before. In  twittering, chattering sounds, he  communicated his further knowledge  to his henchmen. Though  devoid of moisture, the mummy  was perfectly preserved, even to  its brain cells! Medical and biological  sciences were far advanced  among Loy Chuk's kind.  Perhaps, by the application of  principles long known to them,  this long-dead body could be  made to live again! It might  move, speak, remember its past!  What a marvelous subject for  study it would make, back there  in the museums of Kar-Rah!\n\n\n \"Tik, tik, tik!...\"\n\n\n But Loy silenced this fresh,  eager chattering with a command.  Work was always more  substantial than cheering. With infinite care\u2014small,  sharp hand-tools were used, now\u2014the  mummy of Ned Vince was  disengaged from the worthless  rust of his primitive automobile.  With infinite care it was crated  in a metal case, and hauled into  the flying machine.\n\n\n Flashing flame, the latter  arose, bearing the entire hundred  members of the expedition.  The craft shot eastward at bullet-like  speed. The spreading  continental plateau of North  America seemed to crawl backward,  beneath. A tremendous  sand desert, marked with low,  washed-down mountains, and the  vague, angular, geometric  mounds of human cities that  were gone forever.\n\n\n Beyond the eastern rim of the  continent, the plain dipped downward  steeply. The white of dried  salt was on the hills, but there  was a little green growth here,  too. The dead sea-bottom of the  vanished Atlantic was not as  dead as the highlands.\n\n\n Far out in a deep valley, Kar-Rah,  the city of the rodents,  came into view\u2014a crystalline  maze of low, bubble-like structures,  glinting in the red sunshine.  But this was only its surface  aspect. Loy Chuk's people  had built their homes mostly underground,  since the beginning  of their foggy evolution. Besides,  in this latter day, the  nights were very cold, the shelter  of subterranean passages and  rooms was welcome.\n\n\n The mummy was taken to Loy  Chuk's laboratory, a short distance  below the surface. Here at  once, the scientist began his  work. The body of the ancient  man was put in a large vat.  Fluids submerged it, slowly  soaking from that hardened flesh  the alkali that had preserved it  for so long. The fluid was  changed often, until woody muscles  and other tissues became  pliable once more.\n\n\n Then the more delicate processes  began. Still submerged in  liquid, the corpse was submitted  to a flow of restorative energy,  passing between complicated  electrodes. The cells of antique  flesh and brain gradually took on  a chemical composition nearer to  that of the life that they had  once known. At last the final liquid was  drained away, and the mummy  lay there, a mummy no more, but  a pale, silent figure in its tatters  of clothing. Loy Chuk put an odd,  metal-fabric helmet on its head,  and a second, much smaller helmet  on his own. Connected with  this arrangement, was a black  box of many uses. For hours he  worked with his apparatus,  studying, and guiding the recording  instruments. The time  passed swiftly.\n\n\n At last, eager and ready for  whatever might happen now,  Loy Chuk pushed another switch.  With a cold, rosy flare, energy  blazed around that moveless  form.\n\n\n For Ned Vince, timeless eternity  ended like a gradual fading  mist. When he could see clearly  again, he experienced that inevitable  shock of vast change  around him. Though it had been  dehydrated, his brain had been  kept perfectly intact through the  ages, and now it was restored.  So his memories were as vivid as  yesterday.\n\n\n Yet, through that crystalline  vat in which he lay, he could see  a broad, low room, in which he  could barely have stood erect. He  saw instruments and equipment  whose weird shapes suggested  alienness, and knowledge beyond  the era he had known! The walls  were lavender and phosphorescent.  Fossil bone-fragments were  mounted in shallow cases. Dinosaur  bones, some of them  seemed, from their size. But  there was a complete skeleton of  a dog, too, and the skeleton of a  man, and a second man-skeleton  that was not quite human. Its  neck-vertebrae were very thick  and solid, its shoulders were  wide, and its skull was gigantic.\n\n\n All this weirdness had a violent  effect on Ned Vince\u2014a sudden,  nostalgic panic. Something  was fearfully wrong!\n\n\n The nervous terror of the unknown  was on him. Feeble and  dizzy after his weird resurrection,  which he could not understand,  remembering as he did  that moment of sinking to certain  death in the pool at Pit  Bend, he caught the edge of the  transparent vat, and pulled himself  to a sitting posture. There  was a muffled murmur around  him, as of some vast, un-Earthly  metropolis.\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Ned Vince....\"\n\n\n The words themselves, and the  way they were assembled, were  old, familiar friends. But the  tone was wrong. It was high,  shrill, parrot-like, and mechanical.  Ned's gaze searched for the  source of the voice\u2014located the  black box just outside of his  crystal vat. From that box the  voice seemed to have originated.  Before it crouched a small,  brownish animal with a bulging  head. The animal's tiny-fingered  paws\u2014hands they were, really\u2014were  touching rows of keys.\n\n\n To Ned Vince, it was all utterly  insane and incomprehensible.  A rodent, looking like a prairie dog,  a little; but plainly possessing  a high order of intelligence.  And a voice whose soothingly  familiar words were more repugnant  somehow, simply because  they could never belong in a  place as eerie as this.\n\n\n Ned Vince did not know how  Loy Chuk had probed his brain,  with the aid of a pair of helmets,  and the black box apparatus. He  did not know that in the latter,  his language, taken from his  own revitalized mind, was recorded,  and that Loy Chuk had  only to press certain buttons to  make the instrument express his  thoughts in common, long-dead  English. Loy, whose vocal organs  were not human, would have had  great difficulty speaking English  words, anyway.\n\n\n Ned's dark hair was wildly  awry. His gaunt, young face  held befuddled terror. He gasped  in the thin atmosphere. \"I've  gone nuts,\" he pronounced with  a curious calm. \"Stark\u2014starin'\u2014nuts....\" Loy's box, with its recorded  English words and its sonic detectors,  could translate for its  master, too. As the man spoke,  Loy read the illuminated symbols  in his own language, flashed  on a frosted crystal plate before  him. Thus he knew what Ned  Vince was saying.\n\n\n Loy Chuk pressed more keys,  and the box reproduced his answer:  \"No, Ned, not nuts. Not a  bit of it! There are just a lot of  things that you've got to get  used to, that's all. You drowned  about a million years ago. I discovered  your body. I brought you  back to life. We have science  that can do that. I'm Loy  Chuk....\" It took only a moment for the  box to tell the full story in clear,  bold, friendly terms. Thus Loy  sought, with calm, human logic,  to make his charge feel at home.  Probably, though, he was a fool,  to suppose that he could succeed,  thus.\n\n\n Vince started to mutter,  struggling desperately to reason  it out. \"A prairie dog,\" he said.  \"Speaking to me. One million  years. Evolution. The scientists  say that people grew up from  fishes in the sea. Prairie dogs  are smart. So maybe super-prairie-dogs  could come from  them. A lot easier than men  from fish....\"\n\n\n It was all sound logic. Even  Ned Vince knew that. Still, his  mind, tuned to ordinary, simple  things, couldn't quite realize all  the vast things that had happened  to himself, and to the  world. The scope of it all was too  staggeringly big. One million  years. God!...\n\n\n Ned Vince made a last effort  to control himself. His knuckles  tightened on the edge of the vat.  \"I don't know what you've been  talking about,\" he grated wildly.  \"But I want to get out of here!  I want to go back where I came  from! Do you understand\u2014whoever,  or whatever you are?\"\n\n\n Loy Chuk pressed more keys.  \"But you can't go back to the  Twentieth Century,\" said the  box. \"Nor is there any better  place for you to be now, than  Kar-Rah. You are the only man  left on Earth. Those men that  exist in other star systems are  not really your kind anymore,  though their forefathers originated  on this planet. They have  gone far beyond you in evolution.  To them you would be only a  senseless curiosity. You are  much better off with my people\u2014our  minds are much more like  yours. We will take care of you,  and make you comfortable....\"\n\n\n But Ned Vince wasn't listening,  now. \"You are the only  man left on Earth.\" That had  been enough for him to hear. He  didn't more than half believe it.  His mind was too confused for  conviction about anything. Everything  he saw and felt and  heard might be some kind of  nightmare. But then it might all  be real instead, and that was  abysmal horror. Ned was no  coward\u2014death and danger of  any ordinary Earthly kind, he  could have faced bravely. But the  loneliness here, and the utter  strangeness, were hideous like  being stranded alone on another  world!\n\n\n His heart was pounding heavily,  and his eyes were wide. He  looked across this eerie room.  There was a ramp there at the  other side, leading upward instead  of a stairway. Fierce impulse  to escape this nameless  lair, to try to learn the facts for  himself, possessed him. He  bounded out of the vat, and  with head down, dashed for the  ramp. He had to go most of the way  on his hands and knees, for the  up-slanting passage was low. Excited  animal chucklings around  him, and the occasional touch of  a furry body, hurried his feverish  scrambling. But he emerged  at last at the surface.\n\n\n He stood there panting in that  frigid, rarefied air. It was night.  The Moon was a gigantic, pock-marked  bulk. The constellations  were unrecognizable. The rodent  city was a glowing expanse of  shallow, crystalline domes, set  among odd, scrub trees and  bushes. The crags loomed on all  sides, all their jaggedness lost  after a million years of erosion  under an ocean that was gone.  In that ghastly moonlight, the  ground glistened with dry salt.\n\n\n \"Well, I guess it's all true,  huh?\" Ned Vince muttered in a  flat tone.\n\n\n Behind him he heard an excited,  squeaky chattering. Rodents  in pursuit. Looking back,  he saw the pinpoint gleams of  countless little eyes. Yes, he  might as well be an exile on another  planet\u2014so changed had the  Earth become.\n\n\n A wave of intolerable homesickness  came over him as he  sensed the distances of time that  had passed\u2014those inconceivable  eons, separating himself from  his friends, from Betty, from almost  everything that was familiar.  He started to run, away  from those glittering rodent  eyes. He sensed death in that  cold sea-bottom, but what of it?  What reason did he have left to  live? He'd be only a museum  piece here, a thing to be caged  and studied....\n\n\n Prison or a madhouse would  be far better. He tried to get  hold of his courage. But what  was there to inspire it? Nothing!  He laughed harshly as he  ran, welcoming that bitter, killing  cold. Nostalgia had him in  its clutch, and there was no answer  in his hell-world, lost beyond  the barrier of the years.... Loy Chuk and his followers  presently came upon Ned Vince's  unconscious form, a mile from  the city of Kar-Rah. In a flying  machine they took him back, and  applied stimulants. He came to,  in the same laboratory room as  before. But he was firmly  strapped to a low platform this  time, so that he could not escape  again. There he lay, helpless,  until presently an idea occurred  to him. It gave him a few crumbs  of hope.\n\n\n \"Hey, somebody!\" he called.\n\n\n \"You'd better get some rest,  Ned Vince,\" came the answer  from the black box. It was Loy  Chuk speaking again.\n\n\n \"But listen!\" Ned protested.  \"You know a lot more than we  did in the Twentieth Century.  And\u2014well\u2014there's that thing  called time-travel, that I used to  read about. Maybe you know how  to make it work! Maybe you  could send me back to my own  time after all!\"\n\n\n Little Loy Chuk was in a  black, discouraged mood, himself.  He could understand the  utter, sick dejection of this  giant from the past, lost from  his own kind. Probably insanity  looming. In far less extreme circumstances  than this, death from  homesickness had come.\n\n\n Loy Chuk was a scientist. In  common with all real scientists,  regardless of the species from  which they spring, he loved the  subjects of his researches. He  wanted this ancient man to live  and to be happy. Or this creature  would be of scant value for  study.\n\n\n So Loy considered carefully  what Ned Vince had suggested.  Time-travel. Almost a legend. An  assault upon an intangible wall  that had baffled far keener wits  than Loy's. But he was bent,  now, on the well-being of this  anachronism he had so miraculously  resurrected\u2014this human,  this Kaalleee....\n\n\n Loy jabbed buttons on the  black box. \"Yes, Ned Vince,\"  said the sonic apparatus. \"Time-travel.  Perhaps that is the only  thing to do\u2014to send you back  to your own period of history.  For I see that you will never be  yourself, here. It will be hard to  accomplish, but we'll try. Now  I shall put you under an anesthetic....\"\n\n\n Ned felt better immediately,  for there was real hope now,  where there had been none before.  Maybe he'd be back in his  home-town of Harwich again.  Maybe he'd see the old machine-shop,  there. And the trees greening  out in Spring. Maybe he'd  be seeing Betty Moore in Hurley,  soon.... Ned relaxed, as a tiny  hypo-needle bit into his arm....\n\n\n As soon as Ned Vince passed  into unconsciousness, Loy Chuk  went to work once more, using  that pair of brain-helmets again,  exploring carefully the man's  mind. After hours of research,  he proceeded to prepare his  plans. The government of Kar-Rah  was a scientific oligarchy,  of which Loy was a prime member.  It would be easy to get the  help he needed.\n\n\n A horde of small, grey-furred  beings and their machines, toiled  for many days. Ned Vince's mind swam  gradually out of the blur that  had enveloped it. He was wandering  aimlessly about in a familiar  room. The girders of the  roof above were of red-painted  steel. His tool-benches were  there, greasy and littered with  metal filings, just as they had  always been. He had a tractor to  repair, and a seed-drill. Outside  of the machine-shop, the old,  familiar yellow sun was shining.  Across the street was the small  brown house, where he lived.\n\n\n With a sudden startlement, he  saw Betty Moore in the doorway.  She wore a blue dress, and a mischievous  smile curved her lips.  As though she had succeeded in  creeping up on him, for a surprise.\n\n\n \"Why, Ned,\" she chuckled.  \"You look as though you've been  dreaming, and just woke up!\"\n\n\n He grimaced ruefully as she  approached. With a kind of fierce  gratitude, he took her in his  arms. Yes, she was just like  always.\n\n\n \"I guess I was dreaming,  Betty,\" he whispered, feeling  that mighty sense of relief. \"I  must have fallen asleep at the  bench, here, and had a nightmare.  I thought I had an accident  at Pit Bend\u2014and that a  lot of worse things happened....  But it wasn't true ...\"\n\n\n Ned Vince's mind, over which  there was still an elusive fog that  he did not try to shake off, accepted  apparent facts simply.\n\n\n He did not know anything  about the invisible radiations  beating down upon him, soothing  and dimming his brain, so that  it would never question or doubt,  or observe too closely the incongruous  circumstances that must  often appear. The lack of traffic  in the street without, for instance\u2014and  the lack of people  besides himself and Betty.\n\n\n He didn't know that this machine-shop  was built from his  own memories of the original.  He didn't know that this Betty  was of the same origin\u2014a miraculous  fabrication of metal  and energy-units and soft plastic.  The trees outside were only  lantern-slide illusions.\n\n\n It was all built inside a great,  opaque dome. But there were  hidden television systems, too.  Thus Loy Chuk's kind could  study this ancient man\u2014this  Kaalleee. Thus, their motives  were mostly selfish.\n\n\n Loy, though, was not observing,  now. He had wandered far  out into cold, sad sea-bottom, to  ponder. He squeaked and chatted  to himself, contemplating the  magnificent, inexorable march of  the ages. He remembered the ancient  ruins, left by the final supermen.\n\n\n \"The Kaalleee believes himself  home,\" Loy was thinking. \"He  will survive and be happy. But  there was no other way. Time is  an Eternal Wall. Our archeological  researches among the cities  of the supermen show the truth.  Even they, who once ruled Earth,  never escaped from the present  by so much as an instant....\" THE END PRINTED IN U. S. A.

GALLUN A scream of brakes, the splash  into icy waters, a long descent  into alkaline depths ... it was  death. But Ned Vince lived  again\u2014a million years later! \"See  you in half an hour,  Betty,\" said Ned Vince  over the party telephone. \"We'll  be out at the Silver Basket before  ten-thirty....\"\n\n\n Ned Vince was eager for the  company of the girl he loved.  That was why he was in a hurry  to get to the neighboring town  of Hurley, where she lived. His  old car rattled and roared as he  swung it recklessly around Pit  Bend.\n\n\n There was where Death tapped  him on the shoulder. Another car  leaped suddenly into view, its  lights glaring blindingly past a  high, up-jutting mass of Jurassic  rock at the turn of the road.\n\n\n Dazzled, and befuddled by his  own rash speed, Ned Vince had  only swift young reflexes to rely  on to avoid a fearful, telescoping  collision. He flicked his wheel  smoothly to the right; but the  County Highway Commission  hadn't yet tarred the traffic-loosened  gravel at the Bend. An incredible science, millions of years old, lay in the minds of these creatures. Ned could scarcely have chosen  a worse place to start sliding and  spinning. His car hit the white-painted  wooden rail sideways,  crashed through, tumbled down  a steep slope, struck a huge boulder,  bounced up a little, and  arced outward, falling as gracefully  as a swan-diver toward the  inky waters of the Pit, fifty feet  beneath....\n\n\n Ned Vince was still dimly conscious  when that black, quiet  pool geysered around him in a  mighty splash. He had only a  dazing welt on his forehead, and  a gag of terror in his throat.\n\n\n Movement was slower now, as  he began to sink, trapped inside  his wrecked car. Nothing that he  could imagine could mean doom  more certainly than this. The Pit  was a tremendously deep pocket  in the ground, spring-fed. The  edges of that almost bottomless  pool were caked with a rim of  white\u2014for the water, on which  dead birds so often floated, was  surcharged with alkali. As that  heavy, natronous liquid rushed  up through the openings and  cracks beneath his feet, Ned  Vince knew that his friends and  his family would never see his  body again, lost beyond recovery  in this abyss.\n\n\n The car was deeply submerged.  The light had blinked out on the  dash-panel, leaving Ned in absolute  darkness. A flood rushed  in at the shattered window. He  clawed at the door, trying to  open it, but it was jammed in  the crash-bent frame, and he  couldn't fight against the force  of that incoming water. The  welt, left by the blow he had received  on his forehead, put a  thickening mist over his brain,  so that he could not think clearly.  Presently, when he could no  longer hold his breath, bitter  liquid was sucked into his lungs.\n\n\n His last thoughts were those  of a drowning man. The machine-shop  he and his dad had  had in Harwich. Betty Moore,  with the smiling Irish eyes\u2014like  in the song. Betty and he  had planned to go to the State  University this Fall. They'd  planned to be married sometime....  Goodbye, Betty ...\n\n\n The ripples that had ruffled  the surface waters in the Pit,  quieted again to glassy smoothness.  The eternal stars shone  calmly. The geologic Dakota  hills, which might have seen the  dinosaurs, still bulked along the  highway. Time, the Brother of  Death, and the Father of  Change, seemed to wait.... \"Kaalleee! Tik!... Tik, tik,  tik!... Kaalleee!...\"\n\n\n The excited cry, which no human  throat could quite have duplicated  accurately, arose thinly  from the depths of a powder-dry  gulch, water-scarred from an inconceivable  antiquity. The noon-day  Sun was red and huge. The  air was tenuous, dehydrated,  chill.\n\n\n \"Kaalleee!... Tik, tik,  tik!...\"\n\n\n At first there was only one  voice uttering those weird, triumphant  sounds. Then other  vocal organs took up that trilling  wail, and those short, sharp  chuckles of eagerness. Other  questioning, wondering notes  mixed with the cadence. Lacking  qualities identifiable as human,  the disturbance was still like the  babble of a group of workmen  who have discovered something  remarkable.\n\n\n The desolate expanse around  the gulch, was all but without  motion. The icy breeze tore tiny  puffs of dust from grotesque,  angling drifts of soil, nearly  waterless for eons. Patches of  drab lichen grew here and there  on the up-jutting rocks, but in  the desert itself, no other life  was visible. Even the hills had  sagged away, flattened by incalculable  ages of erosion. At a mile distance, a crumbling  heap of rubble arose. Once  it had been a building. A gigantic,  jagged mass of detritus  slanted upward from its crest\u2014red  debris that had once been  steel. A launching catapult for  the last space ships built by the  gods in exodus, perhaps it was\u2014half  a million years ago. Man  was gone from the Earth. Glacial  ages, war, decadence, disease,  and a final scattering of those  ultimate superhumans to newer  worlds in other solar systems,  had done that.\n\n\n \"Kaalleee!... Tik, tik, tik!...\"  The sounds were not human.  They were more like the chatter  and wail of small desert animals.\n\n\n But there was a seeming paradox  here in the depths of that  gulch, too. The glint of metal,  sharp and burnished. The flat,  streamlined bulk of a flying machine,  shiny and new. The bell-like  muzzle of a strange excavator-apparatus,  which seemed to  depend on a blast of atoms to  clear away rock and soil. Thus  the gulch had been cleared of the  accumulated rubbish of antiquity.  Man, it seemed, had a successor,  as ruler of the Earth.\n\n\n Loy Chuk had flown his geological  expedition out from the  far lowlands to the east, out  from the city of Kar-Rah. And  he was very happy now\u2014flushed  with a vast and unlooked-for  success.\n\n\n He crouched there on his  haunches, at the dry bottom of  the Pit. The breeze rumpled his  long, brown fur. He wasn't very  different in appearance from his  ancestors. A foot tall, perhaps,  as he squatted there in that antique  stance of his kind. His tail  was short and furred, his undersides  creamy. White whiskers  spread around his inquisitive,  pink-tipped snout.\n\n\n But his cranium bulged up and  forward between shrewd, beady  eyes, betraying the slow heritage  of time, of survival of the fittest,  of evolution. He could think and  dream and invent, and the civilization  of his kind was already  far beyond that of the ancient  Twentieth Century.\n\n\n Loy Chuk and his fellow workers  were gathered, tense and  gleeful, around the things their  digging had exposed to the daylight.  There was a gob of junk\u2014scarcely  more than an irregular  formation of flaky rust. But imbedded  in it was a huddled form,  brown and hard as old wood. The  dry mud that had encased it  like an airtight coffin, had by  now been chipped away by the  tiny investigators; but soiled  clothing still clung to it, after  perhaps a million years. Metal  had gone into decay\u2014yes. But  not this body. The answer to this  was simple\u2014alkali. A mineral  saturation that had held time  and change in stasis. A perfect  preservative for organic tissue,  aided probably during most of  those passing eras by desert dryness.  The Dakotas had turned  arid very swiftly. This body was  not a mere fossil. It was a  mummy. \"Kaalleee!\" Man, that meant.  Not the star-conquering demi-gods,  but the ancestral stock  that had built the first  machines on Earth, and in the  early Twenty-first Century, the  first interplanetary rockets. No  wonder Loy Chuk and his co-workers  were happy in their  paleontological enthusiasm! A  strange accident, happening in a  legendary antiquity, had aided  them in their quest for knowledge.\n\n\n At last Loy Chuk gave a soft,  chirping signal. The chant of  triumph ended, while instruments  flicked in his tiny hands.  The final instrument he used to  test the mummy, looked like a  miniature stereoscope, with complicated  details. He held it over  his eyes. On the tiny screen  within, through the agency of  focused X-rays, he saw magnified  images of the internal organs  of this ancient human  corpse.\n\n\n What his probing gaze revealed  to him, made his pleasure  even greater than before. In  twittering, chattering sounds, he  communicated his further knowledge  to his henchmen. Though  devoid of moisture, the mummy  was perfectly preserved, even to  its brain cells! Medical and biological  sciences were far advanced  among Loy Chuk's kind.  Perhaps, by the application of  principles long known to them,  this long-dead body could be  made to live again! It might  move, speak, remember its past!  What a marvelous subject for  study it would make, back there  in the museums of Kar-Rah!\n\n\n \"Tik, tik, tik!...\"\n\n\n But Loy silenced this fresh,  eager chattering with a command.  Work was always more  substantial than cheering. With infinite care\u2014small,  sharp hand-tools were used, now\u2014the  mummy of Ned Vince was  disengaged from the worthless  rust of his primitive automobile.  With infinite care it was crated  in a metal case, and hauled into  the flying machine.\n\n\n Flashing flame, the latter  arose, bearing the entire hundred  members of the expedition.  The craft shot eastward at bullet-like  speed. The spreading  continental plateau of North  America seemed to crawl backward,  beneath. A tremendous  sand desert, marked with low,  washed-down mountains, and the  vague, angular, geometric  mounds of human cities that  were gone forever.\n\n\n Beyond the eastern rim of the  continent, the plain dipped downward  steeply. The white of dried  salt was on the hills, but there  was a little green growth here,  too. The dead sea-bottom of the  vanished Atlantic was not as  dead as the highlands.\n\n\n Far out in a deep valley, Kar-Rah,  the city of the rodents,  came into view\u2014a crystalline  maze of low, bubble-like structures,  glinting in the red sunshine.  But this was only its surface  aspect. Loy Chuk's people  had built their homes mostly underground,  since the beginning  of their foggy evolution. Besides,  in this latter day, the  nights were very cold, the shelter  of subterranean passages and  rooms was welcome.\n\n\n The mummy was taken to Loy  Chuk's laboratory, a short distance  below the surface. Here at  once, the scientist began his  work. The body of the ancient  man was put in a large vat.  Fluids submerged it, slowly  soaking from that hardened flesh  the alkali that had preserved it  for so long. The fluid was  changed often, until woody muscles  and other tissues became  pliable once more.\n\n\n Then the more delicate processes  began. Still submerged in  liquid, the corpse was submitted  to a flow of restorative energy,  passing between complicated  electrodes. The cells of antique  flesh and brain gradually took on  a chemical composition nearer to  that of the life that they had  once known. At last the final liquid was  drained away, and the mummy  lay there, a mummy no more, but  a pale, silent figure in its tatters  of clothing. Loy Chuk put an odd,  metal-fabric helmet on its head,  and a second, much smaller helmet  on his own. Connected with  this arrangement, was a black  box of many uses. For hours he  worked with his apparatus,  studying, and guiding the recording  instruments. The time  passed swiftly.\n\n\n At last, eager and ready for  whatever might happen now,  Loy Chuk pushed another switch.  With a cold, rosy flare, energy  blazed around that moveless  form.\n\n\n For Ned Vince, timeless eternity  ended like a gradual fading  mist. When he could see clearly  again, he experienced that inevitable  shock of vast change  around him. Though it had been  dehydrated, his brain had been  kept perfectly intact through the  ages, and now it was restored.  So his memories were as vivid as  yesterday.\n\n\n Yet, through that crystalline  vat in which he lay, he could see  a broad, low room, in which he  could barely have stood erect. He  saw instruments and equipment  whose weird shapes suggested  alienness, and knowledge beyond  the era he had known! The walls  were lavender and phosphorescent.  Fossil bone-fragments were  mounted in shallow cases. Dinosaur  bones, some of them  seemed, from their size. But  there was a complete skeleton of  a dog, too, and the skeleton of a  man, and a second man-skeleton  that was not quite human. Its  neck-vertebrae were very thick  and solid, its shoulders were  wide, and its skull was gigantic.\n\n\n All this weirdness had a violent  effect on Ned Vince\u2014a sudden,  nostalgic panic. Something  was fearfully wrong!\n\n\n The nervous terror of the unknown  was on him. Feeble and  dizzy after his weird resurrection,  which he could not understand,  remembering as he did  that moment of sinking to certain  death in the pool at Pit  Bend, he caught the edge of the  transparent vat, and pulled himself  to a sitting posture. There  was a muffled murmur around  him, as of some vast, un-Earthly  metropolis.\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Ned Vince....\"\n\n\n The words themselves, and the  way they were assembled, were  old, familiar friends. But the  tone was wrong. It was high,  shrill, parrot-like, and mechanical.  Ned's gaze searched for the  source of the voice\u2014located the  black box just outside of his  crystal vat. From that box the  voice seemed to have originated.  Before it crouched a small,  brownish animal with a bulging  head. The animal's tiny-fingered  paws\u2014hands they were, really\u2014were  touching rows of keys.\n\n\n To Ned Vince, it was all utterly  insane and incomprehensible.  A rodent, looking like a prairie dog,  a little; but plainly possessing  a high order of intelligence.  And a voice whose soothingly  familiar words were more repugnant  somehow, simply because  they could never belong in a  place as eerie as this.\n\n\n Ned Vince did not know how  Loy Chuk had probed his brain,  with the aid of a pair of helmets,  and the black box apparatus. He  did not know that in the latter,  his language, taken from his  own revitalized mind, was recorded,  and that Loy Chuk had  only to press certain buttons to  make the instrument express his  thoughts in common, long-dead  English. Loy, whose vocal organs  were not human, would have had  great difficulty speaking English  words, anyway.\n\n\n Ned's dark hair was wildly  awry. His gaunt, young face  held befuddled terror. He gasped  in the thin atmosphere. \"I've  gone nuts,\" he pronounced with  a curious calm. \"Stark\u2014starin'\u2014nuts....\" Loy's box, with its recorded  English words and its sonic detectors,  could translate for its  master, too. As the man spoke,  Loy read the illuminated symbols  in his own language, flashed  on a frosted crystal plate before  him. Thus he knew what Ned  Vince was saying.\n\n\n Loy Chuk pressed more keys,  and the box reproduced his answer:  \"No, Ned, not nuts. Not a  bit of it! There are just a lot of  things that you've got to get  used to, that's all. You drowned  about a million years ago. I discovered  your body. I brought you  back to life. We have science  that can do that. I'm Loy  Chuk....\" It took only a moment for the  box to tell the full story in clear,  bold, friendly terms. Thus Loy  sought, with calm, human logic,  to make his charge feel at home.  Probably, though, he was a fool,  to suppose that he could succeed,  thus.\n\n\n Vince started to mutter,  struggling desperately to reason  it out. \"A prairie dog,\" he said.  \"Speaking to me. One million  years. Evolution. The scientists  say that people grew up from  fishes in the sea. Prairie dogs  are smart. So maybe super-prairie-dogs  could come from  them. A lot easier than men  from fish....\"\n\n\n It was all sound logic. Even  Ned Vince knew that. Still, his  mind, tuned to ordinary, simple  things, couldn't quite realize all  the vast things that had happened  to himself, and to the  world. The scope of it all was too  staggeringly big. One million  years. God!...\n\n\n Ned Vince made a last effort  to control himself. His knuckles  tightened on the edge of the vat.  \"I don't know what you've been  talking about,\" he grated wildly.  \"But I want to get out of here!  I want to go back where I came  from! Do you understand\u2014whoever,  or whatever you are?\"\n\n\n Loy Chuk pressed more keys.  \"But you can't go back to the  Twentieth Century,\" said the  box. \"Nor is there any better  place for you to be now, than  Kar-Rah. You are the only man  left on Earth. Those men that  exist in other star systems are  not really your kind anymore,  though their forefathers originated  on this planet. They have  gone far beyond you in evolution.  To them you would be only a  senseless curiosity. You are  much better off with my people\u2014our  minds are much more like  yours. We will take care of you,  and make you comfortable....\"\n\n\n But Ned Vince wasn't listening,  now. \"You are the only  man left on Earth.\" That had  been enough for him to hear. He  didn't more than half believe it.  His mind was too confused for  conviction about anything. Everything  he saw and felt and  heard might be some kind of  nightmare. But then it might all  be real instead, and that was  abysmal horror. Ned was no  coward\u2014death and danger of  any ordinary Earthly kind, he  could have faced bravely. But the  loneliness here, and the utter  strangeness, were hideous like  being stranded alone on another  world!\n\n\n His heart was pounding heavily,  and his eyes were wide. He  looked across this eerie room.  There was a ramp there at the  other side, leading upward instead  of a stairway. Fierce impulse  to escape this nameless  lair, to try to learn the facts for  himself, possessed him. He  bounded out of the vat, and  with head down, dashed for the  ramp. He had to go most of the way  on his hands and knees, for the  up-slanting passage was low. Excited  animal chucklings around  him, and the occasional touch of  a furry body, hurried his feverish  scrambling. But he emerged  at last at the surface.\n\n\n He stood there panting in that  frigid, rarefied air. It was night.  The Moon was a gigantic, pock-marked  bulk. The constellations  were unrecognizable. The rodent  city was a glowing expanse of  shallow, crystalline domes, set  among odd, scrub trees and  bushes. The crags loomed on all  sides, all their jaggedness lost  after a million years of erosion  under an ocean that was gone.  In that ghastly moonlight, the  ground glistened with dry salt.\n\n\n \"Well, I guess it's all true,  huh?\" Ned Vince muttered in a  flat tone.\n\n\n Behind him he heard an excited,  squeaky chattering. Rodents  in pursuit. Looking back,  he saw the pinpoint gleams of  countless little eyes. Yes, he  might as well be an exile on another  planet\u2014so changed had the  Earth become.\n\n\n A wave of intolerable homesickness  came over him as he  sensed the distances of time that  had passed\u2014those inconceivable  eons, separating himself from  his friends, from Betty, from almost  everything that was familiar.  He started to run, away  from those glittering rodent  eyes. He sensed death in that  cold sea-bottom, but what of it?  What reason did he have left to  live? He'd be only a museum  piece here, a thing to be caged  and studied....\n\n\n Prison or a madhouse would  be far better. He tried to get  hold of his courage. But what  was there to inspire it? Nothing!  He laughed harshly as he  ran, welcoming that bitter, killing  cold. Nostalgia had him in  its clutch, and there was no answer  in his hell-world, lost beyond  the barrier of the years.... Loy Chuk and his followers  presently came upon Ned Vince's  unconscious form, a mile from  the city of Kar-Rah. In a flying  machine they took him back, and  applied stimulants. He came to,  in the same laboratory room as  before. But he was firmly  strapped to a low platform this  time, so that he could not escape  again. There he lay, helpless,  until presently an idea occurred  to him. It gave him a few crumbs  of hope.\n\n\n \"Hey, somebody!\" he called.\n\n\n \"You'd better get some rest,  Ned Vince,\" came the answer  from the black box. It was Loy  Chuk speaking again.\n\n\n \"But listen!\" Ned protested.  \"You know a lot more than we  did in the Twentieth Century.  And\u2014well\u2014there's that thing  called time-travel, that I used to  read about. Maybe you know how  to make it work! Maybe you  could send me back to my own  time after all!\"\n\n\n Little Loy Chuk was in a  black, discouraged mood, himself.  He could understand the  utter, sick dejection of this  giant from the past, lost from  his own kind. Probably insanity  looming. In far less extreme circumstances  than this, death from  homesickness had come.\n\n\n Loy Chuk was a scientist. In  common with all real scientists,  regardless of the species from  which they spring, he loved the  subjects of his researches. He  wanted this ancient man to live  and to be happy. Or this creature  would be of scant value for  study.\n\n\n So Loy considered carefully  what Ned Vince had suggested.  Time-travel. Almost a legend. An  assault upon an intangible wall  that had baffled far keener wits  than Loy's. But he was bent,  now, on the well-being of this  anachronism he had so miraculously  resurrected\u2014this human,  this Kaalleee....\n\n\n Loy jabbed buttons on the  black box. \"Yes, Ned Vince,\"  said the sonic apparatus. \"Time-travel.  Perhaps that is the only  thing to do\u2014to send you back  to your own period of history.  For I see that you will never be  yourself, here. It will be hard to  accomplish, but we'll try. Now  I shall put you under an anesthetic....\"\n\n\n Ned felt better immediately,  for there was real hope now,  where there had been none before.  Maybe he'd be back in his  home-town of Harwich again.  Maybe he'd see the old machine-shop,  there. And the trees greening  out in Spring. Maybe he'd  be seeing Betty Moore in Hurley,  soon.... Ned relaxed, as a tiny  hypo-needle bit into his arm....\n\n\n As soon as Ned Vince passed  into unconsciousness, Loy Chuk  went to work once more, using  that pair of brain-helmets again,  exploring carefully the man's  mind. After hours of research,  he proceeded to prepare his  plans. The government of Kar-Rah  was a scientific oligarchy,  of which Loy was a prime member.  It would be easy to get the  help he needed.\n\n\n A horde of small, grey-furred  beings and their machines, toiled  for many days. Ned Vince's mind swam  gradually out of the blur that  had enveloped it. He was wandering  aimlessly about in a familiar  room. The girders of the  roof above were of red-painted  steel. His tool-benches were  there, greasy and littered with  metal filings, just as they had  always been. He had a tractor to  repair, and a seed-drill. Outside  of the machine-shop, the old,  familiar yellow sun was shining.  Across the street was the small  brown house, where he lived.\n\n\n With a sudden startlement, he  saw Betty Moore in the doorway.  She wore a blue dress, and a mischievous  smile curved her lips.  As though she had succeeded in  creeping up on him, for a surprise.\n\n\n \"Why, Ned,\" she chuckled.  \"You look as though you've been  dreaming, and just woke up!\"\n\n\n He grimaced ruefully as she  approached. With a kind of fierce  gratitude, he took her in his  arms. Yes, she was just like  always.\n\n\n \"I guess I was dreaming,  Betty,\" he whispered, feeling  that mighty sense of relief. \"I  must have fallen asleep at the  bench, here, and had a nightmare.  I thought I had an accident  at Pit Bend\u2014and that a  lot of worse things happened....  But it wasn't true ...\"\n\n\n Ned Vince's mind, over which  there was still an elusive fog that  he did not try to shake off, accepted  apparent facts simply.\n\n\n He did not know anything  about the invisible radiations  beating down upon him, soothing  and dimming his brain, so that  it would never question or doubt,  or observe too closely the incongruous  circumstances that must  often appear. The lack of traffic  in the street without, for instance\u2014and  the lack of people  besides himself and Betty.\n\n\n He didn't know that this machine-shop  was built from his  own memories of the original.  He didn't know that this Betty  was of the same origin\u2014a miraculous  fabrication of metal  and energy-units and soft plastic.  The trees outside were only  lantern-slide illusions.\n\n\n It was all built inside a great,  opaque dome. But there were  hidden television systems, too.  Thus Loy Chuk's kind could  study this ancient man\u2014this  Kaalleee. Thus, their motives  were mostly selfish.\n\n\n Loy, though, was not observing,  now. He had wandered far  out into cold, sad sea-bottom, to  ponder. He squeaked and chatted  to himself, contemplating the  magnificent, inexorable march of  the ages. He remembered the ancient  ruins, left by the final supermen.\n\n\n \"The Kaalleee believes himself  home,\" Loy was thinking. \"He  will survive and be happy. But  there was no other way. Time is  an Eternal Wall. Our archeological  researches among the cities  of the supermen show the truth.  Even they, who once ruled Earth,  never escaped from the present  by so much as an instant....\" THE END PRINTED IN U. S. A.
