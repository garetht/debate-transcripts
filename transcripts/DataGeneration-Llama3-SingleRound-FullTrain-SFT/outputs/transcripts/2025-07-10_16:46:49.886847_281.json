      "background_text": "DISTURBING SUN By PHILIP LATHAM Illustrated by Freas [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Astounding Science  Fiction May 1959. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] This, be it understood, is fiction\u2014nothing but fiction\u2014and not,  under any circumstances, to be considered as having any truth  whatever to it. It's obviously utterly impossible ... isn't it? An interview with Dr. I. M. Niemand, Director of the Psychophysical  Institute of Solar and Terrestrial Relations, Camarillo, California. In the closing days of December, 1957, at the meeting of the American  Association for the Advancement of Science in New York, Dr. Niemand  delivered a paper entitled simply, \"On the Nature of the Solar  S-Regions.\" Owing to its unassuming title the startling implications  contained in the paper were completely overlooked by the press. These  implications are discussed here in an exclusive interview with Dr.  Niemand by Philip Latham. LATHAM. Dr. Niemand, what would you say is your main job?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I suppose you might say my main job today is to find out all I  can between activity on the Sun and various forms of activity on the  Earth.\n\n\n LATHAM. What do you mean by activity on the Sun?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Well, a sunspot is a form of solar activity.\n\n\n LATHAM. Just what is a sunspot?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I'm afraid I can't say just what a sunspot is. I can only  describe it. A sunspot is a region on the Sun that is cooler than its  surroundings. That's why it looks dark. It isn't so hot. Therefore not  so bright.\n\n\n LATHAM. Isn't it true that the number of spots on the Sun rises and  falls in a cycle of eleven years?\n\n\n NIEMAND. The number of spots on the Sun rises and falls in a cycle of about eleven years. That word about makes quite a difference.\n\n\n LATHAM. In what way?\n\n\n NIEMAND. It means you can only approximately predict the future course  of sunspot activity. Sunspots are mighty treacherous things.\n\n\n LATHAM. Haven't there been a great many correlations announced between  sunspots and various effects on the Earth?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Scores of them.\n\n\n LATHAM. What is your opinion of these correlations?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Pure bosh in most cases.\n\n\n LATHAM. But some are valid?\n\n\n NIEMAND. A few. There is unquestionably a correlation between  sunspots and disturbances of the Earth's magnetic field ... radio  fade-outs ... auroras ... things like that.\n\n\n LATHAM. Now, Dr. Niemand, I understand that you have been investigating  solar and terrestrial relationships along rather unorthodox lines.\n\n\n NIEMAND. Yes, I suppose some people would say so.\n\n\n LATHAM. You have broken new ground?\n\n\n NIEMAND. That's true.\n\n\n LATHAM. In what way have your investigations differed from those of  others?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I think our biggest advance was the discovery that sunspots  themselves are not the direct cause of the disturbances we have been  studying on the Earth. It's something like the eruptions in rubeola.  Attention is concentrated on the bright red papules because they're such  a conspicuous symptom of the disease. Whereas the real cause is an  invisible filterable virus. In the solar case it turned out to be these  S-Regions.\n\n\n LATHAM. Why S-Regions?\n\n\n NIEMAND. We had to call them something. Named after the Sun, I suppose.\n\n\n LATHAM. You say an S-Region is invisible?\n\n\n NIEMAND. It is quite invisible to the eye but readily detected by  suitable instrumental methods. It is extremely doubtful, however, if the  radiation we detect is the actual cause of the disturbing effects  observed.\n\n\n LATHAM. Just what are these effects?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Well, they're common enough, goodness knows. As old as the  world, in fact. Yet strangely enough it's hard to describe them in exact  terms.\n\n\n LATHAM. Can you give us a general idea?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I'll try. Let's see ... remember that speech from \"Julius  Caesar\" where Cassius is bewailing the evil times that beset ancient  Rome? I believe it went like this: \"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in  our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings.\"\n\n\n LATHAM. I'm afraid I don't see\u2014\n\n\n NIEMAND. Well, Shakespeare would have been nearer the truth if he had  put it the other way around. \"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in  ourselves but in our stars\" or better \"in the Sun.\" LATHAM. In the Sun?\n\n\n NIEMAND. That's right, in the Sun. I suppose the oldest problem in the  world is the origin of human evil. Philosophers have wrestled with it  ever since the days of Job. And like Job they have usually given up in  despair, convinced that the origin of evil is too deep for the human  mind to solve. Generally they have concluded that man is inherently  wicked and sinful and that is the end of it. Now for the first time  science has thrown new light on this subject.\n\n\n LATHAM. How is that?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Consider the record of history. There are occasional periods  when conditions are fairly calm and peaceful. Art and industry  flourished. Man at last seemed to be making progress toward some higher  goal. Then suddenly\u2014 for no detectable reason \u2014conditions are  reversed. Wars rage. People go mad. The world is plunged into an orgy of  bloodshed and misery.\n\n\n LATHAM. But weren't there reasons?\n\n\n NIEMAND. What reasons?\n\n\n LATHAM. Well, disputes over boundaries ... economic rivalry ... border  incidents....\n\n\n NIEMAND. Nonsense. Men always make some flimsy excuse for going to war.  The truth of the matter is that men go to war because they want to go  to war. They can't help themselves. They are impelled by forces over  which they have no control. By forces outside of themselves.\n\n\n LATHAM. Those are broad, sweeping statements. Can't you be more  specific?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Perhaps I'd better go back to the beginning. Let me see.... It  all started back in March, 1955, when I started getting patients  suffering from a complex of symptoms, such as profound mental  depression, anxiety, insomnia, alternating with fits of violent rage and  resentment against life and the world in general. These people were  deeply disturbed. No doubt about that. Yet they were not psychotic and  hardly more than mildly neurotic. Now every doctor gets a good many  patients of this type. Such a syndrome is characteristic of menopausal  women and some men during the climacteric, but these people failed to  fit into this picture. They were married and single persons of both  sexes and of all ages. They came from all walks of life. The onset of  their attack was invariably sudden and with scarcely any warning. They  would be going about their work feeling perfectly all right. Then in a  minute the whole world was like some scene from a nightmare. A week or  ten days later the attack would cease as mysteriously as it had come and  they would be their old self again.\n\n\n LATHAM. Aren't such attacks characteristic of the stress and strain of  modern life?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I'm afraid that old stress-and-strain theory has been badly  overworked. Been hearing about it ever since I was a pre-med student at  ucla  . Even as a boy I can remember my grandfather deploring the stress  and strain of modern life when he was a country doctor practicing in  Indiana. In my opinion one of the most valuable contributions  anthropologists have made in recent years is the discovery that  primitive man is afflicted with essentially the same neurotic conditions  as those of us who live a so-called civilized life. They have found  savages displaying every symptom of a nervous breakdown among the  mountain tribes of the Elgonyi and the Aruntas of Australia. No, Mr.  Latham, it's time the stress-and-strain theory was relegated to the junk  pile along with demoniac possession and blood letting.\n\n\n LATHAM. You must have done something for your patients\u2014\n\n\n NIEMAND. A doctor must always do something for the patients who come to  his office seeking help. First I gave them a thorough physical  examination. I turned up some minor ailments\u2014a slight heart murmur or a  trace of albumin in the urine\u2014but nothing of any significance. On the  whole they were a remarkably healthy bunch of individuals, much more so  than an average sample of the population. Then I made a searching  inquiry into their personal life. Here again I drew a blank. They had no  particular financial worries. Their sex life was generally satisfactory.  There was no history of mental illness in the family. In fact, the only  thing that seemed to be the matter with them was that there were times  when they felt like hell.\n\n\n LATHAM. I suppose you tried tranquilizers?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Oh, yes. In a few cases in which I tried tranquilizing pills of  the meprobamate type there was some slight improvement. I want to  emphasize, however, that I do not believe in prescribing shotgun  remedies for a patient. To my way of thinking it is a lazy slipshod way  of carrying on the practice of medicine. The only thing for which I do  give myself credit was that I asked my patients to keep a detailed  record of their symptoms taking special care to note the time of  exacerbation\u2014increase in the severity of the symptoms\u2014as accurately as  possible.\n\n\n LATHAM. And this gave you a clue?\n\n\n NIEMAND. It was the beginning. In most instances patients reported the  attack struck with almost the impact of a physical blow. The prodromal  symptoms were usually slight ... a sudden feeling of uneasiness and  guilt ... hot and cold flashes ... dizziness ... double vision. Then  this ghastly sense of depression coupled with a blind insensate rage at  life. One man said he felt as if the world were closing in on him.  Another that he felt the people around him were plotting his  destruction. One housewife made her husband lock her in her room for  fear she would injure the children. I pored over these case histories  for a long time getting absolutely nowhere. Then finally a pattern began  to emerge. LATHAM. What sort of pattern?\n\n\n NIEMAND. The first thing that struck me was that the attacks all  occurred during the daytime, between the hours of about seven in the  morning and five in the evening. Then there were these coincidences\u2014\n\n\n LATHAM. Coincidences?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Total strangers miles apart were stricken at almost the same  moment. At first I thought nothing of it but as my records accumulated I  became convinced it could not be attributed to chance. A mathematical  analysis showed the number of coincidences followed a Poisson  distribution very closely. I couldn't possibly see what daylight had to  do with it. There is some evidence that mental patients are most  disturbed around the time of full moon, but a search of medical  literature failed to reveal any connection with the Sun.\n\n\n LATHAM. What did you do?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Naturally I said nothing of this to my patients. I did,  however, take pains to impress upon them the necessity of keeping an  exact record of the onset of an attack. The better records they kept the  more conclusive was the evidence. Men and women were experiencing nearly  simultaneous attacks of rage and depression all over southern  California, which was as far as my practice extended. One day it  occurred to me: if people a few miles apart could be stricken  simultaneously, why not people hundreds or thousands of miles apart? It  was this idea that prompted me to get in touch with an old colleague of  mine I had known at UC medical school, Dr. Max Hillyard, who was in  practice in Utica, New York.\n\n\n LATHAM. With what result?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I was afraid the result would be that my old roommate would  think I had gone completely crazy. Imagine my surprise and gratification  on receiving an answer by return mail to the effect that he also had  been getting an increasing number of patients suffering with the same  identical symptoms as my own. Furthermore, upon exchanging records we did find that in many cases patients three thousand miles apart had  been stricken simultaneously\u2014\n\n\n LATHAM. Just a minute. I would like to know how you define  \"simultaneous.\"\n\n\n NIEMAND. We say an attack is simultaneous when one occurred on the east  coast, for example, not earlier or later than five minutes of an attack  on the west coast. That is about as close as you can hope to time a  subjective effect of this nature. And now another fact emerged which  gave us another clue.\n\n\n LATHAM. Which was?\n\n\n NIEMAND. In every case of a simultaneous attack the Sun was shining at  both New York and California.\n\n\n LATHAM. You mean if it was cloudy\u2014\n\n\n NIEMAND. No, no. The weather had nothing to do with it. I mean the Sun  had to be above the horizon at both places. A person might undergo an  attack soon after sunrise in New York but there would be no  corresponding record of an attack in California where it was still dark.  Conversely, a person might be stricken late in the afternoon in  California without a corresponding attack in New York where the Sun had  set. Dr. Hillyard and I had been searching desperately for a clue. We  had both noticed that the attacks occurred only during the daylight  hours but this had not seemed especially significant. Here we had  evidence pointing directly to the source of trouble. It must have some  connection with the Sun.\n\n\n LATHAM. That must have had you badly puzzled at first.\n\n\n NIEMAND. It certainly did. It looked as if we were headed back to the  Middle Ages when astrology and medicine went hand in hand. But since it  was our only lead we had no other choice but to follow it regardless of  the consequences. Here luck played somewhat of a part, for Hillyard  happened to have a contact that proved invaluable to us. Several years  before Hillyard had gotten to know a young astrophysicist, Henry  Middletown, who had come to him suffering from a severe case of myositis  in the arms and shoulders. Hillyard had been able to effect a complete  cure for which the boy was very grateful, and they had kept up a  desultory correspondence. Middletown was now specializing in radio  astronomy at the government's new solar observatory on Turtle Back  Mountain in Arizona. If it had not been for Middletown's help I'm afraid  our investigation would never have gotten past the clinical stage.\n\n\n LATHAM. In what way was Middletown of assistance?\n\n\n NIEMAND. It was the old case of workers in one field of science being  completely ignorant of what was going on in another field. Someday we  will have to establish a clearing house in science instead of keeping it  in tight little compartments as we do at present. Well, Hillyard and I  packed up for Arizona with considerable misgivings. We were afraid  Middletown wouldn't take our findings seriously but somewhat to our  surprise he heard our story with the closest attention. I guess  astronomers have gotten so used to hearing from flying saucer  enthusiasts and science-fiction addicts that nothing surprises them any  more. When we had finished he asked to see our records. Hillyard had  them all set down for easy numerical tabulation. Middletown went to work  with scarcely a word. Within an hour he had produced a chart that was  simply astounding. LATHAM. Can you describe this chart for us?\n\n\n NIEMAND. It was really quite simple. But if it had not been for  Middletown's experience in charting other solar phenomena it would never  have occurred to us to do it. First, he laid out a series of about  thirty squares horizontally across a sheet of graph paper. He dated  these beginning March 1, 1955, when our records began. In each square he  put a number from 1 to 10 that was a rough index of the number and  intensity of the attacks reported on that day. Then he laid out another  horizontal row below the first one dated twenty-seven days later. That  is, the square under March 1st in the top row was dated March 28th in  the row below it. He filled in the chart until he had an array of dozens  of rows that included all our data down to May, 1958.\n\n\n When Middletown had finished it was easy to see that the squares of  highest index number did not fall at random on the chart. Instead they  fell in slightly slanting parallel series so that you could draw  straight lines down through them. The connection with the Sun was  obvious.\n\n\n LATHAM. In what way?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Why, because twenty-seven days is about the synodic period of  solar rotation. That is, if you see a large spot at the center of the  Sun's disk today, there is a good chance if it survives that you will  see it at the same place twenty-seven days later. But that night  Middletown produced another chart that showed the connection with the  Sun in a way that was even more convincing.\n\n\n LATHAM. How was that?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I said that the lines drawn down through the days of greatest  mental disturbance slanted slightly. On this second chart the squares  were dated under one another not at intervals of twenty-seven days, but  at intervals of twenty-seven point three days.\n\n\n LATHAM. Why is that so important?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Because the average period of solar rotation in the sunspot  zone is not twenty-seven days but twenty-seven point three days. And on  this chart the lines did not slant but went vertically downward. The  correlation with the synodic rotation of the Sun was practically  perfect.\n\n\n LATHAM. But how did you get onto the S-Regions?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Middletown was immediately struck by the resemblance between  the chart of mental disturbance and one he had been plotting over the  years from his radio observations. Now when he compared the two charts  the resemblance between the two was unmistakable. The pattern shown by  the chart of mental disturbance corresponded in a striking way with the  solar chart but with this difference. The disturbances on the Earth  started two days later on the average than the disturbances due to the  S-Regions on the Sun. In other words, there was a lag of about  forty-eight hours between the two. But otherwise they were almost  identical.\n\n\n LATHAM. But if these S-Regions of Middletown's are invisible how could  he detect them?\n\n\n NIEMAND. The S-Regions are invisible to the eye through an optical telescope, but are detected with ease by a radio telescope. Middletown  had discovered them when he was a graduate student working on radio  astronomy in Australia, and he had followed up his researches with the  more powerful equipment at Turtle Back Mountain. The formation of an  S-Region is heralded by a long series of bursts of a few seconds  duration, when the radiation may increase up to several thousand times  that of the background intensity. These noise storms have been recorded  simultaneously on wavelengths of from one to fifteen meters, which so  far is the upper limit of the observations. In a few instances, however,  intense bursts have also been detected down to fifty cm.\n\n\n LATHAM. I believe you said the periods of mental disturbance last for  about ten or twelve days. How does that tie-in with the S-Regions?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Very closely. You see it takes about twelve days for an  S-Region to pass across the face of the Sun, since the synodic rotation  is twenty-seven point three days.\n\n\n LATHAM. I should think it would be nearer thirteen or fourteen days.\n\n\n NIEMAND. Apparently an S-Region is not particularly effective when it is  just coming on or just going off the disk of the Sun.\n\n\n LATHAM. Are the S-Regions associated with sunspots?\n\n\n NIEMAND. They are connected in this way: that sunspot activity and  S-Region activity certainly go together. The more sunspots the more  violent and intense is the S-Region activity. But there is not a  one-to-one correspondence between sunspots and S-Regions. That is, you  cannot connect a particular sunspot group with a particular S-Region.  The same thing is true of sunspots and magnetic storms.\n\n\n LATHAM. How do you account for this?\n\n\n NIEMAND. We don't account for it. LATHAM. What other properties of the S-Regions have you discovered?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Middletown says that the radio waves emanating from them are  strongly circularly polarized. Moreover, the sense of rotation remains  constant while one is passing across the Sun. If the magnetic field  associated with an S-Region extends into the high solar corona through  which the rays pass, then the sense of rotation corresponds to the  ordinary ray of the magneto-ionic theory.\n\n\n LATHAM. Does this mean that the mental disturbances arise from some form  of electromagnetic radiation?\n\n\n NIEMAND. We doubt it. As I said before, the charts show a lag of about  forty-eight hours between the development of an S-Region and the onset  of mental disturbance. This indicates that the malignant energy  emanating from an S-Region consists of some highly penetrating form of  corpuscular radiation, as yet unidentified.  [A]\n\n\n LATHAM. A question that puzzles me is why some people are affected by  the S-Regions while others are not.\n\n\n NIEMAND. Our latest results indicate that probably no one is  completely immune. All are affected in some degree. Just why some  should be affected so much more than others is still a matter of  speculation.\n\n\n LATHAM. How long does an S-Region last?\n\n\n NIEMAND. An S-Region may have a lifetime of from three to perhaps a  dozen solar rotations. Then it dies out and for a time we are free from  this malignant radiation. Then a new region develops in perhaps an  entirely different region of the Sun. Sometimes there may be several  different S-Regions all going at once.\n\n\n LATHAM. Why were not the S-Regions discovered long ago?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Because the radio exploration of the Sun only began since the  end of World War II.\n\n\n LATHAM. How does it happen that you only got patients suffering from  S-radiation since about 1955?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I think we did get such patients previously but not in large  enough numbers to attract attention. Also the present sunspot cycle  started its rise to maximum about 1954.\n\n\n LATHAM. Is there no way of escaping the S-radiation?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I'm afraid the only sure way is to keep on the unilluminated  side of the Earth which is rather difficult to do. Apparently the  corpuscular beam from an S-Region is several degrees wide and not very  sharply defined, since its effects are felt simultaneously over the  entire continent. Hillyard and Middletown are working on some form of  shielding device but so far without success.\n\n\n LATHAM. What is the present state of S-Region activity?\n\n\n NIEMAND. At the present moment there happens to be no S-Region activity  on the Sun. But a new one may develop at any time. Also, the outlook for  a decrease in activity is not very favorable. Sunspot activity continues  at a high level and is steadily mounting in violence. The last sunspot  cycle had the highest maximum of any since 1780, but the present cycle  bids fair to set an all time record.\n\n\n LATHAM. And so you believe that the S-Regions are the cause of most of  the present trouble in the world. That it is not ourselves but something  outside ourselves\u2014\n\n\n NIEMAND. That is the logical outcome of our investigation. We are  controlled and swayed by forces which in many cases we are powerless to  resist.\n\n\n LATHAM. Could we not be warned of the presence of an S-Region?\n\n\n NIEMAND. The trouble is they seem to develop at random on the Sun. I'm  afraid any warning system would be worse than useless. We would be  crying WOLF! all the time.\n\n\n LATHAM. How may a person who is not particularly susceptible to this  malignant radiation know that one of these regions is active?\n\n\n NIEMAND. If you have a feeling of restlessness and anxiety, if you are  unable to concentrate, if you feel suddenly depressed and discouraged  about yourself, or are filled with resentment toward the world, then you  may be pretty sure that an S-Region is passing across the face of the  Sun. Keep a tight rein on yourself. For it seems that evil will always  be with us ... as long as the Sun shall continue to shine upon this  little world. THE END [A]  Middletown believes that the Intense radiation recently  discovered from information derived from Explorer I and III has no  connection with the corpuscular S-radiation. ",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] This, be it understood, is fiction\u2014nothing but fiction\u2014and not,  under any circumstances, to be considered as having any truth  whatever to it. It's obviously utterly impossible ... isn't it? An interview with Dr. I. M. Niemand, Director of the Psychophysical  Institute of Solar and Terrestrial Relations, Camarillo, California. In the closing days of December, 1957, at the meeting of the American  Association for the Advancement of Science in New York, Dr. Niemand  delivered a paper entitled simply, \"On the Nature of the Solar  S-Regions.\" Owing to its unassuming title the startling implications  contained in the paper were completely overlooked by the press. These  implications are discussed here in an exclusive interview with Dr.  Niemand by Philip Latham. LATHAM. Dr. Niemand, what would you say is your main job?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I suppose you might say my main job today is to find out all I  can between activity on the Sun and various forms of activity on the  Earth.\n\n\n LATHAM. What do you mean by activity on the Sun?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Well, a sunspot is a form of solar activity.\n\n\n LATHAM. Just what is a sunspot?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I'm afraid I can't say just what a sunspot is. I can only  describe it. A sunspot is a region on the Sun that is cooler than its  surroundings. That's why it looks dark. It isn't so hot. Therefore not  so bright.\n\n\n LATHAM. Isn't it true that the number of spots on the Sun rises and  falls in a cycle of eleven years?\n\n\n NIEMAND. The number of spots on the Sun rises and falls in a cycle of about eleven years. That word about makes quite a difference.\n\n\n LATHAM. In what way?\n\n\n NIEMAND. It means you can only approximately predict the future course  of sunspot activity. Sunspots are mighty treacherous things.\n\n\n LATHAM. Haven't there been a great many correlations announced between  sunspots and various effects on the Earth?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Scores of them.\n\n\n LATHAM. What is your opinion of these correlations?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Pure bosh in most cases.\n\n\n LATHAM. But some are valid?\n\n\n NIEMAND. A few. There is unquestionably a correlation between  sunspots and disturbances of the Earth's magnetic field ... radio  fade-outs ... auroras ... things like that.\n\n\n LATHAM. Now, Dr. Niemand, I understand that you have been investigating  solar and terrestrial relationships along rather unorthodox lines.\n\n\n NIEMAND. Yes, I suppose some people would say so.\n\n\n LATHAM. You have broken new ground?\n\n\n NIEMAND. That's true.\n\n\n LATHAM. In what way have your investigations differed from those of  others?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I think our biggest advance was the discovery that sunspots  themselves are not the direct cause of the disturbances we have been  studying on the Earth. It's something like the eruptions in rubeola.  Attention is concentrated on the bright red papules because they're such  a conspicuous symptom of the disease. Whereas the real cause is an  invisible filterable virus. In the solar case it turned out to be these  S-Regions.\n\n\n LATHAM. Why S-Regions?\n\n\n NIEMAND. We had to call them something. Named after the Sun, I suppose.\n\n\n LATHAM. You say an S-Region is invisible?\n\n\n NIEMAND. It is quite invisible to the eye but readily detected by  suitable instrumental methods. It is extremely doubtful, however, if the  radiation we detect is the actual cause of the disturbing effects  observed.\n\n\n LATHAM. Just what are these effects?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Well, they're common enough, goodness knows. As old as the  world, in fact. Yet strangely enough it's hard to describe them in exact  terms.\n\n\n LATHAM. Can you give us a general idea?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I'll try. Let's see ... remember that speech from \"Julius  Caesar\" where Cassius is bewailing the evil times that beset ancient  Rome? I believe it went like this: \"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in  our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings.\"\n\n\n LATHAM. I'm afraid I don't see\u2014\n\n\n NIEMAND. Well, Shakespeare would have been nearer the truth if he had  put it the other way around. \"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in  ourselves but in our stars\" or better \"in the Sun.\" LATHAM. In the Sun?\n\n\n NIEMAND. That's right, in the Sun. I suppose the oldest problem in the  world is the origin of human evil. Philosophers have wrestled with it  ever since the days of Job. And like Job they have usually given up in  despair, convinced that the origin of evil is too deep for the human  mind to solve. Generally they have concluded that man is inherently  wicked and sinful and that is the end of it. Now for the first time  science has thrown new light on this subject.\n\n\n LATHAM. How is that?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Consider the record of history. There are occasional periods  when conditions are fairly calm and peaceful. Art and industry  flourished. Man at last seemed to be making progress toward some higher  goal. Then suddenly\u2014 for no detectable reason \u2014conditions are  reversed. Wars rage. People go mad. The world is plunged into an orgy of  bloodshed and misery.\n\n\n LATHAM. But weren't there reasons?\n\n\n NIEMAND. What reasons?\n\n\n LATHAM. Well, disputes over boundaries ... economic rivalry ... border  incidents....\n\n\n NIEMAND. Nonsense. Men always make some flimsy excuse for going to war.  The truth of the matter is that men go to war because they want to go  to war. They can't help themselves. They are impelled by forces over  which they have no control. By forces outside of themselves.\n\n\n LATHAM. Those are broad, sweeping statements. Can't you be more  specific?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Perhaps I'd better go back to the beginning. Let me see.... It  all started back in March, 1955, when I started getting patients  suffering from a complex of symptoms, such as profound mental  depression, anxiety, insomnia, alternating with fits of violent rage and  resentment against life and the world in general. These people were  deeply disturbed. No doubt about that. Yet they were not psychotic and  hardly more than mildly neurotic. Now every doctor gets a good many  patients of this type. Such a syndrome is characteristic of menopausal  women and some men during the climacteric, but these people failed to  fit into this picture. They were married and single persons of both  sexes and of all ages. They came from all walks of life. The onset of  their attack was invariably sudden and with scarcely any warning. They  would be going about their work feeling perfectly all right. Then in a  minute the whole world was like some scene from a nightmare. A week or  ten days later the attack would cease as mysteriously as it had come and  they would be their old self again.\n\n\n LATHAM. Aren't such attacks characteristic of the stress and strain of  modern life?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I'm afraid that old stress-and-strain theory has been badly  overworked. Been hearing about it ever since I was a pre-med student at  ucla  . Even as a boy I can remember my grandfather deploring the stress  and strain of modern life when he was a country doctor practicing in  Indiana. In my opinion one of the most valuable contributions  anthropologists have made in recent years is the discovery that  primitive man is afflicted with essentially the same neurotic conditions  as those of us who live a so-called civilized life. They have found  savages displaying every symptom of a nervous breakdown among the  mountain tribes of the Elgonyi and the Aruntas of Australia. No, Mr.  Latham, it's time the stress-and-strain theory was relegated to the junk  pile along with demoniac possession and blood letting.\n\n\n LATHAM. You must have done something for your patients\u2014\n\n\n NIEMAND. A doctor must always do something for the patients who come to  his office seeking help. First I gave them a thorough physical  examination. I turned up some minor ailments\u2014a slight heart murmur or a  trace of albumin in the urine\u2014but nothing of any significance. On the  whole they were a remarkably healthy bunch of individuals, much more so  than an average sample of the population. Then I made a searching  inquiry into their personal life. Here again I drew a blank. They had no  particular financial worries. Their sex life was generally satisfactory.  There was no history of mental illness in the family. In fact, the only  thing that seemed to be the matter with them was that there were times  when they felt like hell.\n\n\n LATHAM. I suppose you tried tranquilizers?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Oh, yes. In a few cases in which I tried tranquilizing pills of  the meprobamate type there was some slight improvement. I want to  emphasize, however, that I do not believe in prescribing shotgun  remedies for a patient. To my way of thinking it is a lazy slipshod way  of carrying on the practice of medicine. The only thing for which I do  give myself credit was that I asked my patients to keep a detailed  record of their symptoms taking special care to note the time of  exacerbation\u2014increase in the severity of the symptoms\u2014as accurately as  possible.\n\n\n LATHAM. And this gave you a clue?\n\n\n NIEMAND. It was the beginning. In most instances patients reported the  attack struck with almost the impact of a physical blow. The prodromal  symptoms were usually slight ... a sudden feeling of uneasiness and  guilt ... hot and cold flashes ... dizziness ... double vision. Then  this ghastly sense of depression coupled with a blind insensate rage at  life. One man said he felt as if the world were closing in on him.  Another that he felt the people around him were plotting his  destruction. One housewife made her husband lock her in her room for  fear she would injure the children. I pored over these case histories  for a long time getting absolutely nowhere. Then finally a pattern began  to emerge. LATHAM. What sort of pattern?\n\n\n NIEMAND. The first thing that struck me was that the attacks all  occurred during the daytime, between the hours of about seven in the  morning and five in the evening. Then there were these coincidences\u2014\n\n\n LATHAM. Coincidences?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Total strangers miles apart were stricken at almost the same  moment. At first I thought nothing of it but as my records accumulated I  became convinced it could not be attributed to chance. A mathematical  analysis showed the number of coincidences followed a Poisson  distribution very closely. I couldn't possibly see what daylight had to  do with it. There is some evidence that mental patients are most  disturbed around the time of full moon, but a search of medical  literature failed to reveal any connection with the Sun.\n\n\n LATHAM. What did you do?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Naturally I said nothing of this to my patients. I did,  however, take pains to impress upon them the necessity of keeping an  exact record of the onset of an attack. The better records they kept the  more conclusive was the evidence. Men and women were experiencing nearly  simultaneous attacks of rage and depression all over southern  California, which was as far as my practice extended. One day it  occurred to me: if people a few miles apart could be stricken  simultaneously, why not people hundreds or thousands of miles apart? It  was this idea that prompted me to get in touch with an old colleague of  mine I had known at UC medical school, Dr. Max Hillyard, who was in  practice in Utica, New York.\n\n\n LATHAM. With what result?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I was afraid the result would be that my old roommate would  think I had gone completely crazy. Imagine my surprise and gratification  on receiving an answer by return mail to the effect that he also had  been getting an increasing number of patients suffering with the same  identical symptoms as my own. Furthermore, upon exchanging records we did find that in many cases patients three thousand miles apart had  been stricken simultaneously\u2014\n\n\n LATHAM. Just a minute. I would like to know how you define  \"simultaneous.\"\n\n\n NIEMAND. We say an attack is simultaneous when one occurred on the east  coast, for example, not earlier or later than five minutes of an attack  on the west coast. That is about as close as you can hope to time a  subjective effect of this nature. And now another fact emerged which  gave us another clue.\n\n\n LATHAM. Which was?\n\n\n NIEMAND. In every case of a simultaneous attack the Sun was shining at  both New York and California.\n\n\n LATHAM. You mean if it was cloudy\u2014\n\n\n NIEMAND. No, no. The weather had nothing to do with it. I mean the Sun  had to be above the horizon at both places. A person might undergo an  attack soon after sunrise in New York but there would be no  corresponding record of an attack in California where it was still dark.  Conversely, a person might be stricken late in the afternoon in  California without a corresponding attack in New York where the Sun had  set. Dr. Hillyard and I had been searching desperately for a clue. We  had both noticed that the attacks occurred only during the daylight  hours but this had not seemed especially significant. Here we had  evidence pointing directly to the source of trouble. It must have some  connection with the Sun.\n\n\n LATHAM. That must have had you badly puzzled at first.\n\n\n NIEMAND. It certainly did. It looked as if we were headed back to the  Middle Ages when astrology and medicine went hand in hand. But since it  was our only lead we had no other choice but to follow it regardless of  the consequences. Here luck played somewhat of a part, for Hillyard  happened to have a contact that proved invaluable to us. Several years  before Hillyard had gotten to know a young astrophysicist, Henry  Middletown, who had come to him suffering from a severe case of myositis  in the arms and shoulders. Hillyard had been able to effect a complete  cure for which the boy was very grateful, and they had kept up a  desultory correspondence. Middletown was now specializing in radio  astronomy at the government's new solar observatory on Turtle Back  Mountain in Arizona. If it had not been for Middletown's help I'm afraid  our investigation would never have gotten past the clinical stage.\n\n\n LATHAM. In what way was Middletown of assistance?\n\n\n NIEMAND. It was the old case of workers in one field of science being  completely ignorant of what was going on in another field. Someday we  will have to establish a clearing house in science instead of keeping it  in tight little compartments as we do at present. Well, Hillyard and I  packed up for Arizona with considerable misgivings. We were afraid  Middletown wouldn't take our findings seriously but somewhat to our  surprise he heard our story with the closest attention. I guess  astronomers have gotten so used to hearing from flying saucer  enthusiasts and science-fiction addicts that nothing surprises them any  more. When we had finished he asked to see our records. Hillyard had  them all set down for easy numerical tabulation. Middletown went to work  with scarcely a word. Within an hour he had produced a chart that was  simply astounding. LATHAM. Can you describe this chart for us?\n\n\n NIEMAND. It was really quite simple. But if it had not been for  Middletown's experience in charting other solar phenomena it would never  have occurred to us to do it. First, he laid out a series of about  thirty squares horizontally across a sheet of graph paper. He dated  these beginning March 1, 1955, when our records began. In each square he  put a number from 1 to 10 that was a rough index of the number and  intensity of the attacks reported on that day. Then he laid out another  horizontal row below the first one dated twenty-seven days later. That  is, the square under March 1st in the top row was dated March 28th in  the row below it. He filled in the chart until he had an array of dozens  of rows that included all our data down to May, 1958.\n\n\n When Middletown had finished it was easy to see that the squares of  highest index number did not fall at random on the chart. Instead they  fell in slightly slanting parallel series so that you could draw  straight lines down through them. The connection with the Sun was  obvious.\n\n\n LATHAM. In what way?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Why, because twenty-seven days is about the synodic period of  solar rotation. That is, if you see a large spot at the center of the  Sun's disk today, there is a good chance if it survives that you will  see it at the same place twenty-seven days later. But that night  Middletown produced another chart that showed the connection with the  Sun in a way that was even more convincing.\n\n\n LATHAM. How was that?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I said that the lines drawn down through the days of greatest  mental disturbance slanted slightly. On this second chart the squares  were dated under one another not at intervals of twenty-seven days, but  at intervals of twenty-seven point three days.\n\n\n LATHAM. Why is that so important?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Because the average period of solar rotation in the sunspot  zone is not twenty-seven days but twenty-seven point three days. And on  this chart the lines did not slant but went vertically downward. The  correlation with the synodic rotation of the Sun was practically  perfect.\n\n\n LATHAM. But how did you get onto the S-Regions?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Middletown was immediately struck by the resemblance between  the chart of mental disturbance and one he had been plotting over the  years from his radio observations. Now when he compared the two charts  the resemblance between the two was unmistakable. The pattern shown by  the chart of mental disturbance corresponded in a striking way with the  solar chart but with this difference. The disturbances on the Earth  started two days later on the average than the disturbances due to the  S-Regions on the Sun. In other words, there was a lag of about  forty-eight hours between the two. But otherwise they were almost  identical.\n\n\n LATHAM. But if these S-Regions of Middletown's are invisible how could  he detect them?\n\n\n NIEMAND. The S-Regions are invisible to the eye through an optical telescope, but are detected with ease by a radio telescope. Middletown  had discovered them when he was a graduate student working on radio  astronomy in Australia, and he had followed up his researches with the  more powerful equipment at Turtle Back Mountain. The formation of an  S-Region is heralded by a long series of bursts of a few seconds  duration, when the radiation may increase up to several thousand times  that of the background intensity. These noise storms have been recorded  simultaneously on wavelengths of from one to fifteen meters, which so  far is the upper limit of the observations. In a few instances, however,  intense bursts have also been detected down to fifty cm.\n\n\n LATHAM. I believe you said the periods of mental disturbance last for  about ten or twelve days. How does that tie-in with the S-Regions?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Very closely. You see it takes about twelve days for an  S-Region to pass across the face of the Sun, since the synodic rotation  is twenty-seven point three days.\n\n\n LATHAM. I should think it would be nearer thirteen or fourteen days.\n\n\n NIEMAND. Apparently an S-Region is not particularly effective when it is  just coming on or just going off the disk of the Sun.\n\n\n LATHAM. Are the S-Regions associated with sunspots?\n\n\n NIEMAND. They are connected in this way: that sunspot activity and  S-Region activity certainly go together. The more sunspots the more  violent and intense is the S-Region activity. But there is not a  one-to-one correspondence between sunspots and S-Regions. That is, you  cannot connect a particular sunspot group with a particular S-Region.  The same thing is true of sunspots and magnetic storms.\n\n\n LATHAM. How do you account for this?\n\n\n NIEMAND. We don't account for it. LATHAM. What other properties of the S-Regions have you discovered?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Middletown says that the radio waves emanating from them are  strongly circularly polarized. Moreover, the sense of rotation remains  constant while one is passing across the Sun. If the magnetic field  associated with an S-Region extends into the high solar corona through  which the rays pass, then the sense of rotation corresponds to the  ordinary ray of the magneto-ionic theory.\n\n\n LATHAM. Does this mean that the mental disturbances arise from some form  of electromagnetic radiation?\n\n\n NIEMAND. We doubt it. As I said before, the charts show a lag of about  forty-eight hours between the development of an S-Region and the onset  of mental disturbance. This indicates that the malignant energy  emanating from an S-Region consists of some highly penetrating form of  corpuscular radiation, as yet unidentified.  [A]\n\n\n LATHAM. A question that puzzles me is why some people are affected by  the S-Regions while others are not.\n\n\n NIEMAND. Our latest results indicate that probably no one is  completely immune. All are affected in some degree. Just why some  should be affected so much more than others is still a matter of  speculation.\n\n\n LATHAM. How long does an S-Region last?\n\n\n NIEMAND. An S-Region may have a lifetime of from three to perhaps a  dozen solar rotations. Then it dies out and for a time we are free from  this malignant radiation. Then a new region develops in perhaps an  entirely different region of the Sun. Sometimes there may be several  different S-Regions all going at once.\n\n\n LATHAM. Why were not the S-Regions discovered long ago?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Because the radio exploration of the Sun only began since the  end of World War II.\n\n\n LATHAM. How does it happen that you only got patients suffering from  S-radiation since about 1955?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I think we did get such patients previously but not in large  enough numbers to attract attention. Also the present sunspot cycle  started its rise to maximum about 1954.\n\n\n LATHAM. Is there no way of escaping the S-radiation?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I'm afraid the only sure way is to keep on the unilluminated  side of the Earth which is rather difficult to do. Apparently the  corpuscular beam from an S-Region is several degrees wide and not very  sharply defined, since its effects are felt simultaneously over the  entire continent. Hillyard and Middletown are working on some form of  shielding device but so far without success.\n\n\n LATHAM. What is the present state of S-Region activity?\n\n\n NIEMAND. At the present moment there happens to be no S-Region activity  on the Sun. But a new one may develop at any time. Also, the outlook for  a decrease in activity is not very favorable. Sunspot activity continues  at a high level and is steadily mounting in violence. The last sunspot  cycle had the highest maximum of any since 1780, but the present cycle  bids fair to set an all time record.\n\n\n LATHAM. And so you believe that the S-Regions are the cause of most of  the present trouble in the world. That it is not ourselves but something  outside ourselves\u2014\n\n\n NIEMAND. That is the logical outcome of our investigation. We are  controlled and swayed by forces which in many cases we are powerless to  resist.\n\n\n LATHAM. Could we not be warned of the presence of an S-Region?\n\n\n NIEMAND. The trouble is they seem to develop at random on the Sun. I'm  afraid any warning system would be worse than useless. We would be  crying WOLF! all the time.\n\n\n LATHAM. How may a person who is not particularly susceptible to this  malignant radiation know that one of these regions is active?\n\n\n NIEMAND. If you have a feeling of restlessness and anxiety, if you are  unable to concentrate, if you feel suddenly depressed and discouraged  about yourself, or are filled with resentment toward the world, then you  may be pretty sure that an S-Region is passing across the face of the  Sun. Keep a tight rein on yourself. For it seems that evil will always  be with us ... as long as the Sun shall continue to shine upon this  little world. THE END [A]  Middletown believes that the Intense radiation recently  discovered from information derived from Explorer I and III has no  connection with the corpuscular S-radiation. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich statement most accurately represents Niemand's beliefs toward humans and free will?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Humans have the free will to pursue their desires, which are in part influenced by external influences\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Some humans have more control over the impact of sunspot disturbances on their mental health than others\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Some humans have more control over the impact of sunspot disturbances on their mental health than others\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Some humans have more control over the impact of sunspot disturbances on their mental health than others\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] This, be it understood, is fiction\u2014nothing but fiction\u2014and not,  under any circumstances, to be considered as having any truth  whatever to it. It's obviously utterly impossible ... isn't it? An interview with Dr. I. M. Niemand, Director of the Psychophysical  Institute of Solar and Terrestrial Relations, Camarillo, California. In the closing days of December, 1957, at the meeting of the American  Association for the Advancement of Science in New York, Dr. Niemand  delivered a paper entitled simply, \"On the Nature of the Solar  S-Regions.\" Owing to its unassuming title the startling implications  contained in the paper were completely overlooked by the press. These  implications are discussed here in an exclusive interview with Dr.  Niemand by Philip Latham. LATHAM. Dr. Niemand, what would you say is your main job?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I suppose you might say my main job today is to find out all I  can between activity on the Sun and various forms of activity on the  Earth.\n\n\n LATHAM. What do you mean by activity on the Sun?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Well, a sunspot is a form of solar activity.\n\n\n LATHAM. Just what is a sunspot?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I'm afraid I can't say just what a sunspot is. I can only  describe it. A sunspot is a region on the Sun that is cooler than its  surroundings. That's why it looks dark. It isn't so hot. Therefore not  so bright.\n\n\n LATHAM. Isn't it true that the number of spots on the Sun rises and  falls in a cycle of eleven years?\n\n\n NIEMAND. The number of spots on the Sun rises and falls in a cycle of about eleven years. That word about makes quite a difference.\n\n\n LATHAM. In what way?\n\n\n NIEMAND. It means you can only approximately predict the future course  of sunspot activity. Sunspots are mighty treacherous things.\n\n\n LATHAM. Haven't there been a great many correlations announced between  sunspots and various effects on the Earth?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Scores of them.\n\n\n LATHAM. What is your opinion of these correlations?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Pure bosh in most cases.\n\n\n LATHAM. But some are valid?\n\n\n NIEMAND. A few. There is unquestionably a correlation between  sunspots and disturbances of the Earth's magnetic field ... radio  fade-outs ... auroras ... things like that.\n\n\n LATHAM. Now, Dr. Niemand, I understand that you have been investigating  solar and terrestrial relationships along rather unorthodox lines.\n\n\n NIEMAND. Yes, I suppose some people would say so.\n\n\n LATHAM. You have broken new ground?\n\n\n NIEMAND. That's true.\n\n\n LATHAM. In what way have your investigations differed from those of  others?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I think our biggest advance was the discovery that sunspots  themselves are not the direct cause of the disturbances we have been  studying on the Earth. It's something like the eruptions in rubeola.  Attention is concentrated on the bright red papules because they're such  a conspicuous symptom of the disease. Whereas the real cause is an  invisible filterable virus. In the solar case it turned out to be these  S-Regions.\n\n\n LATHAM. Why S-Regions?\n\n\n NIEMAND. We had to call them something. Named after the Sun, I suppose.\n\n\n LATHAM. You say an S-Region is invisible?\n\n\n NIEMAND. It is quite invisible to the eye but readily detected by  suitable instrumental methods. It is extremely doubtful, however, if the  radiation we detect is the actual cause of the disturbing effects  observed.\n\n\n LATHAM. Just what are these effects?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Well, they're common enough, goodness knows. As old as the  world, in fact. Yet strangely enough it's hard to describe them in exact  terms.\n\n\n LATHAM. Can you give us a general idea?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I'll try. Let's see ... remember that speech from \"Julius  Caesar\" where Cassius is bewailing the evil times that beset ancient  Rome? I believe it went like this: \"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in  our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings.\"\n\n\n LATHAM. I'm afraid I don't see\u2014\n\n\n NIEMAND. Well, Shakespeare would have been nearer the truth if he had  put it the other way around. \"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in  ourselves but in our stars\" or better \"in the Sun.\" LATHAM. In the Sun?\n\n\n NIEMAND. That's right, in the Sun. I suppose the oldest problem in the  world is the origin of human evil. Philosophers have wrestled with it  ever since the days of Job. And like Job they have usually given up in  despair, convinced that the origin of evil is too deep for the human  mind to solve. Generally they have concluded that man is inherently  wicked and sinful and that is the end of it. Now for the first time  science has thrown new light on this subject.\n\n\n LATHAM. How is that?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Consider the record of history. There are occasional periods  when conditions are fairly calm and peaceful. Art and industry  flourished. Man at last seemed to be making progress toward some higher  goal. Then suddenly\u2014 for no detectable reason \u2014conditions are  reversed. Wars rage. People go mad. The world is plunged into an orgy of  bloodshed and misery.\n\n\n LATHAM. But weren't there reasons?\n\n\n NIEMAND. What reasons?\n\n\n LATHAM. Well, disputes over boundaries ... economic rivalry ... border  incidents....\n\n\n NIEMAND. Nonsense. Men always make some flimsy excuse for going to war.  The truth of the matter is that men go to war because they want to go  to war. They can't help themselves. They are impelled by forces over  which they have no control. By forces outside of themselves.\n\n\n LATHAM. Those are broad, sweeping statements. Can't you be more  specific?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Perhaps I'd better go back to the beginning. Let me see.... It  all started back in March, 1955, when I started getting patients  suffering from a complex of symptoms, such as profound mental  depression, anxiety, insomnia, alternating with fits of violent rage and  resentment against life and the world in general. These people were  deeply disturbed. No doubt about that. Yet they were not psychotic and  hardly more than mildly neurotic. Now every doctor gets a good many  patients of this type. Such a syndrome is characteristic of menopausal  women and some men during the climacteric, but these people failed to  fit into this picture. They were married and single persons of both  sexes and of all ages. They came from all walks of life. The onset of  their attack was invariably sudden and with scarcely any warning. They  would be going about their work feeling perfectly all right. Then in a  minute the whole world was like some scene from a nightmare. A week or  ten days later the attack would cease as mysteriously as it had come and  they would be their old self again.\n\n\n LATHAM. Aren't such attacks characteristic of the stress and strain of  modern life?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I'm afraid that old stress-and-strain theory has been badly  overworked. Been hearing about it ever since I was a pre-med student at  ucla  . Even as a boy I can remember my grandfather deploring the stress  and strain of modern life when he was a country doctor practicing in  Indiana. In my opinion one of the most valuable contributions  anthropologists have made in recent years is the discovery that  primitive man is afflicted with essentially the same neurotic conditions  as those of us who live a so-called civilized life. They have found  savages displaying every symptom of a nervous breakdown among the  mountain tribes of the Elgonyi and the Aruntas of Australia. No, Mr.  Latham, it's time the stress-and-strain theory was relegated to the junk  pile along with demoniac possession and blood letting.\n\n\n LATHAM. You must have done something for your patients\u2014\n\n\n NIEMAND. A doctor must always do something for the patients who come to  his office seeking help. First I gave them a thorough physical  examination. I turned up some minor ailments\u2014a slight heart murmur or a  trace of albumin in the urine\u2014but nothing of any significance. On the  whole they were a remarkably healthy bunch of individuals, much more so  than an average sample of the population. Then I made a searching  inquiry into their personal life. Here again I drew a blank. They had no  particular financial worries. Their sex life was generally satisfactory.  There was no history of mental illness in the family. In fact, the only  thing that seemed to be the matter with them was that there were times  when they felt like hell.\n\n\n LATHAM. I suppose you tried tranquilizers?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Oh, yes. In a few cases in which I tried tranquilizing pills of  the meprobamate type there was some slight improvement. I want to  emphasize, however, that I do not believe in prescribing shotgun  remedies for a patient. To my way of thinking it is a lazy slipshod way  of carrying on the practice of medicine. The only thing for which I do  give myself credit was that I asked my patients to keep a detailed  record of their symptoms taking special care to note the time of  exacerbation\u2014increase in the severity of the symptoms\u2014as accurately as  possible.\n\n\n LATHAM. And this gave you a clue?\n\n\n NIEMAND. It was the beginning. In most instances patients reported the  attack struck with almost the impact of a physical blow. The prodromal  symptoms were usually slight ... a sudden feeling of uneasiness and  guilt ... hot and cold flashes ... dizziness ... double vision. Then  this ghastly sense of depression coupled with a blind insensate rage at  life. One man said he felt as if the world were closing in on him.  Another that he felt the people around him were plotting his  destruction. One housewife made her husband lock her in her room for  fear she would injure the children. I pored over these case histories  for a long time getting absolutely nowhere. Then finally a pattern began  to emerge. LATHAM. What sort of pattern?\n\n\n NIEMAND. The first thing that struck me was that the attacks all  occurred during the daytime, between the hours of about seven in the  morning and five in the evening. Then there were these coincidences\u2014\n\n\n LATHAM. Coincidences?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Total strangers miles apart were stricken at almost the same  moment. At first I thought nothing of it but as my records accumulated I  became convinced it could not be attributed to chance. A mathematical  analysis showed the number of coincidences followed a Poisson  distribution very closely. I couldn't possibly see what daylight had to  do with it. There is some evidence that mental patients are most  disturbed around the time of full moon, but a search of medical  literature failed to reveal any connection with the Sun.\n\n\n LATHAM. What did you do?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Naturally I said nothing of this to my patients. I did,  however, take pains to impress upon them the necessity of keeping an  exact record of the onset of an attack. The better records they kept the  more conclusive was the evidence. Men and women were experiencing nearly  simultaneous attacks of rage and depression all over southern  California, which was as far as my practice extended. One day it  occurred to me: if people a few miles apart could be stricken  simultaneously, why not people hundreds or thousands of miles apart? It  was this idea that prompted me to get in touch with an old colleague of  mine I had known at UC medical school, Dr. Max Hillyard, who was in  practice in Utica, New York.\n\n\n LATHAM. With what result?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I was afraid the result would be that my old roommate would  think I had gone completely crazy. Imagine my surprise and gratification  on receiving an answer by return mail to the effect that he also had  been getting an increasing number of patients suffering with the same  identical symptoms as my own. Furthermore, upon exchanging records we did find that in many cases patients three thousand miles apart had  been stricken simultaneously\u2014\n\n\n LATHAM. Just a minute. I would like to know how you define  \"simultaneous.\"\n\n\n NIEMAND. We say an attack is simultaneous when one occurred on the east  coast, for example, not earlier or later than five minutes of an attack  on the west coast. That is about as close as you can hope to time a  subjective effect of this nature. And now another fact emerged which  gave us another clue.\n\n\n LATHAM. Which was?\n\n\n NIEMAND. In every case of a simultaneous attack the Sun was shining at  both New York and California.\n\n\n LATHAM. You mean if it was cloudy\u2014\n\n\n NIEMAND. No, no. The weather had nothing to do with it. I mean the Sun  had to be above the horizon at both places. A person might undergo an  attack soon after sunrise in New York but there would be no  corresponding record of an attack in California where it was still dark.  Conversely, a person might be stricken late in the afternoon in  California without a corresponding attack in New York where the Sun had  set. Dr. Hillyard and I had been searching desperately for a clue. We  had both noticed that the attacks occurred only during the daylight  hours but this had not seemed especially significant. Here we had  evidence pointing directly to the source of trouble. It must have some  connection with the Sun.\n\n\n LATHAM. That must have had you badly puzzled at first.\n\n\n NIEMAND. It certainly did. It looked as if we were headed back to the  Middle Ages when astrology and medicine went hand in hand. But since it  was our only lead we had no other choice but to follow it regardless of  the consequences. Here luck played somewhat of a part, for Hillyard  happened to have a contact that proved invaluable to us. Several years  before Hillyard had gotten to know a young astrophysicist, Henry  Middletown, who had come to him suffering from a severe case of myositis  in the arms and shoulders. Hillyard had been able to effect a complete  cure for which the boy was very grateful, and they had kept up a  desultory correspondence. Middletown was now specializing in radio  astronomy at the government's new solar observatory on Turtle Back  Mountain in Arizona. If it had not been for Middletown's help I'm afraid  our investigation would never have gotten past the clinical stage.\n\n\n LATHAM. In what way was Middletown of assistance?\n\n\n NIEMAND. It was the old case of workers in one field of science being  completely ignorant of what was going on in another field. Someday we  will have to establish a clearing house in science instead of keeping it  in tight little compartments as we do at present. Well, Hillyard and I  packed up for Arizona with considerable misgivings. We were afraid  Middletown wouldn't take our findings seriously but somewhat to our  surprise he heard our story with the closest attention. I guess  astronomers have gotten so used to hearing from flying saucer  enthusiasts and science-fiction addicts that nothing surprises them any  more. When we had finished he asked to see our records. Hillyard had  them all set down for easy numerical tabulation. Middletown went to work  with scarcely a word. Within an hour he had produced a chart that was  simply astounding. LATHAM. Can you describe this chart for us?\n\n\n NIEMAND. It was really quite simple. But if it had not been for  Middletown's experience in charting other solar phenomena it would never  have occurred to us to do it. First, he laid out a series of about  thirty squares horizontally across a sheet of graph paper. He dated  these beginning March 1, 1955, when our records began. In each square he  put a number from 1 to 10 that was a rough index of the number and  intensity of the attacks reported on that day. Then he laid out another  horizontal row below the first one dated twenty-seven days later. That  is, the square under March 1st in the top row was dated March 28th in  the row below it. He filled in the chart until he had an array of dozens  of rows that included all our data down to May, 1958.\n\n\n When Middletown had finished it was easy to see that the squares of  highest index number did not fall at random on the chart. Instead they  fell in slightly slanting parallel series so that you could draw  straight lines down through them. The connection with the Sun was  obvious.\n\n\n LATHAM. In what way?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Why, because twenty-seven days is about the synodic period of  solar rotation. That is, if you see a large spot at the center of the  Sun's disk today, there is a good chance if it survives that you will  see it at the same place twenty-seven days later. But that night  Middletown produced another chart that showed the connection with the  Sun in a way that was even more convincing.\n\n\n LATHAM. How was that?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I said that the lines drawn down through the days of greatest  mental disturbance slanted slightly. On this second chart the squares  were dated under one another not at intervals of twenty-seven days, but  at intervals of twenty-seven point three days.\n\n\n LATHAM. Why is that so important?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Because the average period of solar rotation in the sunspot  zone is not twenty-seven days but twenty-seven point three days. And on  this chart the lines did not slant but went vertically downward. The  correlation with the synodic rotation of the Sun was practically  perfect.\n\n\n LATHAM. But how did you get onto the S-Regions?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Middletown was immediately struck by the resemblance between  the chart of mental disturbance and one he had been plotting over the  years from his radio observations. Now when he compared the two charts  the resemblance between the two was unmistakable. The pattern shown by  the chart of mental disturbance corresponded in a striking way with the  solar chart but with this difference. The disturbances on the Earth  started two days later on the average than the disturbances due to the  S-Regions on the Sun. In other words, there was a lag of about  forty-eight hours between the two. But otherwise they were almost  identical.\n\n\n LATHAM. But if these S-Regions of Middletown's are invisible how could  he detect them?\n\n\n NIEMAND. The S-Regions are invisible to the eye through an optical telescope, but are detected with ease by a radio telescope. Middletown  had discovered them when he was a graduate student working on radio  astronomy in Australia, and he had followed up his researches with the  more powerful equipment at Turtle Back Mountain. The formation of an  S-Region is heralded by a long series of bursts of a few seconds  duration, when the radiation may increase up to several thousand times  that of the background intensity. These noise storms have been recorded  simultaneously on wavelengths of from one to fifteen meters, which so  far is the upper limit of the observations. In a few instances, however,  intense bursts have also been detected down to fifty cm.\n\n\n LATHAM. I believe you said the periods of mental disturbance last for  about ten or twelve days. How does that tie-in with the S-Regions?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Very closely. You see it takes about twelve days for an  S-Region to pass across the face of the Sun, since the synodic rotation  is twenty-seven point three days.\n\n\n LATHAM. I should think it would be nearer thirteen or fourteen days.\n\n\n NIEMAND. Apparently an S-Region is not particularly effective when it is  just coming on or just going off the disk of the Sun.\n\n\n LATHAM. Are the S-Regions associated with sunspots?\n\n\n NIEMAND. They are connected in this way: that sunspot activity and  S-Region activity certainly go together. The more sunspots the more  violent and intense is the S-Region activity. But there is not a  one-to-one correspondence between sunspots and S-Regions. That is, you  cannot connect a particular sunspot group with a particular S-Region.  The same thing is true of sunspots and magnetic storms.\n\n\n LATHAM. How do you account for this?\n\n\n NIEMAND. We don't account for it. LATHAM. What other properties of the S-Regions have you discovered?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Middletown says that the radio waves emanating from them are  strongly circularly polarized. Moreover, the sense of rotation remains  constant while one is passing across the Sun. If the magnetic field  associated with an S-Region extends into the high solar corona through  which the rays pass, then the sense of rotation corresponds to the  ordinary ray of the magneto-ionic theory.\n\n\n LATHAM. Does this mean that the mental disturbances arise from some form  of electromagnetic radiation?\n\n\n NIEMAND. We doubt it. As I said before, the charts show a lag of about  forty-eight hours between the development of an S-Region and the onset  of mental disturbance. This indicates that the malignant energy  emanating from an S-Region consists of some highly penetrating form of  corpuscular radiation, as yet unidentified.  [A]\n\n\n LATHAM. A question that puzzles me is why some people are affected by  the S-Regions while others are not.\n\n\n NIEMAND. Our latest results indicate that probably no one is  completely immune. All are affected in some degree. Just why some  should be affected so much more than others is still a matter of  speculation.\n\n\n LATHAM. How long does an S-Region last?\n\n\n NIEMAND. An S-Region may have a lifetime of from three to perhaps a  dozen solar rotations. Then it dies out and for a time we are free from  this malignant radiation. Then a new region develops in perhaps an  entirely different region of the Sun. Sometimes there may be several  different S-Regions all going at once.\n\n\n LATHAM. Why were not the S-Regions discovered long ago?\n\n\n NIEMAND. Because the radio exploration of the Sun only began since the  end of World War II.\n\n\n LATHAM. How does it happen that you only got patients suffering from  S-radiation since about 1955?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I think we did get such patients previously but not in large  enough numbers to attract attention. Also the present sunspot cycle  started its rise to maximum about 1954.\n\n\n LATHAM. Is there no way of escaping the S-radiation?\n\n\n NIEMAND. I'm afraid the only sure way is to keep on the unilluminated  side of the Earth which is rather difficult to do. Apparently the  corpuscular beam from an S-Region is several degrees wide and not very  sharply defined, since its effects are felt simultaneously over the  entire continent. Hillyard and Middletown are working on some form of  shielding device but so far without success.\n\n\n LATHAM. What is the present state of S-Region activity?\n\n\n NIEMAND. At the present moment there happens to be no S-Region activity  on the Sun. But a new one may develop at any time. Also, the outlook for  a decrease in activity is not very favorable. Sunspot activity continues  at a high level and is steadily mounting in violence. The last sunspot  cycle had the highest maximum of any since 1780, but the present cycle  bids fair to set an all time record.\n\n\n LATHAM. And so you believe that the S-Regions are the cause of most of  the present trouble in the world. That it is not ourselves but something  outside ourselves\u2014\n\n\n NIEMAND. That is the logical outcome of our investigation. We are  controlled and swayed by forces which in many cases we are powerless to  resist.\n\n\n LATHAM. Could we not be warned of the presence of an S-Region?\n\n\n NIEMAND. The trouble is they seem to develop at random on the Sun. I'm  afraid any warning system would be worse than useless. We would be  crying WOLF! all the time.\n\n\n LATHAM. How may a person who is not particularly susceptible to this  malignant radiation know that one of these regions is active?\n\n\n NIEMAND. If you have a feeling of restlessness and anxiety, if you are  unable to concentrate, if you feel suddenly depressed and discouraged  about yourself, or are filled with resentment toward the world, then you  may be pretty sure that an S-Region is passing across the face of the  Sun. Keep a tight rein on yourself. For it seems that evil will always  be with us ... as long as the Sun shall continue to shine upon this  little world. THE END [A]  Middletown believes that the Intense radiation recently  discovered from information derived from Explorer I and III has no  connection with the corpuscular S-radiation. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich statement most accurately represents Niemand's beliefs toward humans and free will?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Humans have the free will to pursue their desires, which are in part influenced by external influences\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Some humans have more control over the impact of sunspot disturbances on their mental health than others\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Some humans have more control over the impact of sunspot disturbances on their mental health than others\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Some humans have more control over the impact of sunspot disturbances on their mental health than others\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
