      "background_text": "WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SHOOK By Robert Abernathy Illustrated by Kelly Freas [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction March 1954. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Dark was the Ryzga mountain and forbidding; steep were its  cliffs and sheer its crevasses. But its outward perils could not compare  with the Ryzgas themselves, who slept within, ready to wake and  conquer.... At sunset they were in sight of the Ryzga mountain. Strangely it towered  among the cliffs and snow-slopes of the surrounding ranges: an immense  and repellently geometric cone, black, its sides blood-tinted by the  dying sun.\n\n\n Neena shivered, even though the surrounding cold could not reach her.  The ice-wind blew from the glacier, but Var's love was round her as a  warming cloak, a cloak that glowed softly golden in the deepening  twilight, even as her love was about him.\n\n\n Var said, \"The Watcher's cave should be three miles beyond this pass.\"  He stood rigid, trying to catch an echo of the Watcher's thoughts, but  there was nothing. Perhaps the old man was resting. From the other  direction, the long way that they two had come, it was not difficult to  sense the thought of Groz. That thought was powerful, and heavy with  vengeance.\n\n\n \"Hurry,\" said Neena. \"They're closer than they were an hour ago.\"\n\n\n She was beautiful and defiant, facing the red sunset and the black  mountain. Var sensed her fear, and the love that had conquered it. He  felt a wave of tenderness and bitterness. For him she had come to this.  For the flame that had sprung between them at the Truce of New Grass,  she had challenged the feud of their peoples and had left her home, to  follow him. Now, if her father and his kinsmen overtook them, it would  be death for Var, and for Neena living shame. Which of the two was worse  was no longer a simple problem to Var, who had grown much older in the  last days.\n\n\n \"Wait,\" he commanded. While she waited he spun a dream, attaching it to  the crags that loomed over the pass, and to the frozen ground underfoot.  It was black night, as it would really be when Groz and his henchmen  reached this place; lurid fire spewed from the Ryzga mountain, and  strange lights dipped above it; and for good measure there was an  avalanche in the dream, and hideous beasts rushed snapping and ravening  from the crevices of the rock.\n\n\n \"Oh!\" cried Neena in involuntary alarm.\n\n\n Var sighed, shaking his head. \"It won't hold them for long, but it's the  best I can do now. Come on.\"\n\n\n There was no path. Now they were descending the steeper face of the  sierra, and the way led over bottomless crevasses, sheer drops and sheer  ascents, sheets of traitorous glare ice. Place after place had to be  crossed on the air, and both grew weary with the effort such crossings  cost. They hoarded their strength, helping one another; one alone might  never have won through.\n\n\n It was starry night already when they saw the light from the Watcher's  cave. The light shone watery and dim from beneath the hoary back of the  glacier, and as they came nearer they saw why: the cave entrance was  sealed by a sheet of ice, a frozen waterfall that fell motionless from  the rocks above. They heard no sound.\n\n\n The two young people stared for a long minute, intrigued and fearful.  Both had heard of this place, and the ancient who lived there to keep  watch on the Ryzga mountain, as a part of the oldest legends of their  childhood; but neither had been here before.\n\n\n But this was no time for shyness. Var eyed the ice-curtain closely to  make sure that it was real, not dream-stuff; then he struck it boldly  with his fist. It shattered and fell in a rain of splinters, sparkling  in the light that poured from within. They felt the Watcher rouse, heard his footsteps, and finally saw him\u2014a  shrunken old man, white-haired, with a lined beardless face. The sight  of him, more marred by age than anyone they had ever seen before, was  disappointing. They had expected something more\u2014an ancient giant, a  tower of wisdom and strength. The Watcher was four hundred years old;  beside him even Groz, who had always seemed so ancient, was like a boy.\n\n\n The Watcher peered at them in turn. \"Welcome,\" he said in a cracked  voice. He did not speak again; the rest of his conversation was in  thought only. \"Welcome indeed. I am too much alone here.\"\n\n\n \"You were asleep!\" said Var. Shock made his thought accusing, though he  had not meant to be.\n\n\n The old man grinned toothlessly. \"Never fear. Asleep or awake, I watch.  Come in! You're letting in the wind.\"\n\n\n Inside the cave it was warm as summer. Var saw with some surprise that  all the walls were sheathed in ice\u2014warm to the touch, bound fast  against melting by the Watcher's will. Light blazed in reflections from  the ice walls, till there was no shadow in the place. Behind them began  a tinkling of falling water, thawed from the glacial ridges above to  descend sheet-wise over the cave mouth, freezing as it fell into  lengthening icicles. The old man gazed at his work for a moment, then  turned questioningly to the young pair.\n\n\n \"We need a little rest out of the cold,\" said Var. \"And food, if you can  spare it. We're pursued.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes. You shall have what I can give you. Make yourselves  comfortable, and in one minute.... Pursued, eh? A pity. I see the world  is as bad as it was when I was last in it.\"\n\n\n Hot food and drink were before them almost at once. The Watcher regarded  them with compassion as their eyes brightened and some of the shadow of  weariness lifted from them. \"You have stolen your enemy's daughter, no  doubt, young man? Such things happened when I was young.\"\n\n\n Warming to the old man now, Var sketched his and Neena's history  briefly. \"We should have been safe among my people by now. And before  very long, I'm sure, I would have performed some deed which Groz would  recognize as a worthy exploit, and would thus have healed the feud  between our families. But our flight was found out too soon. They cut us  off and forced us into the mountains, and now they are only a few hours  behind us.\"\n\n\n \"A pity, indeed. I would like to help you\u2014but, you understand, I am the  Mountain Watcher. I must be above feuds and families.\"\n\n\n Var nodded somberly, thinking that an old recluse would in any case be  able to do little for them against Groz and his violent kinsfolk.\n\n\n \"And what will you do now?\"\n\n\n Var grinned mirthlessly. \"We haven't much choice, since they're  overtaking us. I have only one idea left: we can go where Groz may fear  to follow us.\"\n\n\n \"To the mountain, you mean.\"\n\n\n \"And into it, if need be.\"\n\n\n The Watcher was broodingly silent; his eyes shifted to Neena, where she  nestled by Var's side. He asked, \"And you\u2014are you willing to follow  your lover in this?\"\n\n\n Neena returned his gaze without flinching; then she looked sidelong at  Var, and her lips curled with a proud and tender mockery. \"Follow? Why,  I will lead, if his courage should fail him.\" The old man said, \"It is no part of my duty to dissuade you from this  thing. You are free persons. But I must be sure that you know what you  are doing. That is the second part of the law the First Watcher made: to  guard lest the unwary and the ignorant should bring harm on themselves  and on all men.\"\n\n\n \"We know the stories,\" Var said brusquely. \"In the hollow heart of their  mountain the Ryzgas sleep, as they chose to do when their world  crumbled. But if they are wakened, the mountain will tremble, and the  Ryzgas will come forth.\"\n\n\n \"Do you believe that?\"\n\n\n \"As one believes stories.\"\n\n\n \"It is true,\" said the Watcher heavily. \"In my youth I penetrated  farther into the mountain than anyone before, farther even than did the  First Watcher. I did not see the sleepers, nor will any man until they  come again, but I met their sentries, the sentinel machines that guard  them now as they have for two thousand years. When I had gone that far,  the mountain began to shake, the force that is in the Earth rumbled  below, and I returned in time.\" Now for the first time Var sensed the  power in the old man's look, the power of four hundred years' wisdom.  Var stared down at his hands.\n\n\n \"The Ryzgas also were men,\" said the Watcher. \"But they were such a race  as the world has not seen before or since. There were tyrannies before  the Ryzgas, there was lust for power, and atrocious cruelty; but such  tyranny, power, and cruelty as theirs, had never been known. They ruled  the Earth for four generations, and the Earth was too little for them.  They laid the world waste, stripped it of metals and fuels and bored to  its heart for energy, poisoned its seas and its air with the fume of  their works, wrung its peoples dry for their labor ... and in each of  those four generations they launched a ship of space. They were great  and evil as no other people has been, because they wanted the stars.\n\n\n \"Because of them we must build with dreams instead of iron, and our only  fire is that of the Sun, and even now, two thousand years later, the  Earth is still slowly recovering from the pangs and poison of that age.  If you turn up the sod in the plain where the wild herds graze, you will  find numberless fragments of rusted or corroded metal, bits of glass and  strange plastic substances, debris of artifacts still showing the marks  of their shaping\u2014the scattered wreckage of the things they made. And  we\u2014we too are a remnant, the descendants of the few out of all humanity  that survived when the Ryzgas' world went down in flame and thunder.\n\n\n \"In the last generation of their power the Ryzgas knew by their science  that the race of man would endure them no longer. They made ready their  weapons, they mined the cities and the factories for destruction, making  sure that their works and their knowledge would perish with them.  Meanwhile they redoubled the yoke and the punishments, hastening the  completion of the last of the starships.\n\n\n \"From the memories that the old Watchers have left here, and from the  memories of dead men that still echo in the air, I have gathered a  picture of that world's end. I will show it to you....\" Var and Neena stared, unstirring, with wide vacant eyes, while the old  man wove a dream around them, and the bright ice-cave faded from their  vision, and they saw\u2014\n\n\n Black starless night, a sky of rolling smoke above the greatest city  that was ever built. Only the angry light of fires relieved the city's  darkness\u2014that, and the blue-white lightning flashes that silhouetted  the naked skeletons of buildings and were followed by thunder and a  shaking of the earth.\n\n\n Along lightless streets, half choked with rubble and with the dead,  poured a mad, hating horde. The recurrent flashes lit scarred faces,  naked bodies blackened and maimed from the hell of the workshops where  the Ryzgas' might had been forged, eyes that stared white and half  sightless from the glare of the furnaces, gnarled hands that now at long  last clutched the weapons of the last rebellion\u2014a rebellion without  hope of new life on a world gutted and smoldering from the fulfilment of  the Ryzgas' dream, without slogans other than a cry for blood.\n\n\n Before them death waited around the citadel where the masters still  fought. All round, from the lowest and most poisonous levels of the  shattered city, the slaves swarmed up in their millions. And the  lightning blazed, and the city howled and screamed and burned.\n\n\n Then, unbelievably, the thunder fell silent, and the silence swept  outward like a wave, from ruined street to street. The mouths that had  shouted their wrath were speechless, and the rage-blinded eyes were  lifted in sudden awe. From the center, over the citadel, an immense  white globe soared upward, rising swiftly without sound.\n\n\n They had never seen its like, but they knew. It was the last starship,  and it was leaving.\n\n\n It poised motionless. For an instant the burning city lay mute; then the  millions found voice. Some roared ferocious threats and curses; others  cried desolately\u2014 wait! Then the whole city, the dark tumuli of its buildings and its leaping  fires and tormented faces, and the black sky over it, seemed to twist  and swim, like a scene under water when a great fish sweeps past, and  the ship was gone.\n\n\n The stunned paralysis fell apart in fury. Flame towered over the  citadel. The hordes ran and shrieked again toward the central inferno,  and the city burned and burned.... Var blinked dazedly in the shadowless glow of the ice-cave. His arm  tightened about Neena till she gasped. He was momentarily uncertain that  he and she were real and here, such had been the force of the dream, a  vision of such scope and reality as Var had never seen\u2014no, lived  through\u2014before. With deep respect now he gazed upon the bent old man  who was the Mountain Watcher.\n\n\n \"Some of the Ryzgas took flight to the stars, and some perished on  Earth. But there was a group of them who believed that their time to  rule would come again. These raised a black mountain from the Earth's  heart, and in hollows within it cast themselves into deathless sleep,  their deathless and lifeless sentinels round them, to wait till someone  dare arouse them, or until their chosen time\u2014no one knows surely.\n\n\n \"I have told you the story you know, and have shown you a glimpse of the  old time, because I must make sure that you do not approach the mountain  in ignorance. Our world is unwise and sometimes evil, full of arrogance,  folly, and passion that are in the nature of man. Yet it is a happy  world, compared to that the Ryzgas made and will make again.\"\n\n\n The Watcher eyed them speculatively. \"Before all,\" he said finally,  \"this is a world where you are free to risk wakening the old tyrants, if  in your own judgment your great need renders the chance worth taking.\"\n\n\n Neena pressed her face against Var's shoulder, hiding her eyes. In her  mind as it groped for his there was a confusion of horror and pity. Var  looked grimly at the Watcher, and would have spoken; but the Watcher  seemed suddenly a very long way off, and Var could no longer feel his  own limbs, his face was a numb mask. Dully he heard the old man say,  \"You are tired. Best sleep until morning.\"\n\n\n Var strove to cry out that there was no time, that Groz was near and  that sleep was for infants and the aged, but his intention sank and  drowned under wave upon wave of unconquerable languor. The bright cave  swam and dissolved; his eyelids closed. Var woke. Daylight glimmered through the ice of the cave mouth. He had  been unconscious, helpless, for hours! At the thought of that, panic  gripped him. He had not slept since childhood, and he had forgotten how  it was.\n\n\n He came to his feet in one quick movement, realizing in that action that  sleep had refreshed his mind and body\u2014realizing also that a footstep  had wakened him. Across the cave he faced a young man who watched him  coolly with dark piercing eyes that were familiar though he did not know  the face.\n\n\n Neena sat up and stifled a cry of fright. Var growled, \"Who are you?  Where's the Watcher?\"\n\n\n The other flashed white teeth in a smile. \"I'm the Watcher,\" he  answered. \"Often I become a youth at morning, and relax into age as the  day passes. A foolish amusement, no doubt, but amusements are few here.\"\n\n\n \"You made us fall asleep. Groz will be on us\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Groz and his people could not detect your thoughts as you slept. They  were all night chasing elusive dreams on the high ridges, miles away.\"\n\n\n Var passed a hand across bewildered eyes. Neena said softly, \"Thank you,  Watcher.\"\n\n\n \"Don't thank me. I take no sides in your valley feuds. But now you are  rested, your minds are clear. Do you still mean to go on to the Ryzga  mountain?\"\n\n\n Not looking at the Watcher, Var muttered unsteadily, \"We have no  alternative.\"\n\n\n There was a liquid tinkling as the ice-curtain collapsed; the fresh  breeze of morning swept into the cave. The youth beckoned to them, and  they followed him outside.\n\n\n The glacial slope on which the cavern opened faced toward the mountain.  It rose black and forbidding in the dawn as it had by sunset. To right  and left of it, the grand cliffs, ocher and red, were lit splendidly by  the morning sun, but the mountain of the Ryzgas drank in the light and  gave nothing back.\n\n\n Below their feet the slope fell away into an opaque sea of fog, filling  a mile-wide gorge. There was a sound of turbulent water, of a river  dashed from rock to rock in its struggle toward the plain, but the  curling fog hid everything.\n\n\n \"You have an alternative,\" said the Watcher crisply. The two took their  eyes from the black mountain and gazed at him in sudden hope, but his  face was unsmiling. \"It is this. You, Var, can flee up the canyon to the  north, by a way I will show you, disguising your thoughts and masking  your presence as well as you are able, while the girl goes in the other  direction, southward, without seeking to conceal herself. Your pursuers  will be deceived and follow her, and by the time they catch her it will  be too late for them to overtake Var.\"\n\n\n That possibility had not occurred to them at all. Var and Neena looked  at one another. Then by common consent they blended their minds into  one.\n\n\n They thought, in the warm intimacy of unreserved understanding: \" It  would work: I-you would make the sacrifice of shame and mockery\u2014yet  these can be borne\u2014that I-you might be saved from death\u2014which is alone  irreparable.... But to become I and you again\u2014that cannot be  borne. \"\n\n\n They said in unison, \"No. Not that.\"\n\n\n The Watcher's face did not change. He said gravely, \"Very well. I will  give you what knowledge I have that may help you when you enter the  Ryzga mountain.\"\n\n\n Quickly, he impressed on them what he had learned of the structure of  the mountain and of its guardian machines. Var closed his eyes, a little  dizzied by the rapid flood of detail.\n\n\n \"You are ready to go,\" said the Watcher. He spoke aloud, and his voice  was cracked and harsh. Var opened his eyes in surprise, and saw that the  Watcher had become again the hoary ancient of last night.\n\n\n Var felt a twinge of unfamiliar emotion; only by its echo in Neena's  mind did he recognize it as a sense of guilt. He said stiffly, \"You  don't blame us?\"\n\n\n \"You have taken life in your own hands,\" rasped the Watcher. \"Who does  that needs no blessing and feels no curse. Go!\" They groped through the fog above blank abysses that hid the snarling  river, crept hand in hand, sharing their strength, across unstable dream  bridges from crag to crag. Groz and his pack, in their numbers, would  cross the gorge more surely and swiftly. When Var and Neena set foot at  last on the cindery slope of the great volcanic cone, they sensed that  the pursuit already halved their lead.\n\n\n They stood high on the side of the Ryzga mountain, and gazed at the  doorway. It was an opaque yet penetrable well of darkness, opening into  the face of a lava cliff, closed only by an intangible curtain\u2014so  little had the Ryzgas feared those who might assail them in their sleep.\n\n\n Var sent his thoughts probing beyond the curtain, listened intently,  head thrown back, to their echoes that returned. The tunnel beyond  slanted steeply downward. Var's hands moved, molding a radiant globe  from the feeble sunshine that straggled through the fog-bank. With an  abrupt motion he hurled it. The sun-globe vanished, as if the darkness  had drunk it up, but though sight did not serve they both sensed that it  had passed through to light up the depths beyond. For within the  mountain something snapped suddenly alert\u2014something alive yet not  living, seeing yet blind. They felt light-sensitive cells tingle in  response, felt electric currents sting along buried, long-idle  circuits....\n\n\n The two stood shivering together.\n\n\n The morning wind stirred, freshening, the fog lifted a little, and they  heard a great voice crying, \"There they are!\"\n\n\n Var and Neena turned. Far out in the sea of fog, on a dream bridge that  they could not see, stood Groz. He shook the staff he carried. It was  too far to discern the rage that must contort his features, but the  thought he hurled at them was a soundless bellow: \"Young fools! I've  caught you now!\"\n\n\n Behind Groz the figures of his followers loomed up as striding shadows.  Neena's hand tightened on Var's. Var sent a thought of defiance: \"Go  back! Or you'll drive us to enter the mountain!\"\n\n\n Groz seemed to hesitate. Then he swung his staff up like a weapon, and  for the two on the mountainside the world turned upside down, the  mountain's black shoulder hung inverted above them and the dizzy gulf of  sky was beneath. Var fought for footing with his balance gone, feeling  Neena reel against him until, summoning all his strength, he broke the  grip of the illusion and the world seemed to right itself. The mist  billowed again and Groz was out of sight, but they could hear him  exhorting his men to haste.\n\n\n Neena's face was deadly pale and her lips trembled, but her urgent  whisper said, \"Come on!\"\n\n\n Together they plunged into the curtain of darkness. At Var's thought command Neena froze instantly. \"Feel that!\" he  muttered, and she, listening, sensed it too: the infinitesimal trickle  of currents behind what appeared to be a blank tunnel wall, a rising  potential that seemed to whisper Ready ... ready.... The sun-globe floated behind them, casting light before them down the  featureless tunnel that sloped always toward the mountain's heart. Var  summoned it, and it drifted ahead, a dozen feet, a little more\u2014\n\n\n Between wall and wall a blinding spindle of flame sprang into being,  pulsed briefly with radiant energy that pained the eyes, and went out.  The immaterial globe of light danced on before them.\n\n\n \"Forward, before the charge builds up again!\" said Var. A few feet  further on, they stumbled over a pile of charred bones. Someone else had  made it only this far. It was farther than the Watcher had gone into  these uncharted regions, and only the utmost alertness of mind and sense  had saved them from death in traps like this. But as yet the way was not  blocked....\n\n\n Then they felt the mountain begin to tremble. A very faint and remote  vibration at first, then an increasingly potent shuddering of the floor  under their feet and the walls around them. Somewhere far below immense  energies were stirring for the first time in centuries. The power that  was in the Earth was rising; great wheels commenced to turn, the  mechanical servitors of the Ryzgas woke one by one and began to make  ready, while their masters yet slept, for the moment of rebirth that  might be near at hand.\n\n\n From behind, up the tunnel, came a clear involuntary thought of dismay,  then a directed thought, echoing and ghostly in the confinement of the  dark burrow:\n\n\n \" Stop! \u2014before you go too far!\"\n\n\n Var faced that way and thought coldly: \"Only if you return and let us go  free.\"\n\n\n In the black reaches of the shaft his will groped for and locked with  that of Groz, like the grip of two strong wrestlers. In that grip each  knew with finality that the other's stubbornness matched his own\u2014that  neither would yield, though the mountain above them and the world  outside should crumble to ruin around them.\n\n\n \"Follow us, then!\"\n\n\n They plunged deeper into the mountain. And the shaking of the mountain  increased with every step, its vibrations became sound, and its sound  was like that of the terrible city which they had seen in the dream.  Through the slow-rolling thunder of the hidden machines seemed to echo  the death-cries of a billion slaves, the despair of all flesh and blood  before their monstrous and inhuman power.\n\n\n Without warning, lights went on. Blinking in their glare, Var and Neena  saw that fifty paces before them the way opened out into a great rounded  room that was likewise ablaze with light. Cautiously they crept forward  to the threshold of that chamber at the mountain's heart.\n\n\n Its roof was vaulted; its circular walls were lined with panels studded  with gleaming control buttons, levers, colored lights. As they watched  light flicked on and off in changing patterns, registering the  progressive changes in the vast complex of mechanisms for which this  must be the central control station. Behind those boards circuits opened  and closed in bewildering confusion; the two invaders felt the rapid  shifting of magnetic fields, the fury of electrons boiling in vacuum....\n\n\n For long moments they forgot the pursuit, forgot everything in wonder at  this place whose remotest like they had never seen in the simplicity of  their machineless culture. In all the brilliant space there was no life.  They looked at one another, the same thought coming to both at once:  perhaps, after two thousand years, the masters were dead after all, and  only the machines remained? As if irresistibly drawn, they stepped over  the threshold.\n\n\n There was a clang of metal like a signal. Halfway up the wall opposite,  above a narrow ramp that descended between the instrument panels, a  massive doorway swung wide, and in its opening a figure stood.\n\n\n Var and Neena huddled frozenly, half expecting each instant to be their  last. And the Ryzga too stood motionless, looking down at them. He was a man of middle height and stocky build, clad in a garment of  changing colors, of fabric delicate as dream-stuff. In his right hand,  with the care one uses with a weapon, he grasped a gleaming metal tube;  his other hand rested as for support against the frame of the doorway.  That, and his movements when he came slowly down the ramp toward them,  conveyed a queer suggestion of weariness or weakness, as if he were yet  not wholly roused from his two millenia of slumber. But the Ryzga's  manner and his mind radiated a consciousness of power, a pride and  assurance of self that smote them like a numbing blow.\n\n\n With a new shock, Var realized that the Ryzga's thoughts were quite  open. They had a terse, disconnected quality that was strange and  unsettling, and in part they were couched in alien and unintelligible  symbols. But there was no block. Apparently the Ryzga felt no need to  close his mind in the presence of inferior creatures....\n\n\n He paused with his back to the central control panel, and studied the  interlopers with the dispassionate gaze of a scientist examining a new,  but not novel, species of insect. His thoughts seemed to click, like  metal parts of a mechanism falling into places prepared for them. The  image occurred oddly to Var, to whom such a comparison would ordinarily  have been totally strange.\n\n\n \"Culture: late barbarism. Handwork of high quality\u2014good. Physically  excellent stock....\" There was a complicated and incomprehensible  schemata of numbers and abstract forms. \"The time: two thousand  years\u2014more progress might have been expected, if any survivors at all  initially postulated; but this will do. The pessimists were mistaken. We  can begin again.\" Then, startlingly super-imposed on the cool  progression of logical thought, came a wave of raw emotion, devastating  in its force. It was a lustful image of a world once more obedient,  crawling, laboring to do the Ryzgas' will\u2014 toward the stars, the  stars! The icy calculation resumed: \"Immobilize these and the ones  indicated in the passage above. Then wake the rest....\"\n\n\n Var was staring in fascination at the Ryzga's face. It was a face formed  by the custom of unquestioned command; yet it was lined by a deeply  ingrained weariness, the signs of premature age\u2014denied, overridden by  the driving will they had sensed a moment earlier. It was a sick man's  face.\n\n\n The Ryzga's final thought clicked into place: Decision! He turned  toward the switchboard behind him, reaching with practised certainty for  one spot upon it.\n\n\n Neena screamed.\n\n\n Between the Ryzga and the control panel a nightmare shape reared up  seven feet tall, flapping black amorphous limbs and flashing red eyes  and white fangs. The Ryzga recoiled, and the weapon in his hand came up.  There was an instantaneous glare like heat lightning, and the monster  crumpled in on itself, twitched briefly and vanished.\n\n\n But in that moment a light of inspiration had flashed upon Var, and it  remained. As the Ryzga stretched out his hand again, Var acted. The  Ryzga froze, teetering off balance and almost falling, as a numbing grip  closed down on all his motor nerves.\n\n\n Holding that grip, Var strode across the floor and looked straight into  the Ryzga's frantic eyes. They glared back at him with such hatred and  such evil that for an instant he almost faltered. But the Ryzga's  efforts, as he strove to free himself from the neural hold, were as  misdirected and unavailing as those of a child who has not learned to  wrestle with the mind.\n\n\n Var had guessed right. When Neena in her terror had flung a dream  monster into the Ryzga's way\u2014a mere child's bogey out of a fairy  tale\u2014the Ryzga had not recognized it as such, but had taken it for a  real being. Var laughed aloud, and with great care, as one communicates  with an infant, he projected his thoughts into the other's mind. \"There  will be no new beginning for you in our world, Ryzga! In two thousand  years, we've learned some new things. Now at last I understand why you  built so many machines, such complicated arrangements of matter and  energy to do simple tasks\u2014it was because you knew no other way.\"\n\n\n Behind the hate-filled eyes the cold brain tried to reason still.  \"Barbarians...? Our party was wrong after all. After us the machine  civilization could never rise again, because it was a fire that consumed  its fuel. After us man could not survive on the Earth, because the  conditions that made him great were gone. The survivors must be  something else\u2014capacities undeveloped by our science\u2014after us the end  of man, the beginning.... But those of us who chose to die were right.\"\n\n\n The tide of hate and sick desire rose up to drown all coherence. The  Ryzga made a savage, wholly futile effort to lift the weapon in his  paralyzed hand. Then his eyes rolled upward, and abruptly he went limp  and fell in a heap, like a mechanical doll whose motive power has  failed.\n\n\n Var felt Neena beside him, and drew her close. As she sobbed her relief,  he continued to look down absently at the dead man. When at last he  raised his head, he saw that the drama's end had had a further audience.  In the outer doorway, backed by his clansmen, stood Groz, gazing first  in stupefaction at the fallen Ryzga, then with something like awe at  Var.\n\n\n Var eyed him for a long moment; then he smiled, and asked, \"Well, Groz?  Is our feud finished, or does your ambition for a worthy son-in-law go  beyond the conqueror of the Ryzgas?\" ",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Dark was the Ryzga mountain and forbidding; steep were its  cliffs and sheer its crevasses. But its outward perils could not compare  with the Ryzgas themselves, who slept within, ready to wake and  conquer.... At sunset they were in sight of the Ryzga mountain. Strangely it towered  among the cliffs and snow-slopes of the surrounding ranges: an immense  and repellently geometric cone, black, its sides blood-tinted by the  dying sun.\n\n\n Neena shivered, even though the surrounding cold could not reach her.  The ice-wind blew from the glacier, but Var's love was round her as a  warming cloak, a cloak that glowed softly golden in the deepening  twilight, even as her love was about him.\n\n\n Var said, \"The Watcher's cave should be three miles beyond this pass.\"  He stood rigid, trying to catch an echo of the Watcher's thoughts, but  there was nothing. Perhaps the old man was resting. From the other  direction, the long way that they two had come, it was not difficult to  sense the thought of Groz. That thought was powerful, and heavy with  vengeance.\n\n\n \"Hurry,\" said Neena. \"They're closer than they were an hour ago.\"\n\n\n She was beautiful and defiant, facing the red sunset and the black  mountain. Var sensed her fear, and the love that had conquered it. He  felt a wave of tenderness and bitterness. For him she had come to this.  For the flame that had sprung between them at the Truce of New Grass,  she had challenged the feud of their peoples and had left her home, to  follow him. Now, if her father and his kinsmen overtook them, it would  be death for Var, and for Neena living shame. Which of the two was worse  was no longer a simple problem to Var, who had grown much older in the  last days.\n\n\n \"Wait,\" he commanded. While she waited he spun a dream, attaching it to  the crags that loomed over the pass, and to the frozen ground underfoot.  It was black night, as it would really be when Groz and his henchmen  reached this place; lurid fire spewed from the Ryzga mountain, and  strange lights dipped above it; and for good measure there was an  avalanche in the dream, and hideous beasts rushed snapping and ravening  from the crevices of the rock.\n\n\n \"Oh!\" cried Neena in involuntary alarm.\n\n\n Var sighed, shaking his head. \"It won't hold them for long, but it's the  best I can do now. Come on.\"\n\n\n There was no path. Now they were descending the steeper face of the  sierra, and the way led over bottomless crevasses, sheer drops and sheer  ascents, sheets of traitorous glare ice. Place after place had to be  crossed on the air, and both grew weary with the effort such crossings  cost. They hoarded their strength, helping one another; one alone might  never have won through.\n\n\n It was starry night already when they saw the light from the Watcher's  cave. The light shone watery and dim from beneath the hoary back of the  glacier, and as they came nearer they saw why: the cave entrance was  sealed by a sheet of ice, a frozen waterfall that fell motionless from  the rocks above. They heard no sound.\n\n\n The two young people stared for a long minute, intrigued and fearful.  Both had heard of this place, and the ancient who lived there to keep  watch on the Ryzga mountain, as a part of the oldest legends of their  childhood; but neither had been here before.\n\n\n But this was no time for shyness. Var eyed the ice-curtain closely to  make sure that it was real, not dream-stuff; then he struck it boldly  with his fist. It shattered and fell in a rain of splinters, sparkling  in the light that poured from within. They felt the Watcher rouse, heard his footsteps, and finally saw him\u2014a  shrunken old man, white-haired, with a lined beardless face. The sight  of him, more marred by age than anyone they had ever seen before, was  disappointing. They had expected something more\u2014an ancient giant, a  tower of wisdom and strength. The Watcher was four hundred years old;  beside him even Groz, who had always seemed so ancient, was like a boy.\n\n\n The Watcher peered at them in turn. \"Welcome,\" he said in a cracked  voice. He did not speak again; the rest of his conversation was in  thought only. \"Welcome indeed. I am too much alone here.\"\n\n\n \"You were asleep!\" said Var. Shock made his thought accusing, though he  had not meant to be.\n\n\n The old man grinned toothlessly. \"Never fear. Asleep or awake, I watch.  Come in! You're letting in the wind.\"\n\n\n Inside the cave it was warm as summer. Var saw with some surprise that  all the walls were sheathed in ice\u2014warm to the touch, bound fast  against melting by the Watcher's will. Light blazed in reflections from  the ice walls, till there was no shadow in the place. Behind them began  a tinkling of falling water, thawed from the glacial ridges above to  descend sheet-wise over the cave mouth, freezing as it fell into  lengthening icicles. The old man gazed at his work for a moment, then  turned questioningly to the young pair.\n\n\n \"We need a little rest out of the cold,\" said Var. \"And food, if you can  spare it. We're pursued.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes. You shall have what I can give you. Make yourselves  comfortable, and in one minute.... Pursued, eh? A pity. I see the world  is as bad as it was when I was last in it.\"\n\n\n Hot food and drink were before them almost at once. The Watcher regarded  them with compassion as their eyes brightened and some of the shadow of  weariness lifted from them. \"You have stolen your enemy's daughter, no  doubt, young man? Such things happened when I was young.\"\n\n\n Warming to the old man now, Var sketched his and Neena's history  briefly. \"We should have been safe among my people by now. And before  very long, I'm sure, I would have performed some deed which Groz would  recognize as a worthy exploit, and would thus have healed the feud  between our families. But our flight was found out too soon. They cut us  off and forced us into the mountains, and now they are only a few hours  behind us.\"\n\n\n \"A pity, indeed. I would like to help you\u2014but, you understand, I am the  Mountain Watcher. I must be above feuds and families.\"\n\n\n Var nodded somberly, thinking that an old recluse would in any case be  able to do little for them against Groz and his violent kinsfolk.\n\n\n \"And what will you do now?\"\n\n\n Var grinned mirthlessly. \"We haven't much choice, since they're  overtaking us. I have only one idea left: we can go where Groz may fear  to follow us.\"\n\n\n \"To the mountain, you mean.\"\n\n\n \"And into it, if need be.\"\n\n\n The Watcher was broodingly silent; his eyes shifted to Neena, where she  nestled by Var's side. He asked, \"And you\u2014are you willing to follow  your lover in this?\"\n\n\n Neena returned his gaze without flinching; then she looked sidelong at  Var, and her lips curled with a proud and tender mockery. \"Follow? Why,  I will lead, if his courage should fail him.\" The old man said, \"It is no part of my duty to dissuade you from this  thing. You are free persons. But I must be sure that you know what you  are doing. That is the second part of the law the First Watcher made: to  guard lest the unwary and the ignorant should bring harm on themselves  and on all men.\"\n\n\n \"We know the stories,\" Var said brusquely. \"In the hollow heart of their  mountain the Ryzgas sleep, as they chose to do when their world  crumbled. But if they are wakened, the mountain will tremble, and the  Ryzgas will come forth.\"\n\n\n \"Do you believe that?\"\n\n\n \"As one believes stories.\"\n\n\n \"It is true,\" said the Watcher heavily. \"In my youth I penetrated  farther into the mountain than anyone before, farther even than did the  First Watcher. I did not see the sleepers, nor will any man until they  come again, but I met their sentries, the sentinel machines that guard  them now as they have for two thousand years. When I had gone that far,  the mountain began to shake, the force that is in the Earth rumbled  below, and I returned in time.\" Now for the first time Var sensed the  power in the old man's look, the power of four hundred years' wisdom.  Var stared down at his hands.\n\n\n \"The Ryzgas also were men,\" said the Watcher. \"But they were such a race  as the world has not seen before or since. There were tyrannies before  the Ryzgas, there was lust for power, and atrocious cruelty; but such  tyranny, power, and cruelty as theirs, had never been known. They ruled  the Earth for four generations, and the Earth was too little for them.  They laid the world waste, stripped it of metals and fuels and bored to  its heart for energy, poisoned its seas and its air with the fume of  their works, wrung its peoples dry for their labor ... and in each of  those four generations they launched a ship of space. They were great  and evil as no other people has been, because they wanted the stars.\n\n\n \"Because of them we must build with dreams instead of iron, and our only  fire is that of the Sun, and even now, two thousand years later, the  Earth is still slowly recovering from the pangs and poison of that age.  If you turn up the sod in the plain where the wild herds graze, you will  find numberless fragments of rusted or corroded metal, bits of glass and  strange plastic substances, debris of artifacts still showing the marks  of their shaping\u2014the scattered wreckage of the things they made. And  we\u2014we too are a remnant, the descendants of the few out of all humanity  that survived when the Ryzgas' world went down in flame and thunder.\n\n\n \"In the last generation of their power the Ryzgas knew by their science  that the race of man would endure them no longer. They made ready their  weapons, they mined the cities and the factories for destruction, making  sure that their works and their knowledge would perish with them.  Meanwhile they redoubled the yoke and the punishments, hastening the  completion of the last of the starships.\n\n\n \"From the memories that the old Watchers have left here, and from the  memories of dead men that still echo in the air, I have gathered a  picture of that world's end. I will show it to you....\" Var and Neena stared, unstirring, with wide vacant eyes, while the old  man wove a dream around them, and the bright ice-cave faded from their  vision, and they saw\u2014\n\n\n Black starless night, a sky of rolling smoke above the greatest city  that was ever built. Only the angry light of fires relieved the city's  darkness\u2014that, and the blue-white lightning flashes that silhouetted  the naked skeletons of buildings and were followed by thunder and a  shaking of the earth.\n\n\n Along lightless streets, half choked with rubble and with the dead,  poured a mad, hating horde. The recurrent flashes lit scarred faces,  naked bodies blackened and maimed from the hell of the workshops where  the Ryzgas' might had been forged, eyes that stared white and half  sightless from the glare of the furnaces, gnarled hands that now at long  last clutched the weapons of the last rebellion\u2014a rebellion without  hope of new life on a world gutted and smoldering from the fulfilment of  the Ryzgas' dream, without slogans other than a cry for blood.\n\n\n Before them death waited around the citadel where the masters still  fought. All round, from the lowest and most poisonous levels of the  shattered city, the slaves swarmed up in their millions. And the  lightning blazed, and the city howled and screamed and burned.\n\n\n Then, unbelievably, the thunder fell silent, and the silence swept  outward like a wave, from ruined street to street. The mouths that had  shouted their wrath were speechless, and the rage-blinded eyes were  lifted in sudden awe. From the center, over the citadel, an immense  white globe soared upward, rising swiftly without sound.\n\n\n They had never seen its like, but they knew. It was the last starship,  and it was leaving.\n\n\n It poised motionless. For an instant the burning city lay mute; then the  millions found voice. Some roared ferocious threats and curses; others  cried desolately\u2014 wait! Then the whole city, the dark tumuli of its buildings and its leaping  fires and tormented faces, and the black sky over it, seemed to twist  and swim, like a scene under water when a great fish sweeps past, and  the ship was gone.\n\n\n The stunned paralysis fell apart in fury. Flame towered over the  citadel. The hordes ran and shrieked again toward the central inferno,  and the city burned and burned.... Var blinked dazedly in the shadowless glow of the ice-cave. His arm  tightened about Neena till she gasped. He was momentarily uncertain that  he and she were real and here, such had been the force of the dream, a  vision of such scope and reality as Var had never seen\u2014no, lived  through\u2014before. With deep respect now he gazed upon the bent old man  who was the Mountain Watcher.\n\n\n \"Some of the Ryzgas took flight to the stars, and some perished on  Earth. But there was a group of them who believed that their time to  rule would come again. These raised a black mountain from the Earth's  heart, and in hollows within it cast themselves into deathless sleep,  their deathless and lifeless sentinels round them, to wait till someone  dare arouse them, or until their chosen time\u2014no one knows surely.\n\n\n \"I have told you the story you know, and have shown you a glimpse of the  old time, because I must make sure that you do not approach the mountain  in ignorance. Our world is unwise and sometimes evil, full of arrogance,  folly, and passion that are in the nature of man. Yet it is a happy  world, compared to that the Ryzgas made and will make again.\"\n\n\n The Watcher eyed them speculatively. \"Before all,\" he said finally,  \"this is a world where you are free to risk wakening the old tyrants, if  in your own judgment your great need renders the chance worth taking.\"\n\n\n Neena pressed her face against Var's shoulder, hiding her eyes. In her  mind as it groped for his there was a confusion of horror and pity. Var  looked grimly at the Watcher, and would have spoken; but the Watcher  seemed suddenly a very long way off, and Var could no longer feel his  own limbs, his face was a numb mask. Dully he heard the old man say,  \"You are tired. Best sleep until morning.\"\n\n\n Var strove to cry out that there was no time, that Groz was near and  that sleep was for infants and the aged, but his intention sank and  drowned under wave upon wave of unconquerable languor. The bright cave  swam and dissolved; his eyelids closed. Var woke. Daylight glimmered through the ice of the cave mouth. He had  been unconscious, helpless, for hours! At the thought of that, panic  gripped him. He had not slept since childhood, and he had forgotten how  it was.\n\n\n He came to his feet in one quick movement, realizing in that action that  sleep had refreshed his mind and body\u2014realizing also that a footstep  had wakened him. Across the cave he faced a young man who watched him  coolly with dark piercing eyes that were familiar though he did not know  the face.\n\n\n Neena sat up and stifled a cry of fright. Var growled, \"Who are you?  Where's the Watcher?\"\n\n\n The other flashed white teeth in a smile. \"I'm the Watcher,\" he  answered. \"Often I become a youth at morning, and relax into age as the  day passes. A foolish amusement, no doubt, but amusements are few here.\"\n\n\n \"You made us fall asleep. Groz will be on us\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Groz and his people could not detect your thoughts as you slept. They  were all night chasing elusive dreams on the high ridges, miles away.\"\n\n\n Var passed a hand across bewildered eyes. Neena said softly, \"Thank you,  Watcher.\"\n\n\n \"Don't thank me. I take no sides in your valley feuds. But now you are  rested, your minds are clear. Do you still mean to go on to the Ryzga  mountain?\"\n\n\n Not looking at the Watcher, Var muttered unsteadily, \"We have no  alternative.\"\n\n\n There was a liquid tinkling as the ice-curtain collapsed; the fresh  breeze of morning swept into the cave. The youth beckoned to them, and  they followed him outside.\n\n\n The glacial slope on which the cavern opened faced toward the mountain.  It rose black and forbidding in the dawn as it had by sunset. To right  and left of it, the grand cliffs, ocher and red, were lit splendidly by  the morning sun, but the mountain of the Ryzgas drank in the light and  gave nothing back.\n\n\n Below their feet the slope fell away into an opaque sea of fog, filling  a mile-wide gorge. There was a sound of turbulent water, of a river  dashed from rock to rock in its struggle toward the plain, but the  curling fog hid everything.\n\n\n \"You have an alternative,\" said the Watcher crisply. The two took their  eyes from the black mountain and gazed at him in sudden hope, but his  face was unsmiling. \"It is this. You, Var, can flee up the canyon to the  north, by a way I will show you, disguising your thoughts and masking  your presence as well as you are able, while the girl goes in the other  direction, southward, without seeking to conceal herself. Your pursuers  will be deceived and follow her, and by the time they catch her it will  be too late for them to overtake Var.\"\n\n\n That possibility had not occurred to them at all. Var and Neena looked  at one another. Then by common consent they blended their minds into  one.\n\n\n They thought, in the warm intimacy of unreserved understanding: \" It  would work: I-you would make the sacrifice of shame and mockery\u2014yet  these can be borne\u2014that I-you might be saved from death\u2014which is alone  irreparable.... But to become I and you again\u2014that cannot be  borne. \"\n\n\n They said in unison, \"No. Not that.\"\n\n\n The Watcher's face did not change. He said gravely, \"Very well. I will  give you what knowledge I have that may help you when you enter the  Ryzga mountain.\"\n\n\n Quickly, he impressed on them what he had learned of the structure of  the mountain and of its guardian machines. Var closed his eyes, a little  dizzied by the rapid flood of detail.\n\n\n \"You are ready to go,\" said the Watcher. He spoke aloud, and his voice  was cracked and harsh. Var opened his eyes in surprise, and saw that the  Watcher had become again the hoary ancient of last night.\n\n\n Var felt a twinge of unfamiliar emotion; only by its echo in Neena's  mind did he recognize it as a sense of guilt. He said stiffly, \"You  don't blame us?\"\n\n\n \"You have taken life in your own hands,\" rasped the Watcher. \"Who does  that needs no blessing and feels no curse. Go!\" They groped through the fog above blank abysses that hid the snarling  river, crept hand in hand, sharing their strength, across unstable dream  bridges from crag to crag. Groz and his pack, in their numbers, would  cross the gorge more surely and swiftly. When Var and Neena set foot at  last on the cindery slope of the great volcanic cone, they sensed that  the pursuit already halved their lead.\n\n\n They stood high on the side of the Ryzga mountain, and gazed at the  doorway. It was an opaque yet penetrable well of darkness, opening into  the face of a lava cliff, closed only by an intangible curtain\u2014so  little had the Ryzgas feared those who might assail them in their sleep.\n\n\n Var sent his thoughts probing beyond the curtain, listened intently,  head thrown back, to their echoes that returned. The tunnel beyond  slanted steeply downward. Var's hands moved, molding a radiant globe  from the feeble sunshine that straggled through the fog-bank. With an  abrupt motion he hurled it. The sun-globe vanished, as if the darkness  had drunk it up, but though sight did not serve they both sensed that it  had passed through to light up the depths beyond. For within the  mountain something snapped suddenly alert\u2014something alive yet not  living, seeing yet blind. They felt light-sensitive cells tingle in  response, felt electric currents sting along buried, long-idle  circuits....\n\n\n The two stood shivering together.\n\n\n The morning wind stirred, freshening, the fog lifted a little, and they  heard a great voice crying, \"There they are!\"\n\n\n Var and Neena turned. Far out in the sea of fog, on a dream bridge that  they could not see, stood Groz. He shook the staff he carried. It was  too far to discern the rage that must contort his features, but the  thought he hurled at them was a soundless bellow: \"Young fools! I've  caught you now!\"\n\n\n Behind Groz the figures of his followers loomed up as striding shadows.  Neena's hand tightened on Var's. Var sent a thought of defiance: \"Go  back! Or you'll drive us to enter the mountain!\"\n\n\n Groz seemed to hesitate. Then he swung his staff up like a weapon, and  for the two on the mountainside the world turned upside down, the  mountain's black shoulder hung inverted above them and the dizzy gulf of  sky was beneath. Var fought for footing with his balance gone, feeling  Neena reel against him until, summoning all his strength, he broke the  grip of the illusion and the world seemed to right itself. The mist  billowed again and Groz was out of sight, but they could hear him  exhorting his men to haste.\n\n\n Neena's face was deadly pale and her lips trembled, but her urgent  whisper said, \"Come on!\"\n\n\n Together they plunged into the curtain of darkness. At Var's thought command Neena froze instantly. \"Feel that!\" he  muttered, and she, listening, sensed it too: the infinitesimal trickle  of currents behind what appeared to be a blank tunnel wall, a rising  potential that seemed to whisper Ready ... ready.... The sun-globe floated behind them, casting light before them down the  featureless tunnel that sloped always toward the mountain's heart. Var  summoned it, and it drifted ahead, a dozen feet, a little more\u2014\n\n\n Between wall and wall a blinding spindle of flame sprang into being,  pulsed briefly with radiant energy that pained the eyes, and went out.  The immaterial globe of light danced on before them.\n\n\n \"Forward, before the charge builds up again!\" said Var. A few feet  further on, they stumbled over a pile of charred bones. Someone else had  made it only this far. It was farther than the Watcher had gone into  these uncharted regions, and only the utmost alertness of mind and sense  had saved them from death in traps like this. But as yet the way was not  blocked....\n\n\n Then they felt the mountain begin to tremble. A very faint and remote  vibration at first, then an increasingly potent shuddering of the floor  under their feet and the walls around them. Somewhere far below immense  energies were stirring for the first time in centuries. The power that  was in the Earth was rising; great wheels commenced to turn, the  mechanical servitors of the Ryzgas woke one by one and began to make  ready, while their masters yet slept, for the moment of rebirth that  might be near at hand.\n\n\n From behind, up the tunnel, came a clear involuntary thought of dismay,  then a directed thought, echoing and ghostly in the confinement of the  dark burrow:\n\n\n \" Stop! \u2014before you go too far!\"\n\n\n Var faced that way and thought coldly: \"Only if you return and let us go  free.\"\n\n\n In the black reaches of the shaft his will groped for and locked with  that of Groz, like the grip of two strong wrestlers. In that grip each  knew with finality that the other's stubbornness matched his own\u2014that  neither would yield, though the mountain above them and the world  outside should crumble to ruin around them.\n\n\n \"Follow us, then!\"\n\n\n They plunged deeper into the mountain. And the shaking of the mountain  increased with every step, its vibrations became sound, and its sound  was like that of the terrible city which they had seen in the dream.  Through the slow-rolling thunder of the hidden machines seemed to echo  the death-cries of a billion slaves, the despair of all flesh and blood  before their monstrous and inhuman power.\n\n\n Without warning, lights went on. Blinking in their glare, Var and Neena  saw that fifty paces before them the way opened out into a great rounded  room that was likewise ablaze with light. Cautiously they crept forward  to the threshold of that chamber at the mountain's heart.\n\n\n Its roof was vaulted; its circular walls were lined with panels studded  with gleaming control buttons, levers, colored lights. As they watched  light flicked on and off in changing patterns, registering the  progressive changes in the vast complex of mechanisms for which this  must be the central control station. Behind those boards circuits opened  and closed in bewildering confusion; the two invaders felt the rapid  shifting of magnetic fields, the fury of electrons boiling in vacuum....\n\n\n For long moments they forgot the pursuit, forgot everything in wonder at  this place whose remotest like they had never seen in the simplicity of  their machineless culture. In all the brilliant space there was no life.  They looked at one another, the same thought coming to both at once:  perhaps, after two thousand years, the masters were dead after all, and  only the machines remained? As if irresistibly drawn, they stepped over  the threshold.\n\n\n There was a clang of metal like a signal. Halfway up the wall opposite,  above a narrow ramp that descended between the instrument panels, a  massive doorway swung wide, and in its opening a figure stood.\n\n\n Var and Neena huddled frozenly, half expecting each instant to be their  last. And the Ryzga too stood motionless, looking down at them. He was a man of middle height and stocky build, clad in a garment of  changing colors, of fabric delicate as dream-stuff. In his right hand,  with the care one uses with a weapon, he grasped a gleaming metal tube;  his other hand rested as for support against the frame of the doorway.  That, and his movements when he came slowly down the ramp toward them,  conveyed a queer suggestion of weariness or weakness, as if he were yet  not wholly roused from his two millenia of slumber. But the Ryzga's  manner and his mind radiated a consciousness of power, a pride and  assurance of self that smote them like a numbing blow.\n\n\n With a new shock, Var realized that the Ryzga's thoughts were quite  open. They had a terse, disconnected quality that was strange and  unsettling, and in part they were couched in alien and unintelligible  symbols. But there was no block. Apparently the Ryzga felt no need to  close his mind in the presence of inferior creatures....\n\n\n He paused with his back to the central control panel, and studied the  interlopers with the dispassionate gaze of a scientist examining a new,  but not novel, species of insect. His thoughts seemed to click, like  metal parts of a mechanism falling into places prepared for them. The  image occurred oddly to Var, to whom such a comparison would ordinarily  have been totally strange.\n\n\n \"Culture: late barbarism. Handwork of high quality\u2014good. Physically  excellent stock....\" There was a complicated and incomprehensible  schemata of numbers and abstract forms. \"The time: two thousand  years\u2014more progress might have been expected, if any survivors at all  initially postulated; but this will do. The pessimists were mistaken. We  can begin again.\" Then, startlingly super-imposed on the cool  progression of logical thought, came a wave of raw emotion, devastating  in its force. It was a lustful image of a world once more obedient,  crawling, laboring to do the Ryzgas' will\u2014 toward the stars, the  stars! The icy calculation resumed: \"Immobilize these and the ones  indicated in the passage above. Then wake the rest....\"\n\n\n Var was staring in fascination at the Ryzga's face. It was a face formed  by the custom of unquestioned command; yet it was lined by a deeply  ingrained weariness, the signs of premature age\u2014denied, overridden by  the driving will they had sensed a moment earlier. It was a sick man's  face.\n\n\n The Ryzga's final thought clicked into place: Decision! He turned  toward the switchboard behind him, reaching with practised certainty for  one spot upon it.\n\n\n Neena screamed.\n\n\n Between the Ryzga and the control panel a nightmare shape reared up  seven feet tall, flapping black amorphous limbs and flashing red eyes  and white fangs. The Ryzga recoiled, and the weapon in his hand came up.  There was an instantaneous glare like heat lightning, and the monster  crumpled in on itself, twitched briefly and vanished.\n\n\n But in that moment a light of inspiration had flashed upon Var, and it  remained. As the Ryzga stretched out his hand again, Var acted. The  Ryzga froze, teetering off balance and almost falling, as a numbing grip  closed down on all his motor nerves.\n\n\n Holding that grip, Var strode across the floor and looked straight into  the Ryzga's frantic eyes. They glared back at him with such hatred and  such evil that for an instant he almost faltered. But the Ryzga's  efforts, as he strove to free himself from the neural hold, were as  misdirected and unavailing as those of a child who has not learned to  wrestle with the mind.\n\n\n Var had guessed right. When Neena in her terror had flung a dream  monster into the Ryzga's way\u2014a mere child's bogey out of a fairy  tale\u2014the Ryzga had not recognized it as such, but had taken it for a  real being. Var laughed aloud, and with great care, as one communicates  with an infant, he projected his thoughts into the other's mind. \"There  will be no new beginning for you in our world, Ryzga! In two thousand  years, we've learned some new things. Now at last I understand why you  built so many machines, such complicated arrangements of matter and  energy to do simple tasks\u2014it was because you knew no other way.\"\n\n\n Behind the hate-filled eyes the cold brain tried to reason still.  \"Barbarians...? Our party was wrong after all. After us the machine  civilization could never rise again, because it was a fire that consumed  its fuel. After us man could not survive on the Earth, because the  conditions that made him great were gone. The survivors must be  something else\u2014capacities undeveloped by our science\u2014after us the end  of man, the beginning.... But those of us who chose to die were right.\"\n\n\n The tide of hate and sick desire rose up to drown all coherence. The  Ryzga made a savage, wholly futile effort to lift the weapon in his  paralyzed hand. Then his eyes rolled upward, and abruptly he went limp  and fell in a heap, like a mechanical doll whose motive power has  failed.\n\n\n Var felt Neena beside him, and drew her close. As she sobbed her relief,  he continued to look down absently at the dead man. When at last he  raised his head, he saw that the drama's end had had a further audience.  In the outer doorway, backed by his clansmen, stood Groz, gazing first  in stupefaction at the fallen Ryzga, then with something like awe at  Var.\n\n\n Var eyed him for a long moment; then he smiled, and asked, \"Well, Groz?  Is our feud finished, or does your ambition for a worthy son-in-law go  beyond the conqueror of the Ryzgas?\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does The Watcher communicate with others?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"By talking as the rest of the people do\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Primarily with his mind\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Primarily with his mind\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Primarily with his mind\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Dark was the Ryzga mountain and forbidding; steep were its  cliffs and sheer its crevasses. But its outward perils could not compare  with the Ryzgas themselves, who slept within, ready to wake and  conquer.... At sunset they were in sight of the Ryzga mountain. Strangely it towered  among the cliffs and snow-slopes of the surrounding ranges: an immense  and repellently geometric cone, black, its sides blood-tinted by the  dying sun.\n\n\n Neena shivered, even though the surrounding cold could not reach her.  The ice-wind blew from the glacier, but Var's love was round her as a  warming cloak, a cloak that glowed softly golden in the deepening  twilight, even as her love was about him.\n\n\n Var said, \"The Watcher's cave should be three miles beyond this pass.\"  He stood rigid, trying to catch an echo of the Watcher's thoughts, but  there was nothing. Perhaps the old man was resting. From the other  direction, the long way that they two had come, it was not difficult to  sense the thought of Groz. That thought was powerful, and heavy with  vengeance.\n\n\n \"Hurry,\" said Neena. \"They're closer than they were an hour ago.\"\n\n\n She was beautiful and defiant, facing the red sunset and the black  mountain. Var sensed her fear, and the love that had conquered it. He  felt a wave of tenderness and bitterness. For him she had come to this.  For the flame that had sprung between them at the Truce of New Grass,  she had challenged the feud of their peoples and had left her home, to  follow him. Now, if her father and his kinsmen overtook them, it would  be death for Var, and for Neena living shame. Which of the two was worse  was no longer a simple problem to Var, who had grown much older in the  last days.\n\n\n \"Wait,\" he commanded. While she waited he spun a dream, attaching it to  the crags that loomed over the pass, and to the frozen ground underfoot.  It was black night, as it would really be when Groz and his henchmen  reached this place; lurid fire spewed from the Ryzga mountain, and  strange lights dipped above it; and for good measure there was an  avalanche in the dream, and hideous beasts rushed snapping and ravening  from the crevices of the rock.\n\n\n \"Oh!\" cried Neena in involuntary alarm.\n\n\n Var sighed, shaking his head. \"It won't hold them for long, but it's the  best I can do now. Come on.\"\n\n\n There was no path. Now they were descending the steeper face of the  sierra, and the way led over bottomless crevasses, sheer drops and sheer  ascents, sheets of traitorous glare ice. Place after place had to be  crossed on the air, and both grew weary with the effort such crossings  cost. They hoarded their strength, helping one another; one alone might  never have won through.\n\n\n It was starry night already when they saw the light from the Watcher's  cave. The light shone watery and dim from beneath the hoary back of the  glacier, and as they came nearer they saw why: the cave entrance was  sealed by a sheet of ice, a frozen waterfall that fell motionless from  the rocks above. They heard no sound.\n\n\n The two young people stared for a long minute, intrigued and fearful.  Both had heard of this place, and the ancient who lived there to keep  watch on the Ryzga mountain, as a part of the oldest legends of their  childhood; but neither had been here before.\n\n\n But this was no time for shyness. Var eyed the ice-curtain closely to  make sure that it was real, not dream-stuff; then he struck it boldly  with his fist. It shattered and fell in a rain of splinters, sparkling  in the light that poured from within. They felt the Watcher rouse, heard his footsteps, and finally saw him\u2014a  shrunken old man, white-haired, with a lined beardless face. The sight  of him, more marred by age than anyone they had ever seen before, was  disappointing. They had expected something more\u2014an ancient giant, a  tower of wisdom and strength. The Watcher was four hundred years old;  beside him even Groz, who had always seemed so ancient, was like a boy.\n\n\n The Watcher peered at them in turn. \"Welcome,\" he said in a cracked  voice. He did not speak again; the rest of his conversation was in  thought only. \"Welcome indeed. I am too much alone here.\"\n\n\n \"You were asleep!\" said Var. Shock made his thought accusing, though he  had not meant to be.\n\n\n The old man grinned toothlessly. \"Never fear. Asleep or awake, I watch.  Come in! You're letting in the wind.\"\n\n\n Inside the cave it was warm as summer. Var saw with some surprise that  all the walls were sheathed in ice\u2014warm to the touch, bound fast  against melting by the Watcher's will. Light blazed in reflections from  the ice walls, till there was no shadow in the place. Behind them began  a tinkling of falling water, thawed from the glacial ridges above to  descend sheet-wise over the cave mouth, freezing as it fell into  lengthening icicles. The old man gazed at his work for a moment, then  turned questioningly to the young pair.\n\n\n \"We need a little rest out of the cold,\" said Var. \"And food, if you can  spare it. We're pursued.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes. You shall have what I can give you. Make yourselves  comfortable, and in one minute.... Pursued, eh? A pity. I see the world  is as bad as it was when I was last in it.\"\n\n\n Hot food and drink were before them almost at once. The Watcher regarded  them with compassion as their eyes brightened and some of the shadow of  weariness lifted from them. \"You have stolen your enemy's daughter, no  doubt, young man? Such things happened when I was young.\"\n\n\n Warming to the old man now, Var sketched his and Neena's history  briefly. \"We should have been safe among my people by now. And before  very long, I'm sure, I would have performed some deed which Groz would  recognize as a worthy exploit, and would thus have healed the feud  between our families. But our flight was found out too soon. They cut us  off and forced us into the mountains, and now they are only a few hours  behind us.\"\n\n\n \"A pity, indeed. I would like to help you\u2014but, you understand, I am the  Mountain Watcher. I must be above feuds and families.\"\n\n\n Var nodded somberly, thinking that an old recluse would in any case be  able to do little for them against Groz and his violent kinsfolk.\n\n\n \"And what will you do now?\"\n\n\n Var grinned mirthlessly. \"We haven't much choice, since they're  overtaking us. I have only one idea left: we can go where Groz may fear  to follow us.\"\n\n\n \"To the mountain, you mean.\"\n\n\n \"And into it, if need be.\"\n\n\n The Watcher was broodingly silent; his eyes shifted to Neena, where she  nestled by Var's side. He asked, \"And you\u2014are you willing to follow  your lover in this?\"\n\n\n Neena returned his gaze without flinching; then she looked sidelong at  Var, and her lips curled with a proud and tender mockery. \"Follow? Why,  I will lead, if his courage should fail him.\" The old man said, \"It is no part of my duty to dissuade you from this  thing. You are free persons. But I must be sure that you know what you  are doing. That is the second part of the law the First Watcher made: to  guard lest the unwary and the ignorant should bring harm on themselves  and on all men.\"\n\n\n \"We know the stories,\" Var said brusquely. \"In the hollow heart of their  mountain the Ryzgas sleep, as they chose to do when their world  crumbled. But if they are wakened, the mountain will tremble, and the  Ryzgas will come forth.\"\n\n\n \"Do you believe that?\"\n\n\n \"As one believes stories.\"\n\n\n \"It is true,\" said the Watcher heavily. \"In my youth I penetrated  farther into the mountain than anyone before, farther even than did the  First Watcher. I did not see the sleepers, nor will any man until they  come again, but I met their sentries, the sentinel machines that guard  them now as they have for two thousand years. When I had gone that far,  the mountain began to shake, the force that is in the Earth rumbled  below, and I returned in time.\" Now for the first time Var sensed the  power in the old man's look, the power of four hundred years' wisdom.  Var stared down at his hands.\n\n\n \"The Ryzgas also were men,\" said the Watcher. \"But they were such a race  as the world has not seen before or since. There were tyrannies before  the Ryzgas, there was lust for power, and atrocious cruelty; but such  tyranny, power, and cruelty as theirs, had never been known. They ruled  the Earth for four generations, and the Earth was too little for them.  They laid the world waste, stripped it of metals and fuels and bored to  its heart for energy, poisoned its seas and its air with the fume of  their works, wrung its peoples dry for their labor ... and in each of  those four generations they launched a ship of space. They were great  and evil as no other people has been, because they wanted the stars.\n\n\n \"Because of them we must build with dreams instead of iron, and our only  fire is that of the Sun, and even now, two thousand years later, the  Earth is still slowly recovering from the pangs and poison of that age.  If you turn up the sod in the plain where the wild herds graze, you will  find numberless fragments of rusted or corroded metal, bits of glass and  strange plastic substances, debris of artifacts still showing the marks  of their shaping\u2014the scattered wreckage of the things they made. And  we\u2014we too are a remnant, the descendants of the few out of all humanity  that survived when the Ryzgas' world went down in flame and thunder.\n\n\n \"In the last generation of their power the Ryzgas knew by their science  that the race of man would endure them no longer. They made ready their  weapons, they mined the cities and the factories for destruction, making  sure that their works and their knowledge would perish with them.  Meanwhile they redoubled the yoke and the punishments, hastening the  completion of the last of the starships.\n\n\n \"From the memories that the old Watchers have left here, and from the  memories of dead men that still echo in the air, I have gathered a  picture of that world's end. I will show it to you....\" Var and Neena stared, unstirring, with wide vacant eyes, while the old  man wove a dream around them, and the bright ice-cave faded from their  vision, and they saw\u2014\n\n\n Black starless night, a sky of rolling smoke above the greatest city  that was ever built. Only the angry light of fires relieved the city's  darkness\u2014that, and the blue-white lightning flashes that silhouetted  the naked skeletons of buildings and were followed by thunder and a  shaking of the earth.\n\n\n Along lightless streets, half choked with rubble and with the dead,  poured a mad, hating horde. The recurrent flashes lit scarred faces,  naked bodies blackened and maimed from the hell of the workshops where  the Ryzgas' might had been forged, eyes that stared white and half  sightless from the glare of the furnaces, gnarled hands that now at long  last clutched the weapons of the last rebellion\u2014a rebellion without  hope of new life on a world gutted and smoldering from the fulfilment of  the Ryzgas' dream, without slogans other than a cry for blood.\n\n\n Before them death waited around the citadel where the masters still  fought. All round, from the lowest and most poisonous levels of the  shattered city, the slaves swarmed up in their millions. And the  lightning blazed, and the city howled and screamed and burned.\n\n\n Then, unbelievably, the thunder fell silent, and the silence swept  outward like a wave, from ruined street to street. The mouths that had  shouted their wrath were speechless, and the rage-blinded eyes were  lifted in sudden awe. From the center, over the citadel, an immense  white globe soared upward, rising swiftly without sound.\n\n\n They had never seen its like, but they knew. It was the last starship,  and it was leaving.\n\n\n It poised motionless. For an instant the burning city lay mute; then the  millions found voice. Some roared ferocious threats and curses; others  cried desolately\u2014 wait! Then the whole city, the dark tumuli of its buildings and its leaping  fires and tormented faces, and the black sky over it, seemed to twist  and swim, like a scene under water when a great fish sweeps past, and  the ship was gone.\n\n\n The stunned paralysis fell apart in fury. Flame towered over the  citadel. The hordes ran and shrieked again toward the central inferno,  and the city burned and burned.... Var blinked dazedly in the shadowless glow of the ice-cave. His arm  tightened about Neena till she gasped. He was momentarily uncertain that  he and she were real and here, such had been the force of the dream, a  vision of such scope and reality as Var had never seen\u2014no, lived  through\u2014before. With deep respect now he gazed upon the bent old man  who was the Mountain Watcher.\n\n\n \"Some of the Ryzgas took flight to the stars, and some perished on  Earth. But there was a group of them who believed that their time to  rule would come again. These raised a black mountain from the Earth's  heart, and in hollows within it cast themselves into deathless sleep,  their deathless and lifeless sentinels round them, to wait till someone  dare arouse them, or until their chosen time\u2014no one knows surely.\n\n\n \"I have told you the story you know, and have shown you a glimpse of the  old time, because I must make sure that you do not approach the mountain  in ignorance. Our world is unwise and sometimes evil, full of arrogance,  folly, and passion that are in the nature of man. Yet it is a happy  world, compared to that the Ryzgas made and will make again.\"\n\n\n The Watcher eyed them speculatively. \"Before all,\" he said finally,  \"this is a world where you are free to risk wakening the old tyrants, if  in your own judgment your great need renders the chance worth taking.\"\n\n\n Neena pressed her face against Var's shoulder, hiding her eyes. In her  mind as it groped for his there was a confusion of horror and pity. Var  looked grimly at the Watcher, and would have spoken; but the Watcher  seemed suddenly a very long way off, and Var could no longer feel his  own limbs, his face was a numb mask. Dully he heard the old man say,  \"You are tired. Best sleep until morning.\"\n\n\n Var strove to cry out that there was no time, that Groz was near and  that sleep was for infants and the aged, but his intention sank and  drowned under wave upon wave of unconquerable languor. The bright cave  swam and dissolved; his eyelids closed. Var woke. Daylight glimmered through the ice of the cave mouth. He had  been unconscious, helpless, for hours! At the thought of that, panic  gripped him. He had not slept since childhood, and he had forgotten how  it was.\n\n\n He came to his feet in one quick movement, realizing in that action that  sleep had refreshed his mind and body\u2014realizing also that a footstep  had wakened him. Across the cave he faced a young man who watched him  coolly with dark piercing eyes that were familiar though he did not know  the face.\n\n\n Neena sat up and stifled a cry of fright. Var growled, \"Who are you?  Where's the Watcher?\"\n\n\n The other flashed white teeth in a smile. \"I'm the Watcher,\" he  answered. \"Often I become a youth at morning, and relax into age as the  day passes. A foolish amusement, no doubt, but amusements are few here.\"\n\n\n \"You made us fall asleep. Groz will be on us\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Groz and his people could not detect your thoughts as you slept. They  were all night chasing elusive dreams on the high ridges, miles away.\"\n\n\n Var passed a hand across bewildered eyes. Neena said softly, \"Thank you,  Watcher.\"\n\n\n \"Don't thank me. I take no sides in your valley feuds. But now you are  rested, your minds are clear. Do you still mean to go on to the Ryzga  mountain?\"\n\n\n Not looking at the Watcher, Var muttered unsteadily, \"We have no  alternative.\"\n\n\n There was a liquid tinkling as the ice-curtain collapsed; the fresh  breeze of morning swept into the cave. The youth beckoned to them, and  they followed him outside.\n\n\n The glacial slope on which the cavern opened faced toward the mountain.  It rose black and forbidding in the dawn as it had by sunset. To right  and left of it, the grand cliffs, ocher and red, were lit splendidly by  the morning sun, but the mountain of the Ryzgas drank in the light and  gave nothing back.\n\n\n Below their feet the slope fell away into an opaque sea of fog, filling  a mile-wide gorge. There was a sound of turbulent water, of a river  dashed from rock to rock in its struggle toward the plain, but the  curling fog hid everything.\n\n\n \"You have an alternative,\" said the Watcher crisply. The two took their  eyes from the black mountain and gazed at him in sudden hope, but his  face was unsmiling. \"It is this. You, Var, can flee up the canyon to the  north, by a way I will show you, disguising your thoughts and masking  your presence as well as you are able, while the girl goes in the other  direction, southward, without seeking to conceal herself. Your pursuers  will be deceived and follow her, and by the time they catch her it will  be too late for them to overtake Var.\"\n\n\n That possibility had not occurred to them at all. Var and Neena looked  at one another. Then by common consent they blended their minds into  one.\n\n\n They thought, in the warm intimacy of unreserved understanding: \" It  would work: I-you would make the sacrifice of shame and mockery\u2014yet  these can be borne\u2014that I-you might be saved from death\u2014which is alone  irreparable.... But to become I and you again\u2014that cannot be  borne. \"\n\n\n They said in unison, \"No. Not that.\"\n\n\n The Watcher's face did not change. He said gravely, \"Very well. I will  give you what knowledge I have that may help you when you enter the  Ryzga mountain.\"\n\n\n Quickly, he impressed on them what he had learned of the structure of  the mountain and of its guardian machines. Var closed his eyes, a little  dizzied by the rapid flood of detail.\n\n\n \"You are ready to go,\" said the Watcher. He spoke aloud, and his voice  was cracked and harsh. Var opened his eyes in surprise, and saw that the  Watcher had become again the hoary ancient of last night.\n\n\n Var felt a twinge of unfamiliar emotion; only by its echo in Neena's  mind did he recognize it as a sense of guilt. He said stiffly, \"You  don't blame us?\"\n\n\n \"You have taken life in your own hands,\" rasped the Watcher. \"Who does  that needs no blessing and feels no curse. Go!\" They groped through the fog above blank abysses that hid the snarling  river, crept hand in hand, sharing their strength, across unstable dream  bridges from crag to crag. Groz and his pack, in their numbers, would  cross the gorge more surely and swiftly. When Var and Neena set foot at  last on the cindery slope of the great volcanic cone, they sensed that  the pursuit already halved their lead.\n\n\n They stood high on the side of the Ryzga mountain, and gazed at the  doorway. It was an opaque yet penetrable well of darkness, opening into  the face of a lava cliff, closed only by an intangible curtain\u2014so  little had the Ryzgas feared those who might assail them in their sleep.\n\n\n Var sent his thoughts probing beyond the curtain, listened intently,  head thrown back, to their echoes that returned. The tunnel beyond  slanted steeply downward. Var's hands moved, molding a radiant globe  from the feeble sunshine that straggled through the fog-bank. With an  abrupt motion he hurled it. The sun-globe vanished, as if the darkness  had drunk it up, but though sight did not serve they both sensed that it  had passed through to light up the depths beyond. For within the  mountain something snapped suddenly alert\u2014something alive yet not  living, seeing yet blind. They felt light-sensitive cells tingle in  response, felt electric currents sting along buried, long-idle  circuits....\n\n\n The two stood shivering together.\n\n\n The morning wind stirred, freshening, the fog lifted a little, and they  heard a great voice crying, \"There they are!\"\n\n\n Var and Neena turned. Far out in the sea of fog, on a dream bridge that  they could not see, stood Groz. He shook the staff he carried. It was  too far to discern the rage that must contort his features, but the  thought he hurled at them was a soundless bellow: \"Young fools! I've  caught you now!\"\n\n\n Behind Groz the figures of his followers loomed up as striding shadows.  Neena's hand tightened on Var's. Var sent a thought of defiance: \"Go  back! Or you'll drive us to enter the mountain!\"\n\n\n Groz seemed to hesitate. Then he swung his staff up like a weapon, and  for the two on the mountainside the world turned upside down, the  mountain's black shoulder hung inverted above them and the dizzy gulf of  sky was beneath. Var fought for footing with his balance gone, feeling  Neena reel against him until, summoning all his strength, he broke the  grip of the illusion and the world seemed to right itself. The mist  billowed again and Groz was out of sight, but they could hear him  exhorting his men to haste.\n\n\n Neena's face was deadly pale and her lips trembled, but her urgent  whisper said, \"Come on!\"\n\n\n Together they plunged into the curtain of darkness. At Var's thought command Neena froze instantly. \"Feel that!\" he  muttered, and she, listening, sensed it too: the infinitesimal trickle  of currents behind what appeared to be a blank tunnel wall, a rising  potential that seemed to whisper Ready ... ready.... The sun-globe floated behind them, casting light before them down the  featureless tunnel that sloped always toward the mountain's heart. Var  summoned it, and it drifted ahead, a dozen feet, a little more\u2014\n\n\n Between wall and wall a blinding spindle of flame sprang into being,  pulsed briefly with radiant energy that pained the eyes, and went out.  The immaterial globe of light danced on before them.\n\n\n \"Forward, before the charge builds up again!\" said Var. A few feet  further on, they stumbled over a pile of charred bones. Someone else had  made it only this far. It was farther than the Watcher had gone into  these uncharted regions, and only the utmost alertness of mind and sense  had saved them from death in traps like this. But as yet the way was not  blocked....\n\n\n Then they felt the mountain begin to tremble. A very faint and remote  vibration at first, then an increasingly potent shuddering of the floor  under their feet and the walls around them. Somewhere far below immense  energies were stirring for the first time in centuries. The power that  was in the Earth was rising; great wheels commenced to turn, the  mechanical servitors of the Ryzgas woke one by one and began to make  ready, while their masters yet slept, for the moment of rebirth that  might be near at hand.\n\n\n From behind, up the tunnel, came a clear involuntary thought of dismay,  then a directed thought, echoing and ghostly in the confinement of the  dark burrow:\n\n\n \" Stop! \u2014before you go too far!\"\n\n\n Var faced that way and thought coldly: \"Only if you return and let us go  free.\"\n\n\n In the black reaches of the shaft his will groped for and locked with  that of Groz, like the grip of two strong wrestlers. In that grip each  knew with finality that the other's stubbornness matched his own\u2014that  neither would yield, though the mountain above them and the world  outside should crumble to ruin around them.\n\n\n \"Follow us, then!\"\n\n\n They plunged deeper into the mountain. And the shaking of the mountain  increased with every step, its vibrations became sound, and its sound  was like that of the terrible city which they had seen in the dream.  Through the slow-rolling thunder of the hidden machines seemed to echo  the death-cries of a billion slaves, the despair of all flesh and blood  before their monstrous and inhuman power.\n\n\n Without warning, lights went on. Blinking in their glare, Var and Neena  saw that fifty paces before them the way opened out into a great rounded  room that was likewise ablaze with light. Cautiously they crept forward  to the threshold of that chamber at the mountain's heart.\n\n\n Its roof was vaulted; its circular walls were lined with panels studded  with gleaming control buttons, levers, colored lights. As they watched  light flicked on and off in changing patterns, registering the  progressive changes in the vast complex of mechanisms for which this  must be the central control station. Behind those boards circuits opened  and closed in bewildering confusion; the two invaders felt the rapid  shifting of magnetic fields, the fury of electrons boiling in vacuum....\n\n\n For long moments they forgot the pursuit, forgot everything in wonder at  this place whose remotest like they had never seen in the simplicity of  their machineless culture. In all the brilliant space there was no life.  They looked at one another, the same thought coming to both at once:  perhaps, after two thousand years, the masters were dead after all, and  only the machines remained? As if irresistibly drawn, they stepped over  the threshold.\n\n\n There was a clang of metal like a signal. Halfway up the wall opposite,  above a narrow ramp that descended between the instrument panels, a  massive doorway swung wide, and in its opening a figure stood.\n\n\n Var and Neena huddled frozenly, half expecting each instant to be their  last. And the Ryzga too stood motionless, looking down at them. He was a man of middle height and stocky build, clad in a garment of  changing colors, of fabric delicate as dream-stuff. In his right hand,  with the care one uses with a weapon, he grasped a gleaming metal tube;  his other hand rested as for support against the frame of the doorway.  That, and his movements when he came slowly down the ramp toward them,  conveyed a queer suggestion of weariness or weakness, as if he were yet  not wholly roused from his two millenia of slumber. But the Ryzga's  manner and his mind radiated a consciousness of power, a pride and  assurance of self that smote them like a numbing blow.\n\n\n With a new shock, Var realized that the Ryzga's thoughts were quite  open. They had a terse, disconnected quality that was strange and  unsettling, and in part they were couched in alien and unintelligible  symbols. But there was no block. Apparently the Ryzga felt no need to  close his mind in the presence of inferior creatures....\n\n\n He paused with his back to the central control panel, and studied the  interlopers with the dispassionate gaze of a scientist examining a new,  but not novel, species of insect. His thoughts seemed to click, like  metal parts of a mechanism falling into places prepared for them. The  image occurred oddly to Var, to whom such a comparison would ordinarily  have been totally strange.\n\n\n \"Culture: late barbarism. Handwork of high quality\u2014good. Physically  excellent stock....\" There was a complicated and incomprehensible  schemata of numbers and abstract forms. \"The time: two thousand  years\u2014more progress might have been expected, if any survivors at all  initially postulated; but this will do. The pessimists were mistaken. We  can begin again.\" Then, startlingly super-imposed on the cool  progression of logical thought, came a wave of raw emotion, devastating  in its force. It was a lustful image of a world once more obedient,  crawling, laboring to do the Ryzgas' will\u2014 toward the stars, the  stars! The icy calculation resumed: \"Immobilize these and the ones  indicated in the passage above. Then wake the rest....\"\n\n\n Var was staring in fascination at the Ryzga's face. It was a face formed  by the custom of unquestioned command; yet it was lined by a deeply  ingrained weariness, the signs of premature age\u2014denied, overridden by  the driving will they had sensed a moment earlier. It was a sick man's  face.\n\n\n The Ryzga's final thought clicked into place: Decision! He turned  toward the switchboard behind him, reaching with practised certainty for  one spot upon it.\n\n\n Neena screamed.\n\n\n Between the Ryzga and the control panel a nightmare shape reared up  seven feet tall, flapping black amorphous limbs and flashing red eyes  and white fangs. The Ryzga recoiled, and the weapon in his hand came up.  There was an instantaneous glare like heat lightning, and the monster  crumpled in on itself, twitched briefly and vanished.\n\n\n But in that moment a light of inspiration had flashed upon Var, and it  remained. As the Ryzga stretched out his hand again, Var acted. The  Ryzga froze, teetering off balance and almost falling, as a numbing grip  closed down on all his motor nerves.\n\n\n Holding that grip, Var strode across the floor and looked straight into  the Ryzga's frantic eyes. They glared back at him with such hatred and  such evil that for an instant he almost faltered. But the Ryzga's  efforts, as he strove to free himself from the neural hold, were as  misdirected and unavailing as those of a child who has not learned to  wrestle with the mind.\n\n\n Var had guessed right. When Neena in her terror had flung a dream  monster into the Ryzga's way\u2014a mere child's bogey out of a fairy  tale\u2014the Ryzga had not recognized it as such, but had taken it for a  real being. Var laughed aloud, and with great care, as one communicates  with an infant, he projected his thoughts into the other's mind. \"There  will be no new beginning for you in our world, Ryzga! In two thousand  years, we've learned some new things. Now at last I understand why you  built so many machines, such complicated arrangements of matter and  energy to do simple tasks\u2014it was because you knew no other way.\"\n\n\n Behind the hate-filled eyes the cold brain tried to reason still.  \"Barbarians...? Our party was wrong after all. After us the machine  civilization could never rise again, because it was a fire that consumed  its fuel. After us man could not survive on the Earth, because the  conditions that made him great were gone. The survivors must be  something else\u2014capacities undeveloped by our science\u2014after us the end  of man, the beginning.... But those of us who chose to die were right.\"\n\n\n The tide of hate and sick desire rose up to drown all coherence. The  Ryzga made a savage, wholly futile effort to lift the weapon in his  paralyzed hand. Then his eyes rolled upward, and abruptly he went limp  and fell in a heap, like a mechanical doll whose motive power has  failed.\n\n\n Var felt Neena beside him, and drew her close. As she sobbed her relief,  he continued to look down absently at the dead man. When at last he  raised his head, he saw that the drama's end had had a further audience.  In the outer doorway, backed by his clansmen, stood Groz, gazing first  in stupefaction at the fallen Ryzga, then with something like awe at  Var.\n\n\n Var eyed him for a long moment; then he smiled, and asked, \"Well, Groz?  Is our feud finished, or does your ambition for a worthy son-in-law go  beyond the conqueror of the Ryzgas?\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does The Watcher communicate with others?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"By talking as the rest of the people do\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Primarily with his mind\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Primarily with his mind\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Primarily with his mind\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
