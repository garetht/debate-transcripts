      "background_text": "PEGGY FINDS THE THEATER I Dramatic Dialogue \u201cOf course, this is no surprise to us,\u201d Thomas Lane  said to his daughter Peggy, who perched tensely on  the edge of a kitchen stool. \u201cWe could hardly have  helped knowing that you\u2019ve wanted to be an actress  since you were out of your cradle. It\u2019s just that decisions  like this can\u2019t be made quickly.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut, Dad!\u201d Peggy almost wailed. \u201cYou just finished  saying yourself that I\u2019ve been thinking about  this and wanting it for years! You can\u2019t follow that by  calling it a quick decision!\u201d She turned to her mother,  her hazel eyes flashing under a mass of dark chestnut  curls. \u201cMother, you understand, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\n Mrs. Lane smiled gently and placed her soft white  hand on her daughter\u2019s lean brown one. \u201cOf course  I understand, Margaret, and so does your father. We  both want to do what\u2019s best for you, not to stand in  your way. The only question is whether the time is  right, or if you should wait longer.\u201d\n\n2\n\n \u201cWait! Mother\u2014Dad\u2014I\u2019m years behind already!  The theater is full of beginners a year and even two  years younger than I am, and girls of my age have  lots of acting credits already. Besides, what is there to  wait for?\u201d\n\n\n Peggy\u2019s father put down his coffee cup and leaned  back in the kitchen chair until it tilted on two legs  against the wall behind him. He took his time before  answering. When he finally spoke, his voice was  warm and slow.\n\n\n \u201cPeg, I don\u2019t want to hold up your career. I don\u2019t  have any objections to your wanting to act. I think\u2014judging  from the plays I\u2019ve seen you in at high  school and college\u2014that you have a real talent. But  I thought that if you would go on with college for  three more years and get your degree, you would  gain so much worth-while knowledge that you\u2019d use  and enjoy for the rest of your life\u2014\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut not acting knowledge!\u201d Peggy cried.\n\n\n \u201cThere\u2019s more to life than that,\u201d her father put in.  \u201cThere\u2019s history and literature and foreign languages  and mathematics and sciences and music and art  and philosophy and a lot more\u2014all of them fascinating  and all important.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNone of them is as fascinating as acting to me,\u201d  Peggy replied, \u201cand none of them is nearly as important  to my life.\u201d\n\n3\n\n Mrs. Lane nodded. \u201cOf course, dear. I know just  how you feel about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI would have answered  just the same way when I was your age, except  that for me it was singing instead of acting. But\u2014\u201d and  here her pleasant face betrayed a trace of  sadness\u2014\u201cbut I was never able to be a singer. I guess  I wasn\u2019t quite good enough or else I didn\u2019t really  want it hard enough\u2014to go on with all the study and  practice it needed.\u201d\n\n\n She paused and looked thoughtfully at her daughter\u2019s  intense expression, then took a deep breath before  going on.\n\n\n \u201cWhat you must realize, Margaret, is that you may  not quite make the grade. We think you\u2019re wonderful,  but the theater is full of young girls whose parents  thought they were the most talented things  alive; girls who won all kinds of applause in high-school  and college plays; girls who have everything  except luck. You may be one of these girls, and if you  are, we want you to be prepared for it. We want you  to have something to fall back on, just in case  you ever need it.\u201d\n\n\n Mr. Lane, seeing Peggy\u2019s hurt look, was quick to  step in with reassurance. \u201cWe don\u2019t think you\u2019re going  to fail, Peg. We have every confidence in you and  your talents. I don\u2019t see how you could miss being the  biggest success ever\u2014but I\u2019m your father, not a  Broadway critic or a play producer, and I could be  wrong. And if I am wrong, I don\u2019t want you to be  hurt. All I ask is that you finish college and get a  teacher\u2019s certificate so that you can always find  useful work if you have to. Then you can try your  luck in the theater. Doesn\u2019t that make sense?\u201d\n\n4\n\n Peggy stared at the faded linoleum on the floor for  a few moments before answering. Then, looking first  at her mother and then at her father, she replied  firmly, \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t! It might make sense if we  were talking about anything else but acting, but  we\u2019re not. If I\u2019m ever going to try, I\u2019ll have a better  chance now than I will in three years. But I can see  your point of view, Dad, and I\u2019ll tell you what\u2014I\u2019ll  make a bargain with you.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat sort of bargain, Peg?\u201d her father asked curiously.\n\n\n \u201cIf you let me go to New York now, and if I can get  into a good drama school there, I\u2019ll study and try to  find acting jobs at the same time. That way I\u2019ll still be  going to school and I\u2019ll be giving myself a chance.  And if I\u2019m not started in a career in one year, I\u2019ll go  back to college and get my teacher\u2019s certificate before  I try the theater again. How does that sound to  you?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt sounds fair enough,\u201d Tom Lane admitted, \u201cbut  are you so confident that you\u2019ll see results in one  year? After all, some of our top stars worked many  times that long before getting any recognition.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t expect recognition in one year, Dad,\u201d  Peggy said. \u201cI\u2019m not that conceited or that silly. All  I hope is that I\u2019ll be able to get a part in that time,  and maybe be able to make a living out of acting.  And that\u2019s probably asking too much. If I have to,  I\u2019ll make a living at something else, maybe working  in an office or something, while I wait for parts. What  I want to prove in this year is that I can act. If I can\u2019t,  I\u2019ll come home.\u201d\n\n5\n\n \u201cIt seems to me, Tom, that Margaret has a pretty  good idea of what she\u2019s doing,\u201d Mrs. Lane said. \u201cShe  sounds sensible and practical. If she were all starry-eyed  and expected to see her name in lights in a few  weeks, I\u2019d vote against her going, but I\u2019m beginning  to think that maybe she\u2019s right about this being the  best time.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, Mother!\u201d Peggy shouted, jumping down from  the stool and throwing her arms about her mother\u2019s  neck. \u201cI knew you\u2019d understand! And you understand  too, don\u2019t you, Dad?\u201d she appealed.\n\n\n Her father replied in little puffs as he drew on his  pipe to get it started. \u201cI ... never said ... I didn\u2019t  ... understand you ... did I?\u201d His pipe satisfactorily  sending up thick clouds of fragrant smoke, he  took it out of his mouth before continuing more  evenly.\n\n\n \u201cPeg, your mother and I are cautious only because  we love you so much and want what\u2019s going to make  you happy. At the same time, we want to spare you  any unnecessary unhappiness along the way. Remember,  I\u2019m not a complete stranger to show business.  Before I came out here to Rockport to edit the Eagle ,  I worked as a reporter on one of the best papers in  New York. I saw a lot ... I met a lot of actors and  actresses ... and I know how hard the city often  was for them. But I don\u2019t want to protect you from  life. That\u2019s no good either. Just let me think about it  a little longer and let me talk to your mother some  more.\u201d\n\n6\n\n Mrs. Lane patted Peggy\u2019s arm and said, \u201cWe won\u2019t  keep you in suspense long, dear. Why don\u2019t you go  out for a walk for a while and let us go over the situation  quietly? We\u2019ll decide before bedtime.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy nodded silently and walked to the kitchen  door, where she paused to say, \u201cI\u2019m just going out to  the barn to see if Socks is all right for the night. Then  maybe I\u2019ll go down to Jean\u2019s for a while.\u201d\n\n\n As she stepped out into the soft summer dusk she  turned to look back just in time to see her mother  throw her a comically exaggerated wink of assurance.  Feeling much better, Peggy shut the screen door behind  her and started for the barn.\n\n\n Ever since she had been a little girl, the barn had  been Peggy\u2019s favorite place to go to be by herself and  think. Its musty but clean scent of straw and horses  and leather made her feel calm and alive. Breathing  in its odor gratefully, she walked into the half-dark to  Socks\u2019s stall. As the little bay horse heard her coming,  she stamped one foot and softly whinnied a greeting.  Peggy stopped first at the bag that hung on the wall  among the bridles and halters and took out a lump of  sugar as a present. Then, after stroking Socks\u2019s silky  nose, she held out her palm with the sugar cube.  Socks took it eagerly and pushed her nose against  Peggy\u2019s hand in appreciation.\n\n\n As Peggy mixed some oats and barley for her pet  and checked to see that there was enough straw in  the stall, she thought about her life in Rockport and  the new life that she might soon be going to.\n\n7\n\n Rockport, Wisconsin, was a fine place, as pretty a  small town as any girl could ask to grow up in. And  not too small, either, Peggy thought. Its 16,500 people  supported good schools, an excellent library, and two  good movie houses. What\u2019s more, the Rockport Community  College attracted theater groups and concert  artists, so that life in the town had always been stimulating.  And of course, all of this was in addition to the  usual growing-up pleasures of swimming and sailing,  movie dates, and formal dances\u2014everything that a  girl could want.\n\n\n Peggy had lived all her life here, knew every tree-shaded  street, every country road, field, lake, and  stream. All of her friends were here, friends she had  known since her earliest baby days. It would be hard  to leave them, she knew, but there was no doubt in  her mind that she was going to do so. If not now, then  as soon as she possibly could.\n\n\n It was not any dissatisfaction with her life, her  friends, or her home that made Peggy want to leave  Rockport. She was not running away from anything,  she reminded herself; she was running to something.\n\n\n To what? To the bright lights, speeding taxis, glittering  towers of a make-believe movie-set New York?  Would it really be like that? Or would it be something  different, something like the dreary side-street  world of failure and defeat that she had also seen in  movies?\n\n8\n\n Seeing the image of herself hungry and tired, going  from office to office looking for a part in a play,  Peggy suddenly laughed aloud and brought herself  back to reality, to the warm barn smell and the big,  soft-eyed gaze of Socks. She threw her arm around  the smooth bay neck and laid her face next to the  horse\u2019s cheek.\n\n\n \u201cSocks,\u201d she murmured, \u201cI need some of your horse  sense if I\u2019m going to go out on my own! We\u2019ll go  for a fast run in the morning and see if some fresh air  won\u2019t clear my silly mind!\u201d\n\n\n With a final pat, she left the stall and the barn behind,  stepping out into the deepening dusk. It was  still too early to go back to the house to see if her parents  had reached a decision about her future. Fighting  down an impulse to rush right into the kitchen to  see how they were coming along, Peggy continued  down the driveway and turned left on the slate sidewalk  past the front porch of her family\u2019s old farmhouse  and down the street toward Jean Wilson\u2019s  house at the end of the block.\n\n\n As she walked by her own home, she noticed with  a familiar tug at her heart how the lilac bushes on  the front lawn broke up the light from the windows  behind them into a pattern of leafy lace. For a moment,  or maybe a little more, she wondered why she  wanted to leave this. What for? What could ever be  better?\n\n9 II Dramatic Decision Upstairs at the Wilsons\u2019, Peggy found Jean swathed  in bath towels, washing her long, straight red hair,  which was now white with lather and piled up in a  high, soapy knot.\n\n\n \u201cYou just washed it yesterday!\u201d Peggy said. \u201cAre  you doing it again\u2014or still?\u201d\n\n\n Jean grinned, her eyes shut tight against the soapsuds.  \u201cAgain, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d she answered. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s  a nervous habit!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder you\u2019re not bald, with all the rubbing  you give your hair,\u201d Peggy said with a laugh.\n\n\n \u201cWell, if I do go bald, at least it will be with a  clean scalp!\u201d Jean answered with a humorous crinkle  of her freckled nose. Taking a deep breath and puffing  out her cheeks comically, she plunged her head  into the basin and rinsed off the soap with a shampoo  hose. When she came up at last, dripping-wet  hair was tightly plastered to the back of her head.\n\n\n \u201cThere!\u201d she announced. \u201cDon\u2019t I look beautiful?\u201d\n\n10\n\n After a brisk rubdown with one towel, Jean rolled  another dry towel around her head like an Indian  turban. Then, having wrapped herself in an ancient,  tattered, plaid bathrobe, she led Peggy out of the  steamy room and into her cozy, if somewhat cluttered,  bedroom. When they had made themselves  comfortable on the pillow-strewn daybeds, Jean came  straight to the point.\n\n\n \u201cSo the grand debate is still going on, is it? When  do you think they\u2019ll make up their minds?\u201d she asked.\n\n\n \u201cHow do you know they haven\u2019t decided anything  yet?\u201d Peggy said, in a puzzled tone.\n\n\n \u201cOh, that didn\u2019t take much deduction, my dear  Watson,\u201d Jean laughed. \u201cIf they had decided against  the New York trip, your face would be as long as  Socks\u2019s nose, and it\u2019s not half that long. And if the answer  was yes, I wouldn\u2019t have to wait to hear about it!  You would have been flying around the room and  talking a mile a minute. So I figured that nothing was  decided yet.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou know, if I were as smart as you,\u201d Peggy said  thoughtfully, \u201cI would have figured out a way to convince  Mother and Dad by now.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, don\u2019t feel bad about being dumb,\u201d Jean said in  mock tones of comfort. \u201cIf I were as pretty and talented  as you are, I wouldn\u2019t need brains, either!\u201d  With a hoot of laughter, she rolled quickly aside on  the couch to avoid the pillow that Peggy threw at  her.\n\n\n A short, breathless pillow fight followed, leaving  the girls limp with laughter and with Jean having to  retie her towel turban. From her new position, flat on  the floor, Peggy looked up at her friend with a rueful  smile.\n\n11\n\n \u201cYou know, I sometimes think that we haven\u2019t  grown up at all!\u201d she said. \u201cI can hardly blame my  parents for thinking twice\u2014and a lot more\u2014before  treating me like an adult.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNonsense!\u201d Jean replied firmly. \u201cYour parents  know a lot better than to confuse being stuffy with  being grown-up and responsible. And, besides, I  know that they\u2019re not the least bit worried about your  being able to take care of yourself. I heard them talking  with my folks last night, and they haven\u2019t got a  doubt in the world about you. But they know how  hard it can be to get a start as an actress, and they  want to be sure that you have a profession in case  you don\u2019t get a break in show business.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI know,\u201d Peggy answered. \u201cWe had a long talk  about it this evening after dinner.\u201d Then she told her  friend about the conversation and her proposed \u201cbargain\u201d  with her parents.\n\n\n \u201cThey both seemed to think it was fair,\u201d she concluded,  \u201cand when I went out, they were talking it  over. They promised me an answer by bedtime, and  I\u2019m over here waiting until the jury comes in with its  decision. You know,\u201d she said suddenly, sitting up  on the floor and crossing her legs under her, \u201cI bet  they wouldn\u2019t hesitate a minute if you would only  change your mind and decide to come with me and  try it too!\u201d\n\n12\n\n After a moment\u2019s thoughtful silence, Jean answered  slowly, \u201cNo, Peg. I\u2019ve thought this all out before,  and I know it would be as wrong for me as it is  right for you. I know we had a lot of fun in the dramatic  groups, and I guess I was pretty good as a  comedienne in a couple of the plays, but I know I  haven\u2019t got the real professional thing\u2014and I know  that you have. In fact, the only professional talent I  think I do have for the theater is the ability to recognize  talent when I see it\u2014and to recognize that it\u2019s  not there when it isn\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut, Jean,\u201d Peggy protested, \u201cyou can handle  comedy and character lines as well as anyone I  know!\u201d\n\n\n Jean nodded, accepting the compliment and seeming  at the same time to brush it off. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t  matter. You know even better than I that there\u2019s a lot  more to being an actress\u2014a successful one\u2014than  reading lines well. There\u2019s the ability to make the  audience sit up and notice you the minute you walk  on, whether you have lines or not. And that\u2019s something  you can\u2019t learn; you either have it, or you  don\u2019t. It\u2019s like being double-jointed. I can make an  audience laugh when I have good lines, but you can  make them look at you and respond to you and be  with you all the way, even with bad lines. That\u2019s  why you\u2019re going to go to New York and be an actress.  And that\u2019s why I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut, Jean\u2014\u201d Peggy began.\n\n13\n\n \u201cNo buts!\u201d Jean cut in. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this  enough before, and I\u2019m not going to change my  mind. I\u2019m as sure about what I want as you are about  what you want. I\u2019m going to finish college and get my  certificate as an English teacher.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cAnd what about acting? Can you get it out of  your mind as easily as all that?\u201d Peggy asked.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s the dark and devious part of my plan,\u201d  Jean answered with a mysterious laugh that ended in  a comic witch\u2019s cackle and an unconvincing witch-look  that was completely out of place on her round,  freckled face. \u201cOnce I get into a high school as an  English teacher, I\u2019m going to try to teach a special  course in the literature of the theater and maybe another  one in stagecraft. I\u2019m going to work with the  high-school drama group and put on plays. That way,  I\u2019ll be in a spot where I can use my special talent of  recognizing talent. And that way,\u201d she added, becoming  much more serious, \u201cI have a chance really to  do something for the theater. If I can help and encourage  one or two people with real talent like yours,  then I\u2019ll feel that I\u2019ve really done something worth  while.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy nodded silently, not trusting herself to  speak for fear of saying something foolishly sentimental,  or even of crying. Her friend\u2019s earnestness about  the importance of her work and her faith in Peggy\u2019s  talent had touched her more than she could say.\n\n14\n\n The silence lasted what seemed a terribly long  time, until Jean broke it by suddenly jumping up and  flinging a last pillow which she had been hiding behind  her back. Running out of the bedroom, she  called, \u201cCome on! I\u2019ll race you down to the kitchen  for cocoa! By the time we\u2019re finished, it\u2019ll be about  time for your big Hour of Decision scene!\u201d It was nearly ten o\u2019clock when Peggy finally felt  that her parents had had enough time to talk things  out. Leaving the Wilson house, she walked slowly  despite her eagerness, trying in all fairness to give her  mother and father every minute she could. Reaching  her home, she cut across the lawn behind the lilac  bushes, to the steps up to the broad porch that  fronted the house. As she climbed the steps, she  heard her father\u2019s voice raised a little above its normal  soft, deep tone, but she could not make out the  words.\n\n\n Crossing the porch, she caught sight of him  through the window. He was speaking on the telephone,  and now she caught his words.\n\n\n \u201cFine. Yes.... Yes\u2014I think we can. Very  well, day after tomorrow, then. That\u2019s right\u2014all  three of us. And, May\u2014it\u2019ll be good to see you again,  after all these years! Good-by.\u201d\n\n\n As Peggy entered the room, her father put down  the phone and turned to Mrs. Lane. \u201cWell, Betty,\u201d  he said, \u201cit\u2019s all set.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s all set, Dad?\u201d Peggy said, breaking into a  run to her father\u2019s side.\n\n15\n\n \u201cEverything\u2019s all set, Peg,\u201d her father said with a  grin. \u201cAnd it\u2019s set just the way you wanted it! There\u2019s  not a man in the world who can hold out against  two determined women.\u201d He leaned back against the  fireplace mantel, waiting for the explosion he felt  sure was to follow his announcement. But Peggy just  stood, hardly moving a muscle. Then she walked  carefully, as if she were on the deck of a rolling ship,  to the big easy chair and slowly sat down.\n\n\n \u201cWell, for goodness\u2019 sake!\u201d her mother cried.  \u201cWhere\u2019s the enthusiasm?\u201d\n\n\n Peggy swallowed hard before answering. When  her voice came, it sounded strange, about two tones  higher than usual. \u201cI ... I\u2019m trying to be sedate ... and  poised ... and very grown-up,\u201d she said.  \u201cBut it\u2019s not easy. All I want to do is to\u2014\u201d and she  jumped out of the chair\u2014\u201cto yell whoopee !\u201d She  yelled at the top of her lungs.\n\n\n After the kisses, the hugs, and the first excitement,  Peggy and her parents adjourned to the kitchen, the  favorite household conference room, for cookies and  milk and more talk.\n\n\n \u201cNow, tell me, Dad,\u201d Peggy asked, her mouth full  of oatmeal cookies, no longer \u201csedate\u201d or \u201cpoised,\u201d  but her natural, bubbling self. \u201cWho was that on the  phone, and where are the three of us going, and  what\u2019s all set?\u201d\n\n16\n\n \u201cOne thing at a time,\u201d her father said. \u201cTo begin  with, we decided almost as soon as you left that we  were going to let you go to New York to try a year\u2019s  experience in the theater. But then we had to decide  just where you would live, and where you should  study, and how much money you would need, and a  whole lot of other things. So I called New York to talk  to an old friend of mine who I felt would be able to  give us some help. Her name is May Berriman, and  she\u2019s spent all her life in the theater. In fact, she was  a very successful actress. Now she\u2019s been retired for  some years, but I thought she might give us some  good advice.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cAnd did she?\u201d Peggy asked.\n\n\n \u201cWe were luckier than I would have thought possible,\u201d  Mrs. Lane put in. \u201cIt seems that May bought a  big, old-fashioned town house and converted it into  a rooming house especially for young actresses. She  always wanted a house of her own with a garden in  back, but felt it was foolish for a woman living alone.  This way, she can afford to run a big place and at  the same time not be alone. And best of all, she says  she has a room that you can have!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, Mother! It sounds wonderful!\u201d Peggy exulted.  \u201cI\u2019ll be with other girls my own age who are actresses,  and living with an experienced actress! I\u2019ll bet she  can teach me loads!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m sure she can,\u201d her father said. \u201cAnd so can  the New York Dramatic Academy.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cDad!\u201d Peggy shouted, almost choking on a cooky.  \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve managed to get me accepted  there! That\u2019s the best dramatic school in the country!  How\u2014?\u201d\n\n17\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t get too excited, Peg,\u201d Mr. Lane interrupted.  \u201cYou\u2019re not accepted anywhere yet, but May  Berriman told me that the Academy is the best place  to study acting, and she said she would set up an  audition for you in two days. The term starts in a  couple of weeks, so there isn\u2019t much time to lose.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTwo days! Do you mean we\u2019ll be going to New  York day after tomorrow, just like that?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, no,\u201d her mother answered calmly. \u201cWe\u2019re going  to New York tomorrow on the first plane that we  can get seats on. Your father doesn\u2019t believe in wasting  time, once his mind is made up.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTomorrow?\u201d Peggy repeated, almost unable to believe  what she had heard. \u201cWhat are we sitting here  talking for, then? I\u2019ve got a million things to do! I\u2019ve  got to get packed ... I\u2019ve got to think of what to  read for the audition! I can study on the plane, I  guess, but ... oh! I\u2019ll be terrible in a reading unless  I can have more time! Oh, Mother, what parts  will I do? Where\u2019s the Shakespeare? Where\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhoa!\u201d Mr. Lane said, catching Peggy\u2019s arm to  prevent her from rushing out of the kitchen. \u201cNot  now, young lady! We\u2019ll pack in the morning, talk  about what you should read, and take an afternoon  plane to New York. But tonight, you\u2019d better think  of nothing more than getting to bed. This is going to  be a busy time for all of us.\u201d\n\n\n Reluctantly, Peggy agreed, recognizing the sense  of what her father said. She finished her milk and  cookies, kissed her parents good night and went upstairs  to bed.\n\n\n But it was one thing to go to bed and another to  go to sleep.\n\n18\n\n Peggy lay on her back, staring at the ceiling and  the patterns of light and shade cast by the street  lamp outside as it shone through the leaves of the big  maple tree. As she watched the shifting shadows,  she reviewed the roles she had played since her first  time in a high-school play. Which should she refresh  herself on? Which ones would she do best? And  which ones were most suited to her now? She recognized  that she had grown and developed past some  of the roles which had once seemed perfectly suited  to her talent and her appearance. But both had  changed. She was certainly not a mature actress  yet, from any point of view, but neither was she a  schoolgirl. Her trim figure was well formed; her face  had lost the undefined, simple cuteness of the early  teens, and had gained character. She didn\u2019t think she  should read a young romantic part like Juliet. Not  that she couldn\u2019t do it, but perhaps something  sharper was called for.\n\n\n Perhaps Viola in Twelfth Night ? Or perhaps not  Shakespeare at all. Maybe the people at the Academy  would think she was too arty or too pretentious?  Maybe she should do something dramatic and full of  stormy emotion, like Blanche in A Streetcar Named  Desire ? Or, better for her development and age, a  light, brittle, comedy role...?\n\n19\n\n Nothing seemed quite right. Peggy\u2019s thoughts  shifted with the shadows overhead. All the plays she  had ever seen or read or acted in melted together in  a blur, until the characters from one seemed to be  talking with the characters from another and moving  about in an enormous set made of pieces from two or  three different plays. More actors kept coming on in  a fantastic assortment of costumes until the stage was  full. Then the stage lights dimmed, the actors joined  hands across the stage to bow, the curtain slowly  descended, the lights went out\u2014and Peggy was fast  asleep. ",

It\u2019s just that decisions  like this can\u2019t be made quickly.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut, Dad!\u201d Peggy almost wailed. \u201cYou just finished  saying yourself that I\u2019ve been thinking about  this and wanting it for years! You can\u2019t follow that by  calling it a quick decision!\u201d She turned to her mother,  her hazel eyes flashing under a mass of dark chestnut  curls. \u201cMother, you understand, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\n Mrs. Lane smiled gently and placed her soft white  hand on her daughter\u2019s lean brown one. \u201cOf course  I understand, Margaret, and so does your father. We  both want to do what\u2019s best for you, not to stand in  your way. The only question is whether the time is  right, or if you should wait longer.\u201d\n\n2\n\n \u201cWait! Mother\u2014Dad\u2014I\u2019m years behind already!  The theater is full of beginners a year and even two  years younger than I am, and girls of my age have  lots of acting credits already. Besides, what is there to  wait for?\u201d\n\n\n Peggy\u2019s father put down his coffee cup and leaned  back in the kitchen chair until it tilted on two legs  against the wall behind him. He took his time before  answering. When he finally spoke, his voice was  warm and slow.\n\n\n \u201cPeg, I don\u2019t want to hold up your career. I don\u2019t  have any objections to your wanting to act. I think\u2014judging  from the plays I\u2019ve seen you in at high  school and college\u2014that you have a real talent. But  I thought that if you would go on with college for  three more years and get your degree, you would  gain so much worth-while knowledge that you\u2019d use  and enjoy for the rest of your life\u2014\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut not acting knowledge!\u201d Peggy cried.\n\n\n \u201cThere\u2019s more to life than that,\u201d her father put in.  \u201cThere\u2019s history and literature and foreign languages  and mathematics and sciences and music and art  and philosophy and a lot more\u2014all of them fascinating  and all important.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNone of them is as fascinating as acting to me,\u201d  Peggy replied, \u201cand none of them is nearly as important  to my life.\u201d\n\n3\n\n Mrs. Lane nodded. \u201cOf course, dear. I know just  how you feel about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI would have answered  just the same way when I was your age, except  that for me it was singing instead of acting. But\u2014\u201d and  here her pleasant face betrayed a trace of  sadness\u2014\u201cbut I was never able to be a singer. I guess  I wasn\u2019t quite good enough or else I didn\u2019t really  want it hard enough\u2014to go on with all the study and  practice it needed.\u201d\n\n\n She paused and looked thoughtfully at her daughter\u2019s  intense expression, then took a deep breath before  going on.\n\n\n \u201cWhat you must realize, Margaret, is that you may  not quite make the grade. We think you\u2019re wonderful,  but the theater is full of young girls whose parents  thought they were the most talented things  alive; girls who won all kinds of applause in high-school  and college plays; girls who have everything  except luck. You may be one of these girls, and if you  are, we want you to be prepared for it. We want you  to have something to fall back on, just in case  you ever need it.\u201d\n\n\n Mr. Lane, seeing Peggy\u2019s hurt look, was quick to  step in with reassurance. \u201cWe don\u2019t think you\u2019re going  to fail, Peg. We have every confidence in you and  your talents. I don\u2019t see how you could miss being the  biggest success ever\u2014but I\u2019m your father, not a  Broadway critic or a play producer, and I could be  wrong. And if I am wrong, I don\u2019t want you to be  hurt. All I ask is that you finish college and get a  teacher\u2019s certificate so that you can always find  useful work if you have to. Then you can try your  luck in the theater. Doesn\u2019t that make sense?\u201d\n\n4\n\n Peggy stared at the faded linoleum on the floor for  a few moments before answering. Then, looking first  at her mother and then at her father, she replied  firmly, \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t! It might make sense if we  were talking about anything else but acting, but  we\u2019re not. If I\u2019m ever going to try, I\u2019ll have a better  chance now than I will in three years. But I can see  your point of view, Dad, and I\u2019ll tell you what\u2014I\u2019ll  make a bargain with you.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat sort of bargain, Peg?\u201d her father asked curiously.\n\n\n \u201cIf you let me go to New York now, and if I can get  into a good drama school there, I\u2019ll study and try to  find acting jobs at the same time. That way I\u2019ll still be  going to school and I\u2019ll be giving myself a chance.  And if I\u2019m not started in a career in one year, I\u2019ll go  back to college and get my teacher\u2019s certificate before  I try the theater again. How does that sound to  you?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt sounds fair enough,\u201d Tom Lane admitted, \u201cbut  are you so confident that you\u2019ll see results in one  year? After all, some of our top stars worked many  times that long before getting any recognition.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t expect recognition in one year, Dad,\u201d  Peggy said. \u201cI\u2019m not that conceited or that silly. All  I hope is that I\u2019ll be able to get a part in that time,  and maybe be able to make a living out of acting.  And that\u2019s probably asking too much. If I have to,  I\u2019ll make a living at something else, maybe working  in an office or something, while I wait for parts. What  I want to prove in this year is that I can act. If I can\u2019t,  I\u2019ll come home.\u201d\n\n5\n\n \u201cIt seems to me, Tom, that Margaret has a pretty  good idea of what she\u2019s doing,\u201d Mrs. Lane said. \u201cShe  sounds sensible and practical. If she were all starry-eyed  and expected to see her name in lights in a few  weeks, I\u2019d vote against her going, but I\u2019m beginning  to think that maybe she\u2019s right about this being the  best time.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, Mother!\u201d Peggy shouted, jumping down from  the stool and throwing her arms about her mother\u2019s  neck. \u201cI knew you\u2019d understand! And you understand  too, don\u2019t you, Dad?\u201d she appealed.\n\n\n Her father replied in little puffs as he drew on his  pipe to get it started. \u201cI ... never said ... I didn\u2019t  ... understand you ... did I?\u201d His pipe satisfactorily  sending up thick clouds of fragrant smoke, he  took it out of his mouth before continuing more  evenly.\n\n\n \u201cPeg, your mother and I are cautious only because  we love you so much and want what\u2019s going to make  you happy. At the same time, we want to spare you  any unnecessary unhappiness along the way. Remember,  I\u2019m not a complete stranger to show business.  Before I came out here to Rockport to edit the Eagle ,  I worked as a reporter on one of the best papers in  New York. I saw a lot ... I met a lot of actors and  actresses ... and I know how hard the city often  was for them. But I don\u2019t want to protect you from  life. That\u2019s no good either. Just let me think about it  a little longer and let me talk to your mother some  more.\u201d\n\n6\n\n Mrs. Lane patted Peggy\u2019s arm and said, \u201cWe won\u2019t  keep you in suspense long, dear. Why don\u2019t you go  out for a walk for a while and let us go over the situation  quietly? We\u2019ll decide before bedtime.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy nodded silently and walked to the kitchen  door, where she paused to say, \u201cI\u2019m just going out to  the barn to see if Socks is all right for the night. Then  maybe I\u2019ll go down to Jean\u2019s for a while.\u201d\n\n\n As she stepped out into the soft summer dusk she  turned to look back just in time to see her mother  throw her a comically exaggerated wink of assurance.  Feeling much better, Peggy shut the screen door behind  her and started for the barn.\n\n\n Ever since she had been a little girl, the barn had  been Peggy\u2019s favorite place to go to be by herself and  think. Its musty but clean scent of straw and horses  and leather made her feel calm and alive. Breathing  in its odor gratefully, she walked into the half-dark to  Socks\u2019s stall. As the little bay horse heard her coming,  she stamped one foot and softly whinnied a greeting.  Peggy stopped first at the bag that hung on the wall  among the bridles and halters and took out a lump of  sugar as a present. Then, after stroking Socks\u2019s silky  nose, she held out her palm with the sugar cube.  Socks took it eagerly and pushed her nose against  Peggy\u2019s hand in appreciation.\n\n\n As Peggy mixed some oats and barley for her pet  and checked to see that there was enough straw in  the stall, she thought about her life in Rockport and  the new life that she might soon be going to.\n\n7\n\n Rockport, Wisconsin, was a fine place, as pretty a  small town as any girl could ask to grow up in. And  not too small, either, Peggy thought. Its 16,500 people  supported good schools, an excellent library, and two  good movie houses. What\u2019s more, the Rockport Community  College attracted theater groups and concert  artists, so that life in the town had always been stimulating.  And of course, all of this was in addition to the  usual growing-up pleasures of swimming and sailing,  movie dates, and formal dances\u2014everything that a  girl could want.\n\n\n Peggy had lived all her life here, knew every tree-shaded  street, every country road, field, lake, and  stream. All of her friends were here, friends she had  known since her earliest baby days. It would be hard  to leave them, she knew, but there was no doubt in  her mind that she was going to do so. If not now, then  as soon as she possibly could.\n\n\n It was not any dissatisfaction with her life, her  friends, or her home that made Peggy want to leave  Rockport. She was not running away from anything,  she reminded herself; she was running to something.\n\n\n To what? To the bright lights, speeding taxis, glittering  towers of a make-believe movie-set New York?  Would it really be like that? Or would it be something  different, something like the dreary side-street  world of failure and defeat that she had also seen in  movies?\n\n8\n\n Seeing the image of herself hungry and tired, going  from office to office looking for a part in a play,  Peggy suddenly laughed aloud and brought herself  back to reality, to the warm barn smell and the big,  soft-eyed gaze of Socks. She threw her arm around  the smooth bay neck and laid her face next to the  horse\u2019s cheek.\n\n\n \u201cSocks,\u201d she murmured, \u201cI need some of your horse  sense if I\u2019m going to go out on my own! We\u2019ll go  for a fast run in the morning and see if some fresh air  won\u2019t clear my silly mind!\u201d\n\n\n With a final pat, she left the stall and the barn behind,  stepping out into the deepening dusk. It was  still too early to go back to the house to see if her parents  had reached a decision about her future. Fighting  down an impulse to rush right into the kitchen to  see how they were coming along, Peggy continued  down the driveway and turned left on the slate sidewalk  past the front porch of her family\u2019s old farmhouse  and down the street toward Jean Wilson\u2019s  house at the end of the block.\n\n\n As she walked by her own home, she noticed with  a familiar tug at her heart how the lilac bushes on  the front lawn broke up the light from the windows  behind them into a pattern of leafy lace. For a moment,  or maybe a little more, she wondered why she  wanted to leave this. What for? What could ever be  better?\n\n9 II Dramatic Decision Upstairs at the Wilsons\u2019, Peggy found Jean swathed  in bath towels, washing her long, straight red hair,  which was now white with lather and piled up in a  high, soapy knot.\n\n\n \u201cYou just washed it yesterday!\u201d Peggy said. \u201cAre  you doing it again\u2014or still?\u201d\n\n\n Jean grinned, her eyes shut tight against the soapsuds.  \u201cAgain, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d she answered. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s  a nervous habit!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder you\u2019re not bald, with all the rubbing  you give your hair,\u201d Peggy said with a laugh.\n\n\n \u201cWell, if I do go bald, at least it will be with a  clean scalp!\u201d Jean answered with a humorous crinkle  of her freckled nose. Taking a deep breath and puffing  out her cheeks comically, she plunged her head  into the basin and rinsed off the soap with a shampoo  hose. When she came up at last, dripping-wet  hair was tightly plastered to the back of her head.\n\n\n \u201cThere!\u201d she announced. \u201cDon\u2019t I look beautiful?\u201d\n\n10\n\n After a brisk rubdown with one towel, Jean rolled  another dry towel around her head like an Indian  turban. Then, having wrapped herself in an ancient,  tattered, plaid bathrobe, she led Peggy out of the  steamy room and into her cozy, if somewhat cluttered,  bedroom. When they had made themselves  comfortable on the pillow-strewn daybeds, Jean came  straight to the point.\n\n\n \u201cSo the grand debate is still going on, is it? When  do you think they\u2019ll make up their minds?\u201d she asked.\n\n\n \u201cHow do you know they haven\u2019t decided anything  yet?\u201d Peggy said, in a puzzled tone.\n\n\n \u201cOh, that didn\u2019t take much deduction, my dear  Watson,\u201d Jean laughed. \u201cIf they had decided against  the New York trip, your face would be as long as  Socks\u2019s nose, and it\u2019s not half that long. And if the answer  was yes, I wouldn\u2019t have to wait to hear about it!  You would have been flying around the room and  talking a mile a minute. So I figured that nothing was  decided yet.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou know, if I were as smart as you,\u201d Peggy said  thoughtfully, \u201cI would have figured out a way to convince  Mother and Dad by now.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, don\u2019t feel bad about being dumb,\u201d Jean said in  mock tones of comfort. \u201cIf I were as pretty and talented  as you are, I wouldn\u2019t need brains, either!\u201d  With a hoot of laughter, she rolled quickly aside on  the couch to avoid the pillow that Peggy threw at  her.\n\n\n A short, breathless pillow fight followed, leaving  the girls limp with laughter and with Jean having to  retie her towel turban. From her new position, flat on  the floor, Peggy looked up at her friend with a rueful  smile.\n\n11\n\n \u201cYou know, I sometimes think that we haven\u2019t  grown up at all!\u201d she said. \u201cI can hardly blame my  parents for thinking twice\u2014and a lot more\u2014before  treating me like an adult.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNonsense!\u201d Jean replied firmly. \u201cYour parents  know a lot better than to confuse being stuffy with  being grown-up and responsible. And, besides, I  know that they\u2019re not the least bit worried about your  being able to take care of yourself. I heard them talking  with my folks last night, and they haven\u2019t got a  doubt in the world about you. But they know how  hard it can be to get a start as an actress, and they  want to be sure that you have a profession in case  you don\u2019t get a break in show business.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI know,\u201d Peggy answered. \u201cWe had a long talk  about it this evening after dinner.\u201d Then she told her  friend about the conversation and her proposed \u201cbargain\u201d  with her parents.\n\n\n \u201cThey both seemed to think it was fair,\u201d she concluded,  \u201cand when I went out, they were talking it  over. They promised me an answer by bedtime, and  I\u2019m over here waiting until the jury comes in with its  decision. You know,\u201d she said suddenly, sitting up  on the floor and crossing her legs under her, \u201cI bet  they wouldn\u2019t hesitate a minute if you would only  change your mind and decide to come with me and  try it too!\u201d\n\n12\n\n After a moment\u2019s thoughtful silence, Jean answered  slowly, \u201cNo, Peg. I\u2019ve thought this all out before,  and I know it would be as wrong for me as it is  right for you. I know we had a lot of fun in the dramatic  groups, and I guess I was pretty good as a  comedienne in a couple of the plays, but I know I  haven\u2019t got the real professional thing\u2014and I know  that you have. In fact, the only professional talent I  think I do have for the theater is the ability to recognize  talent when I see it\u2014and to recognize that it\u2019s  not there when it isn\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut, Jean,\u201d Peggy protested, \u201cyou can handle  comedy and character lines as well as anyone I  know!\u201d\n\n\n Jean nodded, accepting the compliment and seeming  at the same time to brush it off. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t  matter. You know even better than I that there\u2019s a lot  more to being an actress\u2014a successful one\u2014than  reading lines well. There\u2019s the ability to make the  audience sit up and notice you the minute you walk  on, whether you have lines or not. And that\u2019s something  you can\u2019t learn; you either have it, or you  don\u2019t. It\u2019s like being double-jointed. I can make an  audience laugh when I have good lines, but you can  make them look at you and respond to you and be  with you all the way, even with bad lines. That\u2019s  why you\u2019re going to go to New York and be an actress.  And that\u2019s why I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut, Jean\u2014\u201d Peggy began.\n\n13\n\n \u201cNo buts!\u201d Jean cut in. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this  enough before, and I\u2019m not going to change my  mind. I\u2019m as sure about what I want as you are about  what you want. I\u2019m going to finish college and get my  certificate as an English teacher.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cAnd what about acting? Can you get it out of  your mind as easily as all that?\u201d Peggy asked.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s the dark and devious part of my plan,\u201d  Jean answered with a mysterious laugh that ended in  a comic witch\u2019s cackle and an unconvincing witch-look  that was completely out of place on her round,  freckled face. \u201cOnce I get into a high school as an  English teacher, I\u2019m going to try to teach a special  course in the literature of the theater and maybe another  one in stagecraft. I\u2019m going to work with the  high-school drama group and put on plays. That way,  I\u2019ll be in a spot where I can use my special talent of  recognizing talent. And that way,\u201d she added, becoming  much more serious, \u201cI have a chance really to  do something for the theater. If I can help and encourage  one or two people with real talent like yours,  then I\u2019ll feel that I\u2019ve really done something worth  while.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy nodded silently, not trusting herself to  speak for fear of saying something foolishly sentimental,  or even of crying. Her friend\u2019s earnestness about  the importance of her work and her faith in Peggy\u2019s  talent had touched her more than she could say.\n\n14\n\n The silence lasted what seemed a terribly long  time, until Jean broke it by suddenly jumping up and  flinging a last pillow which she had been hiding behind  her back. Running out of the bedroom, she  called, \u201cCome on! I\u2019ll race you down to the kitchen  for cocoa! By the time we\u2019re finished, it\u2019ll be about  time for your big Hour of Decision scene!\u201d It was nearly ten o\u2019clock when Peggy finally felt  that her parents had had enough time to talk things  out. Leaving the Wilson house, she walked slowly  despite her eagerness, trying in all fairness to give her  mother and father every minute she could. Reaching  her home, she cut across the lawn behind the lilac  bushes, to the steps up to the broad porch that  fronted the house. As she climbed the steps, she  heard her father\u2019s voice raised a little above its normal  soft, deep tone, but she could not make out the  words.\n\n\n Crossing the porch, she caught sight of him  through the window. He was speaking on the telephone,  and now she caught his words.\n\n\n \u201cFine. Yes.... Yes\u2014I think we can. Very  well, day after tomorrow, then. That\u2019s right\u2014all  three of us. And, May\u2014it\u2019ll be good to see you again,  after all these years! Good-by.\u201d\n\n\n As Peggy entered the room, her father put down  the phone and turned to Mrs. Lane. \u201cWell, Betty,\u201d  he said, \u201cit\u2019s all set.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s all set, Dad?\u201d Peggy said, breaking into a  run to her father\u2019s side.\n\n15\n\n \u201cEverything\u2019s all set, Peg,\u201d her father said with a  grin. \u201cAnd it\u2019s set just the way you wanted it! There\u2019s  not a man in the world who can hold out against  two determined women.\u201d He leaned back against the  fireplace mantel, waiting for the explosion he felt  sure was to follow his announcement. But Peggy just  stood, hardly moving a muscle. Then she walked  carefully, as if she were on the deck of a rolling ship,  to the big easy chair and slowly sat down.\n\n\n \u201cWell, for goodness\u2019 sake!\u201d her mother cried.  \u201cWhere\u2019s the enthusiasm?\u201d\n\n\n Peggy swallowed hard before answering. When  her voice came, it sounded strange, about two tones  higher than usual. \u201cI ... I\u2019m trying to be sedate ... and  poised ... and very grown-up,\u201d she said.  \u201cBut it\u2019s not easy. All I want to do is to\u2014\u201d and she  jumped out of the chair\u2014\u201cto yell whoopee !\u201d She  yelled at the top of her lungs.\n\n\n After the kisses, the hugs, and the first excitement,  Peggy and her parents adjourned to the kitchen, the  favorite household conference room, for cookies and  milk and more talk.\n\n\n \u201cNow, tell me, Dad,\u201d Peggy asked, her mouth full  of oatmeal cookies, no longer \u201csedate\u201d or \u201cpoised,\u201d  but her natural, bubbling self. \u201cWho was that on the  phone, and where are the three of us going, and  what\u2019s all set?\u201d\n\n16\n\n \u201cOne thing at a time,\u201d her father said. \u201cTo begin  with, we decided almost as soon as you left that we  were going to let you go to New York to try a year\u2019s  experience in the theater. But then we had to decide  just where you would live, and where you should  study, and how much money you would need, and a  whole lot of other things. So I called New York to talk  to an old friend of mine who I felt would be able to  give us some help. Her name is May Berriman, and  she\u2019s spent all her life in the theater. In fact, she was  a very successful actress. Now she\u2019s been retired for  some years, but I thought she might give us some  good advice.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cAnd did she?\u201d Peggy asked.\n\n\n \u201cWe were luckier than I would have thought possible,\u201d  Mrs. Lane put in. \u201cIt seems that May bought a  big, old-fashioned town house and converted it into  a rooming house especially for young actresses. She  always wanted a house of her own with a garden in  back, but felt it was foolish for a woman living alone.  This way, she can afford to run a big place and at  the same time not be alone. And best of all, she says  she has a room that you can have!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, Mother! It sounds wonderful!\u201d Peggy exulted.  \u201cI\u2019ll be with other girls my own age who are actresses,  and living with an experienced actress! I\u2019ll bet she  can teach me loads!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m sure she can,\u201d her father said. \u201cAnd so can  the New York Dramatic Academy.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cDad!\u201d Peggy shouted, almost choking on a cooky.  \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve managed to get me accepted  there! That\u2019s the best dramatic school in the country!  How\u2014?\u201d\n\n17\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t get too excited, Peg,\u201d Mr. Lane interrupted.  \u201cYou\u2019re not accepted anywhere yet, but May  Berriman told me that the Academy is the best place  to study acting, and she said she would set up an  audition for you in two days. The term starts in a  couple of weeks, so there isn\u2019t much time to lose.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTwo days! Do you mean we\u2019ll be going to New  York day after tomorrow, just like that?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, no,\u201d her mother answered calmly. \u201cWe\u2019re going  to New York tomorrow on the first plane that we  can get seats on. Your father doesn\u2019t believe in wasting  time, once his mind is made up.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTomorrow?\u201d Peggy repeated, almost unable to believe  what she had heard. \u201cWhat are we sitting here  talking for, then? I\u2019ve got a million things to do! I\u2019ve  got to get packed ... I\u2019ve got to think of what to  read for the audition! I can study on the plane, I  guess, but ... oh! I\u2019ll be terrible in a reading unless  I can have more time! Oh, Mother, what parts  will I do? Where\u2019s the Shakespeare? Where\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhoa!\u201d Mr. Lane said, catching Peggy\u2019s arm to  prevent her from rushing out of the kitchen. \u201cNot  now, young lady! We\u2019ll pack in the morning, talk  about what you should read, and take an afternoon  plane to New York. But tonight, you\u2019d better think  of nothing more than getting to bed. This is going to  be a busy time for all of us.\u201d\n\n\n Reluctantly, Peggy agreed, recognizing the sense  of what her father said. She finished her milk and  cookies, kissed her parents good night and went upstairs  to bed.\n\n\n But it was one thing to go to bed and another to  go to sleep.\n\n18\n\n Peggy lay on her back, staring at the ceiling and  the patterns of light and shade cast by the street  lamp outside as it shone through the leaves of the big  maple tree. As she watched the shifting shadows,  she reviewed the roles she had played since her first  time in a high-school play. Which should she refresh  herself on? Which ones would she do best? And  which ones were most suited to her now? She recognized  that she had grown and developed past some  of the roles which had once seemed perfectly suited  to her talent and her appearance. But both had  changed. She was certainly not a mature actress  yet, from any point of view, but neither was she a  schoolgirl. Her trim figure was well formed; her face  had lost the undefined, simple cuteness of the early  teens, and had gained character. She didn\u2019t think she  should read a young romantic part like Juliet. Not  that she couldn\u2019t do it, but perhaps something  sharper was called for.\n\n\n Perhaps Viola in Twelfth Night ? Or perhaps not  Shakespeare at all. Maybe the people at the Academy  would think she was too arty or too pretentious?  Maybe she should do something dramatic and full of  stormy emotion, like Blanche in A Streetcar Named  Desire ? Or, better for her development and age, a  light, brittle, comedy role...?\n\n19\n\n Nothing seemed quite right. Peggy\u2019s thoughts  shifted with the shadows overhead. All the plays she  had ever seen or read or acted in melted together in  a blur, until the characters from one seemed to be  talking with the characters from another and moving  about in an enormous set made of pieces from two or  three different plays. More actors kept coming on in  a fantastic assortment of costumes until the stage was  full. Then the stage lights dimmed, the actors joined  hands across the stage to bow, the curtain slowly  descended, the lights went out\u2014and Peggy was fast  asleep. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich of these sets of descriptions best describes Peggy?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She's talented, unwise, and creative\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She's dedicated, bold, and pretty\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She's dedicated, bold, and pretty\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She's dedicated, bold, and pretty\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It\u2019s just that decisions  like this can\u2019t be made quickly.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut, Dad!\u201d Peggy almost wailed. \u201cYou just finished  saying yourself that I\u2019ve been thinking about  this and wanting it for years! You can\u2019t follow that by  calling it a quick decision!\u201d She turned to her mother,  her hazel eyes flashing under a mass of dark chestnut  curls. \u201cMother, you understand, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\n Mrs. Lane smiled gently and placed her soft white  hand on her daughter\u2019s lean brown one. \u201cOf course  I understand, Margaret, and so does your father. We  both want to do what\u2019s best for you, not to stand in  your way. The only question is whether the time is  right, or if you should wait longer.\u201d\n\n2\n\n \u201cWait! Mother\u2014Dad\u2014I\u2019m years behind already!  The theater is full of beginners a year and even two  years younger than I am, and girls of my age have  lots of acting credits already. Besides, what is there to  wait for?\u201d\n\n\n Peggy\u2019s father put down his coffee cup and leaned  back in the kitchen chair until it tilted on two legs  against the wall behind him. He took his time before  answering. When he finally spoke, his voice was  warm and slow.\n\n\n \u201cPeg, I don\u2019t want to hold up your career. I don\u2019t  have any objections to your wanting to act. I think\u2014judging  from the plays I\u2019ve seen you in at high  school and college\u2014that you have a real talent. But  I thought that if you would go on with college for  three more years and get your degree, you would  gain so much worth-while knowledge that you\u2019d use  and enjoy for the rest of your life\u2014\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut not acting knowledge!\u201d Peggy cried.\n\n\n \u201cThere\u2019s more to life than that,\u201d her father put in.  \u201cThere\u2019s history and literature and foreign languages  and mathematics and sciences and music and art  and philosophy and a lot more\u2014all of them fascinating  and all important.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNone of them is as fascinating as acting to me,\u201d  Peggy replied, \u201cand none of them is nearly as important  to my life.\u201d\n\n3\n\n Mrs. Lane nodded. \u201cOf course, dear. I know just  how you feel about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI would have answered  just the same way when I was your age, except  that for me it was singing instead of acting. But\u2014\u201d and  here her pleasant face betrayed a trace of  sadness\u2014\u201cbut I was never able to be a singer. I guess  I wasn\u2019t quite good enough or else I didn\u2019t really  want it hard enough\u2014to go on with all the study and  practice it needed.\u201d\n\n\n She paused and looked thoughtfully at her daughter\u2019s  intense expression, then took a deep breath before  going on.\n\n\n \u201cWhat you must realize, Margaret, is that you may  not quite make the grade. We think you\u2019re wonderful,  but the theater is full of young girls whose parents  thought they were the most talented things  alive; girls who won all kinds of applause in high-school  and college plays; girls who have everything  except luck. You may be one of these girls, and if you  are, we want you to be prepared for it. We want you  to have something to fall back on, just in case  you ever need it.\u201d\n\n\n Mr. Lane, seeing Peggy\u2019s hurt look, was quick to  step in with reassurance. \u201cWe don\u2019t think you\u2019re going  to fail, Peg. We have every confidence in you and  your talents. I don\u2019t see how you could miss being the  biggest success ever\u2014but I\u2019m your father, not a  Broadway critic or a play producer, and I could be  wrong. And if I am wrong, I don\u2019t want you to be  hurt. All I ask is that you finish college and get a  teacher\u2019s certificate so that you can always find  useful work if you have to. Then you can try your  luck in the theater. Doesn\u2019t that make sense?\u201d\n\n4\n\n Peggy stared at the faded linoleum on the floor for  a few moments before answering. Then, looking first  at her mother and then at her father, she replied  firmly, \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t! It might make sense if we  were talking about anything else but acting, but  we\u2019re not. If I\u2019m ever going to try, I\u2019ll have a better  chance now than I will in three years. But I can see  your point of view, Dad, and I\u2019ll tell you what\u2014I\u2019ll  make a bargain with you.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat sort of bargain, Peg?\u201d her father asked curiously.\n\n\n \u201cIf you let me go to New York now, and if I can get  into a good drama school there, I\u2019ll study and try to  find acting jobs at the same time. That way I\u2019ll still be  going to school and I\u2019ll be giving myself a chance.  And if I\u2019m not started in a career in one year, I\u2019ll go  back to college and get my teacher\u2019s certificate before  I try the theater again. How does that sound to  you?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt sounds fair enough,\u201d Tom Lane admitted, \u201cbut  are you so confident that you\u2019ll see results in one  year? After all, some of our top stars worked many  times that long before getting any recognition.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t expect recognition in one year, Dad,\u201d  Peggy said. \u201cI\u2019m not that conceited or that silly. All  I hope is that I\u2019ll be able to get a part in that time,  and maybe be able to make a living out of acting.  And that\u2019s probably asking too much. If I have to,  I\u2019ll make a living at something else, maybe working  in an office or something, while I wait for parts. What  I want to prove in this year is that I can act. If I can\u2019t,  I\u2019ll come home.\u201d\n\n5\n\n \u201cIt seems to me, Tom, that Margaret has a pretty  good idea of what she\u2019s doing,\u201d Mrs. Lane said. \u201cShe  sounds sensible and practical. If she were all starry-eyed  and expected to see her name in lights in a few  weeks, I\u2019d vote against her going, but I\u2019m beginning  to think that maybe she\u2019s right about this being the  best time.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, Mother!\u201d Peggy shouted, jumping down from  the stool and throwing her arms about her mother\u2019s  neck. \u201cI knew you\u2019d understand! And you understand  too, don\u2019t you, Dad?\u201d she appealed.\n\n\n Her father replied in little puffs as he drew on his  pipe to get it started. \u201cI ... never said ... I didn\u2019t  ... understand you ... did I?\u201d His pipe satisfactorily  sending up thick clouds of fragrant smoke, he  took it out of his mouth before continuing more  evenly.\n\n\n \u201cPeg, your mother and I are cautious only because  we love you so much and want what\u2019s going to make  you happy. At the same time, we want to spare you  any unnecessary unhappiness along the way. Remember,  I\u2019m not a complete stranger to show business.  Before I came out here to Rockport to edit the Eagle ,  I worked as a reporter on one of the best papers in  New York. I saw a lot ... I met a lot of actors and  actresses ... and I know how hard the city often  was for them. But I don\u2019t want to protect you from  life. That\u2019s no good either. Just let me think about it  a little longer and let me talk to your mother some  more.\u201d\n\n6\n\n Mrs. Lane patted Peggy\u2019s arm and said, \u201cWe won\u2019t  keep you in suspense long, dear. Why don\u2019t you go  out for a walk for a while and let us go over the situation  quietly? We\u2019ll decide before bedtime.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy nodded silently and walked to the kitchen  door, where she paused to say, \u201cI\u2019m just going out to  the barn to see if Socks is all right for the night. Then  maybe I\u2019ll go down to Jean\u2019s for a while.\u201d\n\n\n As she stepped out into the soft summer dusk she  turned to look back just in time to see her mother  throw her a comically exaggerated wink of assurance.  Feeling much better, Peggy shut the screen door behind  her and started for the barn.\n\n\n Ever since she had been a little girl, the barn had  been Peggy\u2019s favorite place to go to be by herself and  think. Its musty but clean scent of straw and horses  and leather made her feel calm and alive. Breathing  in its odor gratefully, she walked into the half-dark to  Socks\u2019s stall. As the little bay horse heard her coming,  she stamped one foot and softly whinnied a greeting.  Peggy stopped first at the bag that hung on the wall  among the bridles and halters and took out a lump of  sugar as a present. Then, after stroking Socks\u2019s silky  nose, she held out her palm with the sugar cube.  Socks took it eagerly and pushed her nose against  Peggy\u2019s hand in appreciation.\n\n\n As Peggy mixed some oats and barley for her pet  and checked to see that there was enough straw in  the stall, she thought about her life in Rockport and  the new life that she might soon be going to.\n\n7\n\n Rockport, Wisconsin, was a fine place, as pretty a  small town as any girl could ask to grow up in. And  not too small, either, Peggy thought. Its 16,500 people  supported good schools, an excellent library, and two  good movie houses. What\u2019s more, the Rockport Community  College attracted theater groups and concert  artists, so that life in the town had always been stimulating.  And of course, all of this was in addition to the  usual growing-up pleasures of swimming and sailing,  movie dates, and formal dances\u2014everything that a  girl could want.\n\n\n Peggy had lived all her life here, knew every tree-shaded  street, every country road, field, lake, and  stream. All of her friends were here, friends she had  known since her earliest baby days. It would be hard  to leave them, she knew, but there was no doubt in  her mind that she was going to do so. If not now, then  as soon as she possibly could.\n\n\n It was not any dissatisfaction with her life, her  friends, or her home that made Peggy want to leave  Rockport. She was not running away from anything,  she reminded herself; she was running to something.\n\n\n To what? To the bright lights, speeding taxis, glittering  towers of a make-believe movie-set New York?  Would it really be like that? Or would it be something  different, something like the dreary side-street  world of failure and defeat that she had also seen in  movies?\n\n8\n\n Seeing the image of herself hungry and tired, going  from office to office looking for a part in a play,  Peggy suddenly laughed aloud and brought herself  back to reality, to the warm barn smell and the big,  soft-eyed gaze of Socks. She threw her arm around  the smooth bay neck and laid her face next to the  horse\u2019s cheek.\n\n\n \u201cSocks,\u201d she murmured, \u201cI need some of your horse  sense if I\u2019m going to go out on my own! We\u2019ll go  for a fast run in the morning and see if some fresh air  won\u2019t clear my silly mind!\u201d\n\n\n With a final pat, she left the stall and the barn behind,  stepping out into the deepening dusk. It was  still too early to go back to the house to see if her parents  had reached a decision about her future. Fighting  down an impulse to rush right into the kitchen to  see how they were coming along, Peggy continued  down the driveway and turned left on the slate sidewalk  past the front porch of her family\u2019s old farmhouse  and down the street toward Jean Wilson\u2019s  house at the end of the block.\n\n\n As she walked by her own home, she noticed with  a familiar tug at her heart how the lilac bushes on  the front lawn broke up the light from the windows  behind them into a pattern of leafy lace. For a moment,  or maybe a little more, she wondered why she  wanted to leave this. What for? What could ever be  better?\n\n9 II Dramatic Decision Upstairs at the Wilsons\u2019, Peggy found Jean swathed  in bath towels, washing her long, straight red hair,  which was now white with lather and piled up in a  high, soapy knot.\n\n\n \u201cYou just washed it yesterday!\u201d Peggy said. \u201cAre  you doing it again\u2014or still?\u201d\n\n\n Jean grinned, her eyes shut tight against the soapsuds.  \u201cAgain, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d she answered. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s  a nervous habit!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder you\u2019re not bald, with all the rubbing  you give your hair,\u201d Peggy said with a laugh.\n\n\n \u201cWell, if I do go bald, at least it will be with a  clean scalp!\u201d Jean answered with a humorous crinkle  of her freckled nose. Taking a deep breath and puffing  out her cheeks comically, she plunged her head  into the basin and rinsed off the soap with a shampoo  hose. When she came up at last, dripping-wet  hair was tightly plastered to the back of her head.\n\n\n \u201cThere!\u201d she announced. \u201cDon\u2019t I look beautiful?\u201d\n\n10\n\n After a brisk rubdown with one towel, Jean rolled  another dry towel around her head like an Indian  turban. Then, having wrapped herself in an ancient,  tattered, plaid bathrobe, she led Peggy out of the  steamy room and into her cozy, if somewhat cluttered,  bedroom. When they had made themselves  comfortable on the pillow-strewn daybeds, Jean came  straight to the point.\n\n\n \u201cSo the grand debate is still going on, is it? When  do you think they\u2019ll make up their minds?\u201d she asked.\n\n\n \u201cHow do you know they haven\u2019t decided anything  yet?\u201d Peggy said, in a puzzled tone.\n\n\n \u201cOh, that didn\u2019t take much deduction, my dear  Watson,\u201d Jean laughed. \u201cIf they had decided against  the New York trip, your face would be as long as  Socks\u2019s nose, and it\u2019s not half that long. And if the answer  was yes, I wouldn\u2019t have to wait to hear about it!  You would have been flying around the room and  talking a mile a minute. So I figured that nothing was  decided yet.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou know, if I were as smart as you,\u201d Peggy said  thoughtfully, \u201cI would have figured out a way to convince  Mother and Dad by now.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, don\u2019t feel bad about being dumb,\u201d Jean said in  mock tones of comfort. \u201cIf I were as pretty and talented  as you are, I wouldn\u2019t need brains, either!\u201d  With a hoot of laughter, she rolled quickly aside on  the couch to avoid the pillow that Peggy threw at  her.\n\n\n A short, breathless pillow fight followed, leaving  the girls limp with laughter and with Jean having to  retie her towel turban. From her new position, flat on  the floor, Peggy looked up at her friend with a rueful  smile.\n\n11\n\n \u201cYou know, I sometimes think that we haven\u2019t  grown up at all!\u201d she said. \u201cI can hardly blame my  parents for thinking twice\u2014and a lot more\u2014before  treating me like an adult.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNonsense!\u201d Jean replied firmly. \u201cYour parents  know a lot better than to confuse being stuffy with  being grown-up and responsible. And, besides, I  know that they\u2019re not the least bit worried about your  being able to take care of yourself. I heard them talking  with my folks last night, and they haven\u2019t got a  doubt in the world about you. But they know how  hard it can be to get a start as an actress, and they  want to be sure that you have a profession in case  you don\u2019t get a break in show business.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI know,\u201d Peggy answered. \u201cWe had a long talk  about it this evening after dinner.\u201d Then she told her  friend about the conversation and her proposed \u201cbargain\u201d  with her parents.\n\n\n \u201cThey both seemed to think it was fair,\u201d she concluded,  \u201cand when I went out, they were talking it  over. They promised me an answer by bedtime, and  I\u2019m over here waiting until the jury comes in with its  decision. You know,\u201d she said suddenly, sitting up  on the floor and crossing her legs under her, \u201cI bet  they wouldn\u2019t hesitate a minute if you would only  change your mind and decide to come with me and  try it too!\u201d\n\n12\n\n After a moment\u2019s thoughtful silence, Jean answered  slowly, \u201cNo, Peg. I\u2019ve thought this all out before,  and I know it would be as wrong for me as it is  right for you. I know we had a lot of fun in the dramatic  groups, and I guess I was pretty good as a  comedienne in a couple of the plays, but I know I  haven\u2019t got the real professional thing\u2014and I know  that you have. In fact, the only professional talent I  think I do have for the theater is the ability to recognize  talent when I see it\u2014and to recognize that it\u2019s  not there when it isn\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut, Jean,\u201d Peggy protested, \u201cyou can handle  comedy and character lines as well as anyone I  know!\u201d\n\n\n Jean nodded, accepting the compliment and seeming  at the same time to brush it off. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t  matter. You know even better than I that there\u2019s a lot  more to being an actress\u2014a successful one\u2014than  reading lines well. There\u2019s the ability to make the  audience sit up and notice you the minute you walk  on, whether you have lines or not. And that\u2019s something  you can\u2019t learn; you either have it, or you  don\u2019t. It\u2019s like being double-jointed. I can make an  audience laugh when I have good lines, but you can  make them look at you and respond to you and be  with you all the way, even with bad lines. That\u2019s  why you\u2019re going to go to New York and be an actress.  And that\u2019s why I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut, Jean\u2014\u201d Peggy began.\n\n13\n\n \u201cNo buts!\u201d Jean cut in. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this  enough before, and I\u2019m not going to change my  mind. I\u2019m as sure about what I want as you are about  what you want. I\u2019m going to finish college and get my  certificate as an English teacher.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cAnd what about acting? Can you get it out of  your mind as easily as all that?\u201d Peggy asked.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s the dark and devious part of my plan,\u201d  Jean answered with a mysterious laugh that ended in  a comic witch\u2019s cackle and an unconvincing witch-look  that was completely out of place on her round,  freckled face. \u201cOnce I get into a high school as an  English teacher, I\u2019m going to try to teach a special  course in the literature of the theater and maybe another  one in stagecraft. I\u2019m going to work with the  high-school drama group and put on plays. That way,  I\u2019ll be in a spot where I can use my special talent of  recognizing talent. And that way,\u201d she added, becoming  much more serious, \u201cI have a chance really to  do something for the theater. If I can help and encourage  one or two people with real talent like yours,  then I\u2019ll feel that I\u2019ve really done something worth  while.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy nodded silently, not trusting herself to  speak for fear of saying something foolishly sentimental,  or even of crying. Her friend\u2019s earnestness about  the importance of her work and her faith in Peggy\u2019s  talent had touched her more than she could say.\n\n14\n\n The silence lasted what seemed a terribly long  time, until Jean broke it by suddenly jumping up and  flinging a last pillow which she had been hiding behind  her back. Running out of the bedroom, she  called, \u201cCome on! I\u2019ll race you down to the kitchen  for cocoa! By the time we\u2019re finished, it\u2019ll be about  time for your big Hour of Decision scene!\u201d It was nearly ten o\u2019clock when Peggy finally felt  that her parents had had enough time to talk things  out. Leaving the Wilson house, she walked slowly  despite her eagerness, trying in all fairness to give her  mother and father every minute she could. Reaching  her home, she cut across the lawn behind the lilac  bushes, to the steps up to the broad porch that  fronted the house. As she climbed the steps, she  heard her father\u2019s voice raised a little above its normal  soft, deep tone, but she could not make out the  words.\n\n\n Crossing the porch, she caught sight of him  through the window. He was speaking on the telephone,  and now she caught his words.\n\n\n \u201cFine. Yes.... Yes\u2014I think we can. Very  well, day after tomorrow, then. That\u2019s right\u2014all  three of us. And, May\u2014it\u2019ll be good to see you again,  after all these years! Good-by.\u201d\n\n\n As Peggy entered the room, her father put down  the phone and turned to Mrs. Lane. \u201cWell, Betty,\u201d  he said, \u201cit\u2019s all set.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s all set, Dad?\u201d Peggy said, breaking into a  run to her father\u2019s side.\n\n15\n\n \u201cEverything\u2019s all set, Peg,\u201d her father said with a  grin. \u201cAnd it\u2019s set just the way you wanted it! There\u2019s  not a man in the world who can hold out against  two determined women.\u201d He leaned back against the  fireplace mantel, waiting for the explosion he felt  sure was to follow his announcement. But Peggy just  stood, hardly moving a muscle. Then she walked  carefully, as if she were on the deck of a rolling ship,  to the big easy chair and slowly sat down.\n\n\n \u201cWell, for goodness\u2019 sake!\u201d her mother cried.  \u201cWhere\u2019s the enthusiasm?\u201d\n\n\n Peggy swallowed hard before answering. When  her voice came, it sounded strange, about two tones  higher than usual. \u201cI ... I\u2019m trying to be sedate ... and  poised ... and very grown-up,\u201d she said.  \u201cBut it\u2019s not easy. All I want to do is to\u2014\u201d and she  jumped out of the chair\u2014\u201cto yell whoopee !\u201d She  yelled at the top of her lungs.\n\n\n After the kisses, the hugs, and the first excitement,  Peggy and her parents adjourned to the kitchen, the  favorite household conference room, for cookies and  milk and more talk.\n\n\n \u201cNow, tell me, Dad,\u201d Peggy asked, her mouth full  of oatmeal cookies, no longer \u201csedate\u201d or \u201cpoised,\u201d  but her natural, bubbling self. \u201cWho was that on the  phone, and where are the three of us going, and  what\u2019s all set?\u201d\n\n16\n\n \u201cOne thing at a time,\u201d her father said. \u201cTo begin  with, we decided almost as soon as you left that we  were going to let you go to New York to try a year\u2019s  experience in the theater. But then we had to decide  just where you would live, and where you should  study, and how much money you would need, and a  whole lot of other things. So I called New York to talk  to an old friend of mine who I felt would be able to  give us some help. Her name is May Berriman, and  she\u2019s spent all her life in the theater. In fact, she was  a very successful actress. Now she\u2019s been retired for  some years, but I thought she might give us some  good advice.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cAnd did she?\u201d Peggy asked.\n\n\n \u201cWe were luckier than I would have thought possible,\u201d  Mrs. Lane put in. \u201cIt seems that May bought a  big, old-fashioned town house and converted it into  a rooming house especially for young actresses. She  always wanted a house of her own with a garden in  back, but felt it was foolish for a woman living alone.  This way, she can afford to run a big place and at  the same time not be alone. And best of all, she says  she has a room that you can have!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, Mother! It sounds wonderful!\u201d Peggy exulted.  \u201cI\u2019ll be with other girls my own age who are actresses,  and living with an experienced actress! I\u2019ll bet she  can teach me loads!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m sure she can,\u201d her father said. \u201cAnd so can  the New York Dramatic Academy.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cDad!\u201d Peggy shouted, almost choking on a cooky.  \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve managed to get me accepted  there! That\u2019s the best dramatic school in the country!  How\u2014?\u201d\n\n17\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t get too excited, Peg,\u201d Mr. Lane interrupted.  \u201cYou\u2019re not accepted anywhere yet, but May  Berriman told me that the Academy is the best place  to study acting, and she said she would set up an  audition for you in two days. The term starts in a  couple of weeks, so there isn\u2019t much time to lose.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTwo days! Do you mean we\u2019ll be going to New  York day after tomorrow, just like that?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, no,\u201d her mother answered calmly. \u201cWe\u2019re going  to New York tomorrow on the first plane that we  can get seats on. Your father doesn\u2019t believe in wasting  time, once his mind is made up.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTomorrow?\u201d Peggy repeated, almost unable to believe  what she had heard. \u201cWhat are we sitting here  talking for, then? I\u2019ve got a million things to do! I\u2019ve  got to get packed ... I\u2019ve got to think of what to  read for the audition! I can study on the plane, I  guess, but ... oh! I\u2019ll be terrible in a reading unless  I can have more time! Oh, Mother, what parts  will I do? Where\u2019s the Shakespeare? Where\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhoa!\u201d Mr. Lane said, catching Peggy\u2019s arm to  prevent her from rushing out of the kitchen. \u201cNot  now, young lady! We\u2019ll pack in the morning, talk  about what you should read, and take an afternoon  plane to New York. But tonight, you\u2019d better think  of nothing more than getting to bed. This is going to  be a busy time for all of us.\u201d\n\n\n Reluctantly, Peggy agreed, recognizing the sense  of what her father said. She finished her milk and  cookies, kissed her parents good night and went upstairs  to bed.\n\n\n But it was one thing to go to bed and another to  go to sleep.\n\n18\n\n Peggy lay on her back, staring at the ceiling and  the patterns of light and shade cast by the street  lamp outside as it shone through the leaves of the big  maple tree. As she watched the shifting shadows,  she reviewed the roles she had played since her first  time in a high-school play. Which should she refresh  herself on? Which ones would she do best? And  which ones were most suited to her now? She recognized  that she had grown and developed past some  of the roles which had once seemed perfectly suited  to her talent and her appearance. But both had  changed. She was certainly not a mature actress  yet, from any point of view, but neither was she a  schoolgirl. Her trim figure was well formed; her face  had lost the undefined, simple cuteness of the early  teens, and had gained character. She didn\u2019t think she  should read a young romantic part like Juliet. Not  that she couldn\u2019t do it, but perhaps something  sharper was called for.\n\n\n Perhaps Viola in Twelfth Night ? Or perhaps not  Shakespeare at all. Maybe the people at the Academy  would think she was too arty or too pretentious?  Maybe she should do something dramatic and full of  stormy emotion, like Blanche in A Streetcar Named  Desire ? Or, better for her development and age, a  light, brittle, comedy role...?\n\n19\n\n Nothing seemed quite right. Peggy\u2019s thoughts  shifted with the shadows overhead. All the plays she  had ever seen or read or acted in melted together in  a blur, until the characters from one seemed to be  talking with the characters from another and moving  about in an enormous set made of pieces from two or  three different plays. More actors kept coming on in  a fantastic assortment of costumes until the stage was  full. Then the stage lights dimmed, the actors joined  hands across the stage to bow, the curtain slowly  descended, the lights went out\u2014and Peggy was fast  asleep. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich of these sets of descriptions best describes Peggy?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She's talented, unwise, and creative\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She's dedicated, bold, and pretty\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She's dedicated, bold, and pretty\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She's dedicated, bold, and pretty\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
