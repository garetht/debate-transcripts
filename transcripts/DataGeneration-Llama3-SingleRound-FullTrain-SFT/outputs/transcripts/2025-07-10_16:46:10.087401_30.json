      "background_text": "THE PERFECTIONISTS By ARNOLD CASTLE ILLUSTRATED by SUMMERS Is there something wrong with you?  Do you fail to fit in with your group?  Nervous, anxious, ill-at-ease? Happy  about it? Lucky you! Frank Pembroke  sat behind  the desk of his shabby  little office over Lemark's Liquors  in downtown Los Angeles and  waited for his first customer. He  had been in business for a week  and as yet had had no callers.  Therefore, it was with a mingled  sense of excitement and satisfaction  that he greeted the tall,  dark, smooth-faced figure that  came up the stairs and into the  office shortly before noon.\n\n\n \"Good day, sir,\" said Pembroke  with an amiable smile. \"I  see my advertisement has interested  you. Please stand in that  corner for just a moment.\"\n\n\n Opening the desk drawer,  which was almost empty, Pembroke  removed an automatic pistol  fitted with a silencer. Pointing  it at the amazed customer, he  fired four .22 caliber longs into  the narrow chest. Then he made  a telephone call and sat down to  wait. He wondered how long it  would be before his next client  would arrive. The series of events leading up  to Pembroke's present occupation  had commenced on a dismal,  overcast evening in the South  Pacific a year earlier. Bound for  Sydney, two days out of Valparaiso,  the Colombian tramp  steamer Elena Mia had encountered  a dense greenish fog which  seemed vaguely redolent of citrus  trees. Standing on the forward  deck, Pembroke was one of the  first to perceive the peculiar odor  and to spot the immense gray  hulk wallowing in the murky distance.\n\n\n Then the explosion had come,  from far below the waterline,  and the decks were awash with  frantic crewmen, officers, and the  handful of passengers. Only two  lifeboats were launched before  the Elena Mia went down. Pembroke  was in the second. The  roar of the sinking ship was the  last thing he heard for some  time.\n\n\n Pembroke came as close to being  a professional adventurer as  one can in these days of regimented  travel, organized peril,  and political restriction. He had  made for himself a substantial  fortune through speculation in a  great variety of properties, real  and otherwise. Life had given  him much and demanded little,  which was perhaps the reason  for his restiveness. Loyalty to person or to people  was a trait Pembroke had never  recognized in himself, nor had it  ever been expected of him. And  yet he greatly envied those  staunch patriots and lovers who  could find it in themselves to  elevate the glory and safety of  others above that of themselves.\n\n\n Lacking such loyalties, Pembroke  adapted quickly to the situation  in which he found himself  when he regained consciousness.  He awoke in a small room in  what appeared to be a typical  modern American hotel. The wallet  in his pocket contained exactly  what it should, approximately  three hundred dollars.  His next thought was of food.  He left the room and descended  via the elevator to the restaurant.  Here he observed that it  was early afternoon. Ordering  a full dinner, for he was unusually  hungry, he began to study the  others in the restaurant.\n\n\n Many of the faces seemed familiar;  the crew of the ship,  probably. He also recognized several  of the passengers. However,  he made no attempt to speak to  them. After his meal, he bought  a good corona and went for a  walk. His situation could have  been any small western American  seacoast city. He heard the hiss  of the ocean in the direction the  afternoon sun was taking. In his  full-gaited walk, he was soon approaching  the beach.\n\n\n On the sand he saw a number  of sun bathers. One in particular,  an attractive woman of about  thirty, tossed back her long,  chestnut locks and gazed up intently  at Pembroke as he passed.  Seldom had he enjoyed so ingenuous  an invitation. He halted  and stared down at her for a few  moments.\n\n\n \"You are looking for someone?\"  she inquired.\n\n\n \"Much of the time,\" said the  man.\n\n\n \"Could it be me?\"\n\n\n \"It could be.\"\n\n\n \"Yet you seem unsure,\" she  said.\n\n\n Pembroke smiled, uneasily.  There was something not entirely  normal about her conversation.  Though the rest of her compensated  for that.\n\n\n \"Tell me what's wrong with  me,\" she went on urgently. \"I'm  not good enough, am I? I mean,  there's something wrong with  the way I look or act. Isn't there?  Please help me, please!\"\n\n\n \"You're not casual enough, for  one thing,\" said Pembroke, deciding  to play along with her for  the moment. \"You're too tense.  Also you're a bit knock-kneed,  not that it matters. Is that what  you wanted to hear?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes\u2014I mean, I suppose  so. I can try to be more casual.  But I don't know what to do  about my knees,\" she said wistfully,  staring across at the  smooth, tan limbs. \"Do you think  I'm okay otherwise? I mean, as a  whole I'm not so bad, am I? Oh,  please tell me.\"\n\n\n \"How about talking it over at  supper tonight?\" Pembroke proposed.  \"Maybe with less distraction  I'll have a better picture of  you\u2014as a whole.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very generous of  you,\" the woman told him. She  scribbled a name and an address  on a small piece of paper and  handed it to him. \"Any time  after six,\" she said.\n\n\n Pembroke left the beach and  walked through several small  specialty shops. He tried to get  the woman off his mind, but the  oddness of her conversation continued  to bother him. She was  right about being different, but  it was her concern about being  different that made her so. How  to explain that to her? Then he saw the weird little  glass statuette among the usual  bric-a-brac. It rather resembled  a ground hog, had seven fingers  on each of its six limbs, and  smiled up at him as he stared.\n\n\n \"Can I help you, sir?\" a middle-aged  saleswoman inquired.  \"Oh, good heavens, whatever is  that thing doing here?\"\n\n\n Pembroke watched with lifted  eyebrows as the clerk whisked  the bizarre statuette underneath  the counter.\n\n\n \"What the hell was that?\"  Pembroke demanded.\n\n\n \"Oh, you know\u2014or don't you?  Oh, my,\" she concluded, \"are you  one of the\u2014strangers?\"\n\n\n \"And if I were?\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'd certainly appreciate  it if you'd tell me how I walk.\" She came around in front of  the counter and strutted back  and forth a few times.\n\n\n \"They tell me I lean too far  forward,\" she confided. \"But I  should think you'd fall down if  you didn't.\"\n\n\n \"Don't try to go so fast and  you won't fall down,\" suggested  Pembroke. \"You're in too much  of a hurry. Also those fake flowers  on your blouse make you look  frumpy.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'm supposed to look  frumpy,\" the woman retorted.  \"That's the type of person I am.  But you can look frumpy and still  walk natural, can't you? Everyone  says you can.\"\n\n\n \"Well, they've got a point,\"  said Pembroke. \"Incidentally,  just where are we, anyway?  What city is this?\"\n\n\n \"Puerto Pacifico,\" she told  him. \"Isn't that a lovely name?  It means peaceful port. In Spanish.\"\n\n\n That was fine. At least he now  knew where he was. But as he  left the shop he began checking  off every west coast state, city,  town, and inlet. None, to the best  of his knowledge, was called  Puerto Pacifico.\n\n\n He headed for the nearest  service station and asked for a  map. The attendant gave him one  which showed the city, but nothing  beyond.\n\n\n \"Which way is it to San Francisco?\"  asked Pembroke.\n\n\n \"That all depends on where  you are,\" the boy returned.\n\n\n \"Okay, then where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, there's a customer,\"  the boy said. \"This is  Puerto Pacifico.\"\n\n\n Pembroke watched him hurry  off to service a car with a sense  of having been given the runaround.  To his surprise, the boy  came back a few minutes later  after servicing the automobile.\n\n\n \"Say, I've just figured out who  you are,\" the youngster told him.  \"I'd sure appreciate it if you'd  give me a little help on my lingo.  Also, you gas up the car first,  then try to sell 'em the oil\u2014right?\"\n\n\n \"Right,\" said Pembroke wearily.  \"What's wrong with your  lingo? Other than the fact that  it's not colloquial enough.\"\n\n\n \"Not enough slang, huh? Well,  I guess I'll have to concentrate  on that. How about the smile?\"\n\n\n \"Perfect,\" Pembroke told him.\n\n\n \"Yeah?\" said the boy delightedly.  \"Say, come back again,  huh? I sure appreciate the help.  Keep the map.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks. One more thing,\"  Pembroke said. \"What's over  that way\u2014outside the city?\"\n\n\n \"Sand.\"\n\n\n \"How about that way?\" he  asked, pointing north. \"And that  way?\" pointing south.\n\n\n \"More of the same.\"\n\n\n \"Any railroads?\"\n\n\n \"That we ain't got.\"\n\n\n \"Buses? Airlines?\"\n\n\n The kid shook his head.\n\n\n \"Some city.\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, it's kinda isolated. A  lot of ships dock here, though.\"\n\n\n \"All cargo ships, I'll bet. No  passengers,\" said Pembroke.\n\n\n \"Right,\" said the attendant,  giving with his perfect smile.\n\n\n \"No getting out of here, is  there?\"\n\n\n \"That's for sure,\" the boy said,  walking away to wait on another  customer. \"If you don't like the  place, you've had it.\" Pembroke returned to the  hotel. Going to the bar, he recognized  one of the Elena Mia's paying  passengers. He was a short,  rectangular little man in his fifties  named Spencer. He sat in a  booth with three young women,  all lovely, all effusive. The topic  of the conversation turned out  to be precisely what Pembroke  had predicted.\n\n\n \"Well, Louisa, I'd say your  only fault is the way you keep  wigglin' your shoulders up 'n'  down. Why'n'sha try holdin' 'em  straight?\"\n\n\n \"I thought it made me look  sexy,\" the redhead said petulantly.\n\n\n \"Just be yourself, gal,\" Spencer  drawled, jabbing her intimately  with a fat elbow, \"and  you'll qualify.\"\n\n\n \"Me, me,\" the blonde with a  feather cut was insisting. \"What  is wrong with me?\"\n\n\n \"You're perfect, sweetheart,\"  he told her, taking her hand.\n\n\n \"Ah, come on,\" she pleaded.  \"Everyone tells me I chew gum  with my mouth open. Don't you  hate that?\"\n\n\n \"Naw, that's part of your  charm,\" Spencer assured her.\n\n\n \"How 'bout me, sugar,\" asked  the girl with the coal black hair.\n\n\n \"Ah, you're perfect, too. You  are all perfect. I've never seen  such a collection of dolls as parade  around this here city.  C'mon, kids\u2014how 'bout another  round?\"\n\n\n But the dolls had apparently  lost interest in him. They got up  one by one and walked out of the  bar. Pembroke took his rum and  tonic and moved over to Spencer's  booth.\n\n\n \"Okay if I join you?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said the fat man.  \"Wonder what the hell got into  those babes?\"\n\n\n \"You said they were perfect.  They know they're not. You've  got to be rough with them in this  town,\" said Pembroke. \"That's  all they want from us.\"\n\n\n \"Mister, you've been doing  some thinkin', I can see,\" said  Spencer, peering at him suspiciously.  \"Maybe you've figured  out where we are.\"\n\n\n \"Your bet's as good as mine,\"  said Pembroke. \"It's not Wellington,  and it's not Brisbane, and  it's not Long Beach, and it's not  Tahiti. There are a lot of places  it's not. But where the hell it is,  you tell me.\n\n\n \"And, by the way,\" he added,  \"I hope you like it in Puerto  Pacifico. Because there isn't any  place to go from here and there  isn't any way to get there if  there were.\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, gentlemen, but  I'm Joe Valencia, manager of the  hotel. I would be very grateful if  you would give me a few minutes  of honest criticism.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, no, not you, too,\" groaned  Spencer. \"Look, Joe, what's  the gag?\"\n\n\n \"You are newcomers, Mr.  Spencer,\" Valencia explained.  \"You are therefore in an excellent  position to point out our  faults as you see them.\"\n\n\n \"Well, so what?\" demanded  Spencer. \"I've got more important  things to do than to worry  about your troubles. You look  okay to me.\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Valencia,\" said Pembroke.  \"I've noticed that you  walk with a very slight limp. If  you have a bad leg, I should  think you would do better to develop  a more pronounced limp.  Otherwise, you may appear to  be self-conscious about it.\" Spencer opened his mouth to  protest, but saw with amazement  that it was exactly this that  Valencia was seeking. Pembroke  was amused at his companion's  reaction but observed that Spencer  still failed to see the point.\n\n\n \"Also, there is a certain effeminateness  in the way in which  you speak,\" said Pembroke. \"Try  to be a little more direct, a little  more brusque. Speak in a monotone.  It will make you more acceptable.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you so much,\" said the  manager. \"There is much food  for thought in what you have  said, Mr. Pembroke. However,  Mr. Spencer, your value has failed  to prove itself. You have only  yourself to blame. Cooperation is  all we require of you.\"\n\n\n Valencia left. Spencer ordered  another martini. Neither he nor  Pembroke spoke for several minutes.\n\n\n \"Somebody's crazy around  here,\" the fat man muttered  after a few moments. \"Is it me,  Frank?\"\n\n\n \"No. You just don't belong  here, in this particular place,\"  said Pembroke thoughtfully.  \"You're the wrong type. But they  couldn't know that ahead of time.  The way they operate it's a  pretty hit-or-miss operation. But  they don't care one bit about us,  Spencer. Consider the men who  went down with the ship. That  was just part of the game.\"\n\n\n \"What the hell are you sayin'?\"  asked Spencer in disbelief.  \"You figure they sunk the ship?  Valencia and the waitress and  the three babes? Ah, come on.\"\n\n\n \"It's what you think that will  determine what you do, Spencer.  I suggest you change your attitude;  play along with them for a  few days till the picture becomes  a little clearer to you. We'll talk  about it again then.\"\n\n\n Pembroke rose and started out  of the bar. A policeman entered  and walked directly to Spencer's  table. Loitering at the juke box,  Pembroke overheard the conversation.\n\n\n \"You Spencer?\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said the fat  man sullenly.\n\n\n \"What don't you like about  me? The truth , buddy.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, hell! Nothin' wrong  with you at all, and nothin'll  make me say there is,\" said Spencer.\n\n\n \"You're the guy, all right. Too  bad, Mac,\" said the cop.\n\n\n Pembroke heard the shots as  he strolled casually out into the  brightness of the hotel lobby.  While he waited for the elevator,  he saw them carrying the body  into the street. How many others,  he wondered, had gone out on  their backs during their first day  in Puerto Pacifico? Pembroke shaved, showered,  and put on the new suit and shirt  he had bought. Then he took  Mary Ann, the woman he had  met on the beach, out to dinner.  She would look magnificent even  when fully clothed, he decided,  and the pale chartreuse gown she  wore hardly placed her in that  category. Her conversation seemed  considerably more normal  after the other denizens of  Puerto Pacifico Pembroke had  listened to that afternoon.\n\n\n After eating they danced for  an hour, had a few more drinks,  then went to Pembroke's room.  He still knew nothing about her  and had almost exhausted his  critical capabilities, but not once  had she become annoyed with  him. She seemed to devour every  factual point of imperfection  about herself that Pembroke  brought to her attention. And,  fantastically enough, she actually  appeared to have overcome every  little imperfection he had been  able to communicate to her.\n\n\n It was in the privacy of his  room that Pembroke became  aware of just how perfect, physically,  Mary Ann was. Too perfect.  No freckles or moles anywhere  on the visible surface of  her brown skin, which was more  than a mere sampling. Furthermore,  her face and body were  meticulously symmetrical. And  she seemed to be wholly ambidextrous.\n\n\n \"With so many beautiful  women in Puerto Pacifico,\" said  Pembroke probingly, \"I find it  hard to understand why there are  so few children.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, children are decorative,  aren't they,\" said Mary Ann. \"I  do wish there were more of  them.\"\n\n\n \"Why not have a couple of  your own?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Oh, they're only given to maternal  types. I'd never get one.  Anyway, I won't ever marry,\"  she said. \"I'm the paramour  type.\"\n\n\n It was obvious that the liquor  had been having some effect.  Either that, or she had a basic  flaw of loquacity that no one else  had discovered. Pembroke decided  he would have to cover his  tracks carefully.\n\n\n \"What type am I?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Silly, you're real. You're not  a type at all.\"\n\n\n \"Mary Ann, I love you very  much,\" Pembroke murmured,  gambling everything on this one  throw. \"When you go to Earth  I'll miss you terribly.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, but you'll be dead by  then,\" she pouted. \"So I mustn't  fall in love with you. I don't want  to be miserable.\"\n\n\n \"If I pretended I was one of  you, if I left on the boat with  you, they'd let me go to Earth  with you. Wouldn't they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes, I'm sure they would.\"\n\n\n \"Mary Ann, you have two  other flaws I feel I should mention.\"\n\n\n \"Yes? Please tell me.\"\n\n\n \"In the first place,\" said Pembroke,  \"you should be willing to  fall in love with me even if it  will eventually make you unhappy.  How can you be the paramour  type if you refuse to fall in  love foolishly? And when you  have fallen in love, you should be  very loyal.\"\n\n\n \"I'll try,\" she said unsurely.  \"What else?\"\n\n\n \"The other thing is that, as  my mistress, you must never  mention me to anyone. It would  place me in great danger.\"\n\n\n \"I'll never tell anyone anything  about you,\" she promised.\n\n\n \"Now try to love me,\" Pembroke  said, drawing her into his  arms and kissing with little  pleasure the smooth, warm perfection  of her tanned cheeks.  \"Love me my sweet, beautiful,  affectionate Mary Ann. My paramour.\"\n\n\n Making love to Mary Ann was  something short of ecstasy. Not  for any obvious reason, but because  of subtle little factors that  make a woman a woman. Mary  Ann had no pulse. Mary Ann did  not perspire. Mary Ann did not  fatigue gradually but all at once.  Mary Ann breathed regularly  under all circumstances. Mary  Ann talked and talked and talked.  But then, Mary Ann was not  a human being.\n\n\n When she left the hotel at midnight,  Pembroke was quite sure  that she understood his plan and  that she was irrevocably in love  with him. Tomorrow might bring  his death, but it might also ensure  his escape. After forty-two  years of searching for a passion,  for a cause, for a loyalty, Frank  Pembroke had at last found his.  Earth and the human race that  peopled it. And Mary Ann would  help him to save it. The next morning Pembroke  talked to Valencia about hunting.  He said that he planned to go  shooting out on the desert which  surrounded the city. Valencia  told him that there were no living  creatures anywhere but in  the city. Pembroke said he was  going out anyway.\n\n\n He picked up Mary Ann at her  apartment and together they  went to a sporting goods store.  As he guessed there was a goodly  selection of firearms, despite the  fact that there was nothing to  hunt and only a single target  range within the city. Everything,  of course, had to be just  like Earth. That, after all, was  the purpose of Puerto Pacifico.\n\n\n By noon they had rented a  jeep and were well away from  the city. Pembroke and Mary  Ann took turns firing at the paper  targets they had purchased. At  twilight they headed back to the  city. On the outskirts, where the  sand and soil were mixed and no  footprints would be left, Pembroke  hopped off. Mary Ann  would go straight to the police  and report that Pembroke had attacked  her and that she had shot  him. If necessary, she would conduct  the authorities to the place  where they had been target  shooting, but would be unable to  locate the spot where she had  buried the body. Why had she  buried it? Because at first she  was not going to report the incident.  She was frightened. It  was not airtight, but there would  probably be no further investigation.  And they certainly would  not prosecute Mary Ann for killing  an Earthman.\n\n\n Now Pembroke had himself to  worry about. The first step was  to enter smoothly into the new  life he had planned. It wouldn't  be so comfortable as the previous  one, but should be considerably  safer. He headed slowly for the  \"old\" part of town, aging his  clothes against buildings and  fences as he walked. He had already  torn the collar of the shirt  and discarded his belt. By morning  his beard would grow to  blacken his face. And he would  look weary and hungry and aimless.  Only the last would be a deception. Two weeks later Pembroke  phoned Mary Ann. The police  had accepted her story without  even checking. And when, when  would she be seeing him again?  He had aroused her passion and  no amount of long-distance love  could requite it. Soon, he assured  her, soon.\n\n\n \"Because, after all, you do owe  me something,\" she added.\n\n\n And that was bad because it  sounded as if she had been giving  some womanly thought to the situation.  A little more of that and  she might go to the police again,  this time for vengeance.\n\n\n Twice during his wanderings  Pembroke had seen the corpses  of Earthmen being carted out of  buildings. They had to be Earthmen  because they bled. Mary Ann  had admitted that she did not.  There would be very few Earthmen  left in Puerto Pacifico, and  it would be simple enough to locate  him if he were reported as  being on the loose. There was  no out but to do away with Mary  Ann.\n\n\n Pembroke headed for the  beach. He knew she invariably  went there in the afternoon. He  loitered around the stalls where  hot dogs and soft drinks were  sold, leaning against a post in  the hot sun, hat pulled down over  his forehead. Then he noticed  that people all about him were  talking excitedly. They were discussing  a ship. It was leaving  that afternoon. Anyone who  could pass the interview would  be sent to Earth.\n\n\n Pembroke had visited the  docks every day, without being  able to learn when the great  exodus would take place. Yet he  was certain the first lap would be  by water rather than by spaceship,  since no one he had talked  to in the city had ever heard of  spaceships. In fact, they knew  very little about their masters.\n\n\n Now the ship had arrived and  was to leave shortly. If there was  any but the most superficial examination,  Pembroke would no  doubt be discovered and exterminated.  But since no one seemed  concerned about anything but his  own speech and behavior, he assumed  that they had all qualified  in every other respect. The reason  for transporting Earth People  to this planet was, of course,  to apply a corrective to any of  the Pacificos' aberrant mannerisms  or articulation. This was  the polishing up phase. Pembroke began hobbling toward  the docks. Almost at once  he found himself face to face  with Mary Ann. She smiled happily  when she recognized him. That was a good thing.\n\n\n \"It is a sign of poor breeding  to smile at tramps,\" Pembroke  admonished her in a whisper.  \"Walk on ahead.\"\n\n\n She obeyed. He followed. The  crowd grew thicker. They neared  the docks and Pembroke saw that  there were now set up on the  roped-off wharves small interviewing  booths. When it was  their turn, he and Mary Ann  each went into separate ones.  Pembroke found himself alone in  the little room.\n\n\n Then he saw that there was  another entity in his presence  confined beneath a glass dome. It  looked rather like a groundhog  and had seven fingers on each of  its six limbs. But it was larger  and hairier than the glass one  he had seen at the gift store.  With four of its limbs it tapped  on an intricate keyboard in front  of it.\n\n\n \"What is your name?\" queried  a metallic voice from a speaker  on the wall.\n\n\n \"I'm Jerry Newton. Got no  middle initial,\" Pembroke said in  a surly voice.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"I work a lot o' trades. Fisherman,  fruit picker, fightin' range  fires, vineyards, car washer. Anything.  You name it. Been out of  work for a long time now,  though. Goin' on five months.  These here are hard times, no  matter what they say.\"\n\n\n \"What do you think of the  Chinese situation?\" the voice inquired.\n\n\n \"Which situation's 'at?\"\n\n\n \"Where's Seattle?\"\n\n\n \"Seattle? State o' Washington.\"\n\n\n And so it went for about five  minutes. Then he was told he  had qualified as a satisfactory  surrogate for a mid-twentieth  century American male, itinerant  type.\n\n\n \"You understand your mission,  Newton?\" the voice asked. \"You  are to establish yourself on  Earth. In time you will receive  instructions. Then you will attack.  You will not see us, your  masters, again until the atmosphere  has been sufficiently chlorinated.  In the meantime, serve  us well.\"\n\n\n He stumbled out toward the  docks, then looked about for  Mary Ann. He saw her at last  behind the ropes, her lovely face  in tears.\n\n\n Then she saw him. Waving  frantically, she called his name  several times. Pembroke mingled  with the crowd moving toward  the ship, ignoring her. But still  the woman persisted in her  shouting.\n\n\n Sidling up to a well-dressed  man-about-town type, Pembroke  winked at him and snickered.\n\n\n \"You Frank?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Hell, no. But some poor  punk's sure red in the face, I'll  bet,\" the man-about-town said  with a chuckle. \"Those high-strung  paramour types always  raising a ruckus. They never do  pass the interview. Don't know  why they even make 'em.\"\n\n\n Suddenly Mary Ann was quiet.\n\n\n \"Ambulance squad,\" Pembroke's  companion explained.  \"They'll take her off to the buggy  house for a few days and bring  her out fresh and ignorant as the  day she was assembled. Don't  know why they keep making 'em,  as I say. But I guess there's a  call for that type up there on  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, I reckon there is at  that,\" said Pembroke, snickering  again as he moved away from the  other. \"And why not? Hey?  Why not?\"\n\n\n Pembroke went right on hating  himself, however, till the  night he was deposited in a field  outside of Ensenada, broke but  happy, with two other itinerant  types. They separated in San  Diego, and it was not long before  Pembroke was explaining to the  police how he had drifted far  from the scene of the sinking of  the Elena Mia on a piece of  wreckage, and had been picked  up by a Chilean trawler. How he  had then made his way, with  much suffering, up the coast to  California. Two days later, his  identity established and his circumstances  again solvent, he was  headed for Los Angeles to begin  his save-Earth campaign. Now, seated at his battered  desk in the shabby rented office  over Lemark's Liquors, Pembroke  gazed without emotion at  the two demolished Pacificos that  lay sprawled one atop the other  in the corner. His watch said  one-fifteen. The man from the  FBI should arrive soon.\n\n\n There were footsteps on the  stairs for the third time that  day. Not the brisk, efficient steps  of a federal official, but the hesitant,  self-conscious steps of a  junior clerk type.\n\n\n Pembroke rose as the young  man appeared at the door. His  face was smooth, unpimpled,  clean-shaven, without sweat on a  warm summer afternoon.\n\n\n \"Are you Dr. Von Schubert?\"  the newcomer asked, peering into  the room. \"You see, I've got a  problem\u2014\"\n\n\n The four shots from Pembroke's  pistol solved his problem  effectively. Pembroke tossed his  third victim onto the pile, then  opened a can of lager, quaffing  it appreciatively. Seating himself  once more, he leaned back in  the chair, both feet upon the  desk.\n\n\n He would be out of business  soon, once the FBI agent had got  there. Pembroke was only in it to  get the proof he would need to  convince people of the truth of  his tale. But in the meantime he  allowed himself to admire the  clipping of the newspaper ad he  had run in all the Los Angeles  papers for the past week.

Do you fail to fit in with your group?  Nervous, anxious, ill-at-ease? Happy  about it? Lucky you! Frank Pembroke  sat behind  the desk of his shabby  little office over Lemark's Liquors  in downtown Los Angeles and  waited for his first customer. He  had been in business for a week  and as yet had had no callers.  Therefore, it was with a mingled  sense of excitement and satisfaction  that he greeted the tall,  dark, smooth-faced figure that  came up the stairs and into the  office shortly before noon.\n\n\n \"Good day, sir,\" said Pembroke  with an amiable smile. \"I  see my advertisement has interested  you. Please stand in that  corner for just a moment.\"\n\n\n Opening the desk drawer,  which was almost empty, Pembroke  removed an automatic pistol  fitted with a silencer. Pointing  it at the amazed customer, he  fired four .22 caliber longs into  the narrow chest. Then he made  a telephone call and sat down to  wait. He wondered how long it  would be before his next client  would arrive. The series of events leading up  to Pembroke's present occupation  had commenced on a dismal,  overcast evening in the South  Pacific a year earlier. Bound for  Sydney, two days out of Valparaiso,  the Colombian tramp  steamer Elena Mia had encountered  a dense greenish fog which  seemed vaguely redolent of citrus  trees. Standing on the forward  deck, Pembroke was one of the  first to perceive the peculiar odor  and to spot the immense gray  hulk wallowing in the murky distance.\n\n\n Then the explosion had come,  from far below the waterline,  and the decks were awash with  frantic crewmen, officers, and the  handful of passengers. Only two  lifeboats were launched before  the Elena Mia went down. Pembroke  was in the second. The  roar of the sinking ship was the  last thing he heard for some  time.\n\n\n Pembroke came as close to being  a professional adventurer as  one can in these days of regimented  travel, organized peril,  and political restriction. He had  made for himself a substantial  fortune through speculation in a  great variety of properties, real  and otherwise. Life had given  him much and demanded little,  which was perhaps the reason  for his restiveness. Loyalty to person or to people  was a trait Pembroke had never  recognized in himself, nor had it  ever been expected of him. And  yet he greatly envied those  staunch patriots and lovers who  could find it in themselves to  elevate the glory and safety of  others above that of themselves.\n\n\n Lacking such loyalties, Pembroke  adapted quickly to the situation  in which he found himself  when he regained consciousness.  He awoke in a small room in  what appeared to be a typical  modern American hotel. The wallet  in his pocket contained exactly  what it should, approximately  three hundred dollars.  His next thought was of food.  He left the room and descended  via the elevator to the restaurant.  Here he observed that it  was early afternoon. Ordering  a full dinner, for he was unusually  hungry, he began to study the  others in the restaurant.\n\n\n Many of the faces seemed familiar;  the crew of the ship,  probably. He also recognized several  of the passengers. However,  he made no attempt to speak to  them. After his meal, he bought  a good corona and went for a  walk. His situation could have  been any small western American  seacoast city. He heard the hiss  of the ocean in the direction the  afternoon sun was taking. In his  full-gaited walk, he was soon approaching  the beach.\n\n\n On the sand he saw a number  of sun bathers. One in particular,  an attractive woman of about  thirty, tossed back her long,  chestnut locks and gazed up intently  at Pembroke as he passed.  Seldom had he enjoyed so ingenuous  an invitation. He halted  and stared down at her for a few  moments.\n\n\n \"You are looking for someone?\"  she inquired.\n\n\n \"Much of the time,\" said the  man.\n\n\n \"Could it be me?\"\n\n\n \"It could be.\"\n\n\n \"Yet you seem unsure,\" she  said.\n\n\n Pembroke smiled, uneasily.  There was something not entirely  normal about her conversation.  Though the rest of her compensated  for that.\n\n\n \"Tell me what's wrong with  me,\" she went on urgently. \"I'm  not good enough, am I? I mean,  there's something wrong with  the way I look or act. Isn't there?  Please help me, please!\"\n\n\n \"You're not casual enough, for  one thing,\" said Pembroke, deciding  to play along with her for  the moment. \"You're too tense.  Also you're a bit knock-kneed,  not that it matters. Is that what  you wanted to hear?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes\u2014I mean, I suppose  so. I can try to be more casual.  But I don't know what to do  about my knees,\" she said wistfully,  staring across at the  smooth, tan limbs. \"Do you think  I'm okay otherwise? I mean, as a  whole I'm not so bad, am I? Oh,  please tell me.\"\n\n\n \"How about talking it over at  supper tonight?\" Pembroke proposed.  \"Maybe with less distraction  I'll have a better picture of  you\u2014as a whole.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very generous of  you,\" the woman told him. She  scribbled a name and an address  on a small piece of paper and  handed it to him. \"Any time  after six,\" she said.\n\n\n Pembroke left the beach and  walked through several small  specialty shops. He tried to get  the woman off his mind, but the  oddness of her conversation continued  to bother him. She was  right about being different, but  it was her concern about being  different that made her so. How  to explain that to her? Then he saw the weird little  glass statuette among the usual  bric-a-brac. It rather resembled  a ground hog, had seven fingers  on each of its six limbs, and  smiled up at him as he stared.\n\n\n \"Can I help you, sir?\" a middle-aged  saleswoman inquired.  \"Oh, good heavens, whatever is  that thing doing here?\"\n\n\n Pembroke watched with lifted  eyebrows as the clerk whisked  the bizarre statuette underneath  the counter.\n\n\n \"What the hell was that?\"  Pembroke demanded.\n\n\n \"Oh, you know\u2014or don't you?  Oh, my,\" she concluded, \"are you  one of the\u2014strangers?\"\n\n\n \"And if I were?\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'd certainly appreciate  it if you'd tell me how I walk.\" She came around in front of  the counter and strutted back  and forth a few times.\n\n\n \"They tell me I lean too far  forward,\" she confided. \"But I  should think you'd fall down if  you didn't.\"\n\n\n \"Don't try to go so fast and  you won't fall down,\" suggested  Pembroke. \"You're in too much  of a hurry. Also those fake flowers  on your blouse make you look  frumpy.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'm supposed to look  frumpy,\" the woman retorted.  \"That's the type of person I am.  But you can look frumpy and still  walk natural, can't you? Everyone  says you can.\"\n\n\n \"Well, they've got a point,\"  said Pembroke. \"Incidentally,  just where are we, anyway?  What city is this?\"\n\n\n \"Puerto Pacifico,\" she told  him. \"Isn't that a lovely name?  It means peaceful port. In Spanish.\"\n\n\n That was fine. At least he now  knew where he was. But as he  left the shop he began checking  off every west coast state, city,  town, and inlet. None, to the best  of his knowledge, was called  Puerto Pacifico.\n\n\n He headed for the nearest  service station and asked for a  map. The attendant gave him one  which showed the city, but nothing  beyond.\n\n\n \"Which way is it to San Francisco?\"  asked Pembroke.\n\n\n \"That all depends on where  you are,\" the boy returned.\n\n\n \"Okay, then where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, there's a customer,\"  the boy said. \"This is  Puerto Pacifico.\"\n\n\n Pembroke watched him hurry  off to service a car with a sense  of having been given the runaround.  To his surprise, the boy  came back a few minutes later  after servicing the automobile.\n\n\n \"Say, I've just figured out who  you are,\" the youngster told him.  \"I'd sure appreciate it if you'd  give me a little help on my lingo.  Also, you gas up the car first,  then try to sell 'em the oil\u2014right?\"\n\n\n \"Right,\" said Pembroke wearily.  \"What's wrong with your  lingo? Other than the fact that  it's not colloquial enough.\"\n\n\n \"Not enough slang, huh? Well,  I guess I'll have to concentrate  on that. How about the smile?\"\n\n\n \"Perfect,\" Pembroke told him.\n\n\n \"Yeah?\" said the boy delightedly.  \"Say, come back again,  huh? I sure appreciate the help.  Keep the map.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks. One more thing,\"  Pembroke said. \"What's over  that way\u2014outside the city?\"\n\n\n \"Sand.\"\n\n\n \"How about that way?\" he  asked, pointing north. \"And that  way?\" pointing south.\n\n\n \"More of the same.\"\n\n\n \"Any railroads?\"\n\n\n \"That we ain't got.\"\n\n\n \"Buses? Airlines?\"\n\n\n The kid shook his head.\n\n\n \"Some city.\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, it's kinda isolated. A  lot of ships dock here, though.\"\n\n\n \"All cargo ships, I'll bet. No  passengers,\" said Pembroke.\n\n\n \"Right,\" said the attendant,  giving with his perfect smile.\n\n\n \"No getting out of here, is  there?\"\n\n\n \"That's for sure,\" the boy said,  walking away to wait on another  customer. \"If you don't like the  place, you've had it.\" Pembroke returned to the  hotel. Going to the bar, he recognized  one of the Elena Mia's paying  passengers. He was a short,  rectangular little man in his fifties  named Spencer. He sat in a  booth with three young women,  all lovely, all effusive. The topic  of the conversation turned out  to be precisely what Pembroke  had predicted.\n\n\n \"Well, Louisa, I'd say your  only fault is the way you keep  wigglin' your shoulders up 'n'  down. Why'n'sha try holdin' 'em  straight?\"\n\n\n \"I thought it made me look  sexy,\" the redhead said petulantly.\n\n\n \"Just be yourself, gal,\" Spencer  drawled, jabbing her intimately  with a fat elbow, \"and  you'll qualify.\"\n\n\n \"Me, me,\" the blonde with a  feather cut was insisting. \"What  is wrong with me?\"\n\n\n \"You're perfect, sweetheart,\"  he told her, taking her hand.\n\n\n \"Ah, come on,\" she pleaded.  \"Everyone tells me I chew gum  with my mouth open. Don't you  hate that?\"\n\n\n \"Naw, that's part of your  charm,\" Spencer assured her.\n\n\n \"How 'bout me, sugar,\" asked  the girl with the coal black hair.\n\n\n \"Ah, you're perfect, too. You  are all perfect. I've never seen  such a collection of dolls as parade  around this here city.  C'mon, kids\u2014how 'bout another  round?\"\n\n\n But the dolls had apparently  lost interest in him. They got up  one by one and walked out of the  bar. Pembroke took his rum and  tonic and moved over to Spencer's  booth.\n\n\n \"Okay if I join you?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said the fat man.  \"Wonder what the hell got into  those babes?\"\n\n\n \"You said they were perfect.  They know they're not. You've  got to be rough with them in this  town,\" said Pembroke. \"That's  all they want from us.\"\n\n\n \"Mister, you've been doing  some thinkin', I can see,\" said  Spencer, peering at him suspiciously.  \"Maybe you've figured  out where we are.\"\n\n\n \"Your bet's as good as mine,\"  said Pembroke. \"It's not Wellington,  and it's not Brisbane, and  it's not Long Beach, and it's not  Tahiti. There are a lot of places  it's not. But where the hell it is,  you tell me.\n\n\n \"And, by the way,\" he added,  \"I hope you like it in Puerto  Pacifico. Because there isn't any  place to go from here and there  isn't any way to get there if  there were.\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, gentlemen, but  I'm Joe Valencia, manager of the  hotel. I would be very grateful if  you would give me a few minutes  of honest criticism.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, no, not you, too,\" groaned  Spencer. \"Look, Joe, what's  the gag?\"\n\n\n \"You are newcomers, Mr.  Spencer,\" Valencia explained.  \"You are therefore in an excellent  position to point out our  faults as you see them.\"\n\n\n \"Well, so what?\" demanded  Spencer. \"I've got more important  things to do than to worry  about your troubles. You look  okay to me.\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Valencia,\" said Pembroke.  \"I've noticed that you  walk with a very slight limp. If  you have a bad leg, I should  think you would do better to develop  a more pronounced limp.  Otherwise, you may appear to  be self-conscious about it.\" Spencer opened his mouth to  protest, but saw with amazement  that it was exactly this that  Valencia was seeking. Pembroke  was amused at his companion's  reaction but observed that Spencer  still failed to see the point.\n\n\n \"Also, there is a certain effeminateness  in the way in which  you speak,\" said Pembroke. \"Try  to be a little more direct, a little  more brusque. Speak in a monotone.  It will make you more acceptable.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you so much,\" said the  manager. \"There is much food  for thought in what you have  said, Mr. Pembroke. However,  Mr. Spencer, your value has failed  to prove itself. You have only  yourself to blame. Cooperation is  all we require of you.\"\n\n\n Valencia left. Spencer ordered  another martini. Neither he nor  Pembroke spoke for several minutes.\n\n\n \"Somebody's crazy around  here,\" the fat man muttered  after a few moments. \"Is it me,  Frank?\"\n\n\n \"No. You just don't belong  here, in this particular place,\"  said Pembroke thoughtfully.  \"You're the wrong type. But they  couldn't know that ahead of time.  The way they operate it's a  pretty hit-or-miss operation. But  they don't care one bit about us,  Spencer. Consider the men who  went down with the ship. That  was just part of the game.\"\n\n\n \"What the hell are you sayin'?\"  asked Spencer in disbelief.  \"You figure they sunk the ship?  Valencia and the waitress and  the three babes? Ah, come on.\"\n\n\n \"It's what you think that will  determine what you do, Spencer.  I suggest you change your attitude;  play along with them for a  few days till the picture becomes  a little clearer to you. We'll talk  about it again then.\"\n\n\n Pembroke rose and started out  of the bar. A policeman entered  and walked directly to Spencer's  table. Loitering at the juke box,  Pembroke overheard the conversation.\n\n\n \"You Spencer?\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said the fat  man sullenly.\n\n\n \"What don't you like about  me? The truth , buddy.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, hell! Nothin' wrong  with you at all, and nothin'll  make me say there is,\" said Spencer.\n\n\n \"You're the guy, all right. Too  bad, Mac,\" said the cop.\n\n\n Pembroke heard the shots as  he strolled casually out into the  brightness of the hotel lobby.  While he waited for the elevator,  he saw them carrying the body  into the street. How many others,  he wondered, had gone out on  their backs during their first day  in Puerto Pacifico? Pembroke shaved, showered,  and put on the new suit and shirt  he had bought. Then he took  Mary Ann, the woman he had  met on the beach, out to dinner.  She would look magnificent even  when fully clothed, he decided,  and the pale chartreuse gown she  wore hardly placed her in that  category. Her conversation seemed  considerably more normal  after the other denizens of  Puerto Pacifico Pembroke had  listened to that afternoon.\n\n\n After eating they danced for  an hour, had a few more drinks,  then went to Pembroke's room.  He still knew nothing about her  and had almost exhausted his  critical capabilities, but not once  had she become annoyed with  him. She seemed to devour every  factual point of imperfection  about herself that Pembroke  brought to her attention. And,  fantastically enough, she actually  appeared to have overcome every  little imperfection he had been  able to communicate to her.\n\n\n It was in the privacy of his  room that Pembroke became  aware of just how perfect, physically,  Mary Ann was. Too perfect.  No freckles or moles anywhere  on the visible surface of  her brown skin, which was more  than a mere sampling. Furthermore,  her face and body were  meticulously symmetrical. And  she seemed to be wholly ambidextrous.\n\n\n \"With so many beautiful  women in Puerto Pacifico,\" said  Pembroke probingly, \"I find it  hard to understand why there are  so few children.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, children are decorative,  aren't they,\" said Mary Ann. \"I  do wish there were more of  them.\"\n\n\n \"Why not have a couple of  your own?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Oh, they're only given to maternal  types. I'd never get one.  Anyway, I won't ever marry,\"  she said. \"I'm the paramour  type.\"\n\n\n It was obvious that the liquor  had been having some effect.  Either that, or she had a basic  flaw of loquacity that no one else  had discovered. Pembroke decided  he would have to cover his  tracks carefully.\n\n\n \"What type am I?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Silly, you're real. You're not  a type at all.\"\n\n\n \"Mary Ann, I love you very  much,\" Pembroke murmured,  gambling everything on this one  throw. \"When you go to Earth  I'll miss you terribly.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, but you'll be dead by  then,\" she pouted. \"So I mustn't  fall in love with you. I don't want  to be miserable.\"\n\n\n \"If I pretended I was one of  you, if I left on the boat with  you, they'd let me go to Earth  with you. Wouldn't they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes, I'm sure they would.\"\n\n\n \"Mary Ann, you have two  other flaws I feel I should mention.\"\n\n\n \"Yes? Please tell me.\"\n\n\n \"In the first place,\" said Pembroke,  \"you should be willing to  fall in love with me even if it  will eventually make you unhappy.  How can you be the paramour  type if you refuse to fall in  love foolishly? And when you  have fallen in love, you should be  very loyal.\"\n\n\n \"I'll try,\" she said unsurely.  \"What else?\"\n\n\n \"The other thing is that, as  my mistress, you must never  mention me to anyone. It would  place me in great danger.\"\n\n\n \"I'll never tell anyone anything  about you,\" she promised.\n\n\n \"Now try to love me,\" Pembroke  said, drawing her into his  arms and kissing with little  pleasure the smooth, warm perfection  of her tanned cheeks.  \"Love me my sweet, beautiful,  affectionate Mary Ann. My paramour.\"\n\n\n Making love to Mary Ann was  something short of ecstasy. Not  for any obvious reason, but because  of subtle little factors that  make a woman a woman. Mary  Ann had no pulse. Mary Ann did  not perspire. Mary Ann did not  fatigue gradually but all at once.  Mary Ann breathed regularly  under all circumstances. Mary  Ann talked and talked and talked.  But then, Mary Ann was not  a human being.\n\n\n When she left the hotel at midnight,  Pembroke was quite sure  that she understood his plan and  that she was irrevocably in love  with him. Tomorrow might bring  his death, but it might also ensure  his escape. After forty-two  years of searching for a passion,  for a cause, for a loyalty, Frank  Pembroke had at last found his.  Earth and the human race that  peopled it. And Mary Ann would  help him to save it. The next morning Pembroke  talked to Valencia about hunting.  He said that he planned to go  shooting out on the desert which  surrounded the city. Valencia  told him that there were no living  creatures anywhere but in  the city. Pembroke said he was  going out anyway.\n\n\n He picked up Mary Ann at her  apartment and together they  went to a sporting goods store.  As he guessed there was a goodly  selection of firearms, despite the  fact that there was nothing to  hunt and only a single target  range within the city. Everything,  of course, had to be just  like Earth. That, after all, was  the purpose of Puerto Pacifico.\n\n\n By noon they had rented a  jeep and were well away from  the city. Pembroke and Mary  Ann took turns firing at the paper  targets they had purchased. At  twilight they headed back to the  city. On the outskirts, where the  sand and soil were mixed and no  footprints would be left, Pembroke  hopped off. Mary Ann  would go straight to the police  and report that Pembroke had attacked  her and that she had shot  him. If necessary, she would conduct  the authorities to the place  where they had been target  shooting, but would be unable to  locate the spot where she had  buried the body. Why had she  buried it? Because at first she  was not going to report the incident.  She was frightened. It  was not airtight, but there would  probably be no further investigation.  And they certainly would  not prosecute Mary Ann for killing  an Earthman.\n\n\n Now Pembroke had himself to  worry about. The first step was  to enter smoothly into the new  life he had planned. It wouldn't  be so comfortable as the previous  one, but should be considerably  safer. He headed slowly for the  \"old\" part of town, aging his  clothes against buildings and  fences as he walked. He had already  torn the collar of the shirt  and discarded his belt. By morning  his beard would grow to  blacken his face. And he would  look weary and hungry and aimless.  Only the last would be a deception. Two weeks later Pembroke  phoned Mary Ann. The police  had accepted her story without  even checking. And when, when  would she be seeing him again?  He had aroused her passion and  no amount of long-distance love  could requite it. Soon, he assured  her, soon.\n\n\n \"Because, after all, you do owe  me something,\" she added.\n\n\n And that was bad because it  sounded as if she had been giving  some womanly thought to the situation.  A little more of that and  she might go to the police again,  this time for vengeance.\n\n\n Twice during his wanderings  Pembroke had seen the corpses  of Earthmen being carted out of  buildings. They had to be Earthmen  because they bled. Mary Ann  had admitted that she did not.  There would be very few Earthmen  left in Puerto Pacifico, and  it would be simple enough to locate  him if he were reported as  being on the loose. There was  no out but to do away with Mary  Ann.\n\n\n Pembroke headed for the  beach. He knew she invariably  went there in the afternoon. He  loitered around the stalls where  hot dogs and soft drinks were  sold, leaning against a post in  the hot sun, hat pulled down over  his forehead. Then he noticed  that people all about him were  talking excitedly. They were discussing  a ship. It was leaving  that afternoon. Anyone who  could pass the interview would  be sent to Earth.\n\n\n Pembroke had visited the  docks every day, without being  able to learn when the great  exodus would take place. Yet he  was certain the first lap would be  by water rather than by spaceship,  since no one he had talked  to in the city had ever heard of  spaceships. In fact, they knew  very little about their masters.\n\n\n Now the ship had arrived and  was to leave shortly. If there was  any but the most superficial examination,  Pembroke would no  doubt be discovered and exterminated.  But since no one seemed  concerned about anything but his  own speech and behavior, he assumed  that they had all qualified  in every other respect. The reason  for transporting Earth People  to this planet was, of course,  to apply a corrective to any of  the Pacificos' aberrant mannerisms  or articulation. This was  the polishing up phase. Pembroke began hobbling toward  the docks. Almost at once  he found himself face to face  with Mary Ann. She smiled happily  when she recognized him. That was a good thing.\n\n\n \"It is a sign of poor breeding  to smile at tramps,\" Pembroke  admonished her in a whisper.  \"Walk on ahead.\"\n\n\n She obeyed. He followed. The  crowd grew thicker. They neared  the docks and Pembroke saw that  there were now set up on the  roped-off wharves small interviewing  booths. When it was  their turn, he and Mary Ann  each went into separate ones.  Pembroke found himself alone in  the little room.\n\n\n Then he saw that there was  another entity in his presence  confined beneath a glass dome. It  looked rather like a groundhog  and had seven fingers on each of  its six limbs. But it was larger  and hairier than the glass one  he had seen at the gift store.  With four of its limbs it tapped  on an intricate keyboard in front  of it.\n\n\n \"What is your name?\" queried  a metallic voice from a speaker  on the wall.\n\n\n \"I'm Jerry Newton. Got no  middle initial,\" Pembroke said in  a surly voice.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"I work a lot o' trades. Fisherman,  fruit picker, fightin' range  fires, vineyards, car washer. Anything.  You name it. Been out of  work for a long time now,  though. Goin' on five months.  These here are hard times, no  matter what they say.\"\n\n\n \"What do you think of the  Chinese situation?\" the voice inquired.\n\n\n \"Which situation's 'at?\"\n\n\n \"Where's Seattle?\"\n\n\n \"Seattle? State o' Washington.\"\n\n\n And so it went for about five  minutes. Then he was told he  had qualified as a satisfactory  surrogate for a mid-twentieth  century American male, itinerant  type.\n\n\n \"You understand your mission,  Newton?\" the voice asked. \"You  are to establish yourself on  Earth. In time you will receive  instructions. Then you will attack.  You will not see us, your  masters, again until the atmosphere  has been sufficiently chlorinated.  In the meantime, serve  us well.\"\n\n\n He stumbled out toward the  docks, then looked about for  Mary Ann. He saw her at last  behind the ropes, her lovely face  in tears.\n\n\n Then she saw him. Waving  frantically, she called his name  several times. Pembroke mingled  with the crowd moving toward  the ship, ignoring her. But still  the woman persisted in her  shouting.\n\n\n Sidling up to a well-dressed  man-about-town type, Pembroke  winked at him and snickered.\n\n\n \"You Frank?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Hell, no. But some poor  punk's sure red in the face, I'll  bet,\" the man-about-town said  with a chuckle. \"Those high-strung  paramour types always  raising a ruckus. They never do  pass the interview. Don't know  why they even make 'em.\"\n\n\n Suddenly Mary Ann was quiet.\n\n\n \"Ambulance squad,\" Pembroke's  companion explained.  \"They'll take her off to the buggy  house for a few days and bring  her out fresh and ignorant as the  day she was assembled. Don't  know why they keep making 'em,  as I say. But I guess there's a  call for that type up there on  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, I reckon there is at  that,\" said Pembroke, snickering  again as he moved away from the  other. \"And why not? Hey?  Why not?\"\n\n\n Pembroke went right on hating  himself, however, till the  night he was deposited in a field  outside of Ensenada, broke but  happy, with two other itinerant  types. They separated in San  Diego, and it was not long before  Pembroke was explaining to the  police how he had drifted far  from the scene of the sinking of  the Elena Mia on a piece of  wreckage, and had been picked  up by a Chilean trawler. How he  had then made his way, with  much suffering, up the coast to  California. Two days later, his  identity established and his circumstances  again solvent, he was  headed for Los Angeles to begin  his save-Earth campaign. Now, seated at his battered  desk in the shabby rented office  over Lemark's Liquors, Pembroke  gazed without emotion at  the two demolished Pacificos that  lay sprawled one atop the other  in the corner. His watch said  one-fifteen. The man from the  FBI should arrive soon.\n\n\n There were footsteps on the  stairs for the third time that  day. Not the brisk, efficient steps  of a federal official, but the hesitant,  self-conscious steps of a  junior clerk type.\n\n\n Pembroke rose as the young  man appeared at the door. His  face was smooth, unpimpled,  clean-shaven, without sweat on a  warm summer afternoon.\n\n\n \"Are you Dr. Von Schubert?\"  the newcomer asked, peering into  the room. \"You see, I've got a  problem\u2014\"\n\n\n The four shots from Pembroke's  pistol solved his problem  effectively. Pembroke tossed his  third victim onto the pile, then  opened a can of lager, quaffing  it appreciatively. Seating himself  once more, he leaned back in  the chair, both feet upon the  desk.\n\n\n He would be out of business  soon, once the FBI agent had got  there. Pembroke was only in it to  get the proof he would need to  convince people of the truth of  his tale. But in the meantime he  allowed himself to admire the  clipping of the newspaper ad he  had run in all the Los Angeles  papers for the past week. The  little ad that had saved mankind  from God-knew-what insidious  menace. It read: ARE YOU IMPERFECT? LET DR. VON SCHUBERT POINT OUT\n\n YOUR FLAWS IT IS HIS GOAL TO MAKE YOU THE\n\n AVERAGE FOR YOUR TYPE FEE\u2014$3.75 MONEY BACK IF NOT SATISFIED!

Do you fail to fit in with your group?  Nervous, anxious, ill-at-ease? Happy  about it? Lucky you! Frank Pembroke  sat behind  the desk of his shabby  little office over Lemark's Liquors  in downtown Los Angeles and  waited for his first customer. He  had been in business for a week  and as yet had had no callers.  Therefore, it was with a mingled  sense of excitement and satisfaction  that he greeted the tall,  dark, smooth-faced figure that  came up the stairs and into the  office shortly before noon.\n\n\n \"Good day, sir,\" said Pembroke  with an amiable smile. \"I  see my advertisement has interested  you. Please stand in that  corner for just a moment.\"\n\n\n Opening the desk drawer,  which was almost empty, Pembroke  removed an automatic pistol  fitted with a silencer. Pointing  it at the amazed customer, he  fired four .22 caliber longs into  the narrow chest. Then he made  a telephone call and sat down to  wait. He wondered how long it  would be before his next client  would arrive. The series of events leading up  to Pembroke's present occupation  had commenced on a dismal,  overcast evening in the South  Pacific a year earlier. Bound for  Sydney, two days out of Valparaiso,  the Colombian tramp  steamer Elena Mia had encountered  a dense greenish fog which  seemed vaguely redolent of citrus  trees. Standing on the forward  deck, Pembroke was one of the  first to perceive the peculiar odor  and to spot the immense gray  hulk wallowing in the murky distance.\n\n\n Then the explosion had come,  from far below the waterline,  and the decks were awash with  frantic crewmen, officers, and the  handful of passengers. Only two  lifeboats were launched before  the Elena Mia went down. Pembroke  was in the second. The  roar of the sinking ship was the  last thing he heard for some  time.\n\n\n Pembroke came as close to being  a professional adventurer as  one can in these days of regimented  travel, organized peril,  and political restriction. He had  made for himself a substantial  fortune through speculation in a  great variety of properties, real  and otherwise. Life had given  him much and demanded little,  which was perhaps the reason  for his restiveness. Loyalty to person or to people  was a trait Pembroke had never  recognized in himself, nor had it  ever been expected of him. And  yet he greatly envied those  staunch patriots and lovers who  could find it in themselves to  elevate the glory and safety of  others above that of themselves.\n\n\n Lacking such loyalties, Pembroke  adapted quickly to the situation  in which he found himself  when he regained consciousness.  He awoke in a small room in  what appeared to be a typical  modern American hotel. The wallet  in his pocket contained exactly  what it should, approximately  three hundred dollars.  His next thought was of food.  He left the room and descended  via the elevator to the restaurant.  Here he observed that it  was early afternoon. Ordering  a full dinner, for he was unusually  hungry, he began to study the  others in the restaurant.\n\n\n Many of the faces seemed familiar;  the crew of the ship,  probably. He also recognized several  of the passengers. However,  he made no attempt to speak to  them. After his meal, he bought  a good corona and went for a  walk. His situation could have  been any small western American  seacoast city. He heard the hiss  of the ocean in the direction the  afternoon sun was taking. In his  full-gaited walk, he was soon approaching  the beach.\n\n\n On the sand he saw a number  of sun bathers. One in particular,  an attractive woman of about  thirty, tossed back her long,  chestnut locks and gazed up intently  at Pembroke as he passed.  Seldom had he enjoyed so ingenuous  an invitation. He halted  and stared down at her for a few  moments.\n\n\n \"You are looking for someone?\"  she inquired.\n\n\n \"Much of the time,\" said the  man.\n\n\n \"Could it be me?\"\n\n\n \"It could be.\"\n\n\n \"Yet you seem unsure,\" she  said.\n\n\n Pembroke smiled, uneasily.  There was something not entirely  normal about her conversation.  Though the rest of her compensated  for that.\n\n\n \"Tell me what's wrong with  me,\" she went on urgently. \"I'm  not good enough, am I? I mean,  there's something wrong with  the way I look or act. Isn't there?  Please help me, please!\"\n\n\n \"You're not casual enough, for  one thing,\" said Pembroke, deciding  to play along with her for  the moment. \"You're too tense.  Also you're a bit knock-kneed,  not that it matters. Is that what  you wanted to hear?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes\u2014I mean, I suppose  so. I can try to be more casual.  But I don't know what to do  about my knees,\" she said wistfully,  staring across at the  smooth, tan limbs. \"Do you think  I'm okay otherwise? I mean, as a  whole I'm not so bad, am I? Oh,  please tell me.\"\n\n\n \"How about talking it over at  supper tonight?\" Pembroke proposed.  \"Maybe with less distraction  I'll have a better picture of  you\u2014as a whole.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very generous of  you,\" the woman told him. She  scribbled a name and an address  on a small piece of paper and  handed it to him. \"Any time  after six,\" she said.\n\n\n Pembroke left the beach and  walked through several small  specialty shops. He tried to get  the woman off his mind, but the  oddness of her conversation continued  to bother him. She was  right about being different, but  it was her concern about being  different that made her so. How  to explain that to her? Then he saw the weird little  glass statuette among the usual  bric-a-brac. It rather resembled  a ground hog, had seven fingers  on each of its six limbs, and  smiled up at him as he stared.\n\n\n \"Can I help you, sir?\" a middle-aged  saleswoman inquired.  \"Oh, good heavens, whatever is  that thing doing here?\"\n\n\n Pembroke watched with lifted  eyebrows as the clerk whisked  the bizarre statuette underneath  the counter.\n\n\n \"What the hell was that?\"  Pembroke demanded.\n\n\n \"Oh, you know\u2014or don't you?  Oh, my,\" she concluded, \"are you  one of the\u2014strangers?\"\n\n\n \"And if I were?\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'd certainly appreciate  it if you'd tell me how I walk.\" She came around in front of  the counter and strutted back  and forth a few times.\n\n\n \"They tell me I lean too far  forward,\" she confided. \"But I  should think you'd fall down if  you didn't.\"\n\n\n \"Don't try to go so fast and  you won't fall down,\" suggested  Pembroke. \"You're in too much  of a hurry. Also those fake flowers  on your blouse make you look  frumpy.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'm supposed to look  frumpy,\" the woman retorted.  \"That's the type of person I am.  But you can look frumpy and still  walk natural, can't you? Everyone  says you can.\"\n\n\n \"Well, they've got a point,\"  said Pembroke. \"Incidentally,  just where are we, anyway?  What city is this?\"\n\n\n \"Puerto Pacifico,\" she told  him. \"Isn't that a lovely name?  It means peaceful port. In Spanish.\"\n\n\n That was fine. At least he now  knew where he was. But as he  left the shop he began checking  off every west coast state, city,  town, and inlet. None, to the best  of his knowledge, was called  Puerto Pacifico.\n\n\n He headed for the nearest  service station and asked for a  map. The attendant gave him one  which showed the city, but nothing  beyond.\n\n\n \"Which way is it to San Francisco?\"  asked Pembroke.\n\n\n \"That all depends on where  you are,\" the boy returned.\n\n\n \"Okay, then where am I?\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, there's a customer,\"  the boy said. \"This is  Puerto Pacifico.\"\n\n\n Pembroke watched him hurry  off to service a car with a sense  of having been given the runaround.  To his surprise, the boy  came back a few minutes later  after servicing the automobile.\n\n\n \"Say, I've just figured out who  you are,\" the youngster told him.  \"I'd sure appreciate it if you'd  give me a little help on my lingo.  Also, you gas up the car first,  then try to sell 'em the oil\u2014right?\"\n\n\n \"Right,\" said Pembroke wearily.  \"What's wrong with your  lingo? Other than the fact that  it's not colloquial enough.\"\n\n\n \"Not enough slang, huh? Well,  I guess I'll have to concentrate  on that. How about the smile?\"\n\n\n \"Perfect,\" Pembroke told him.\n\n\n \"Yeah?\" said the boy delightedly.  \"Say, come back again,  huh? I sure appreciate the help.  Keep the map.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks. One more thing,\"  Pembroke said. \"What's over  that way\u2014outside the city?\"\n\n\n \"Sand.\"\n\n\n \"How about that way?\" he  asked, pointing north. \"And that  way?\" pointing south.\n\n\n \"More of the same.\"\n\n\n \"Any railroads?\"\n\n\n \"That we ain't got.\"\n\n\n \"Buses? Airlines?\"\n\n\n The kid shook his head.\n\n\n \"Some city.\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, it's kinda isolated. A  lot of ships dock here, though.\"\n\n\n \"All cargo ships, I'll bet. No  passengers,\" said Pembroke.\n\n\n \"Right,\" said the attendant,  giving with his perfect smile.\n\n\n \"No getting out of here, is  there?\"\n\n\n \"That's for sure,\" the boy said,  walking away to wait on another  customer. \"If you don't like the  place, you've had it.\" Pembroke returned to the  hotel. Going to the bar, he recognized  one of the Elena Mia's paying  passengers. He was a short,  rectangular little man in his fifties  named Spencer. He sat in a  booth with three young women,  all lovely, all effusive. The topic  of the conversation turned out  to be precisely what Pembroke  had predicted.\n\n\n \"Well, Louisa, I'd say your  only fault is the way you keep  wigglin' your shoulders up 'n'  down. Why'n'sha try holdin' 'em  straight?\"\n\n\n \"I thought it made me look  sexy,\" the redhead said petulantly.\n\n\n \"Just be yourself, gal,\" Spencer  drawled, jabbing her intimately  with a fat elbow, \"and  you'll qualify.\"\n\n\n \"Me, me,\" the blonde with a  feather cut was insisting. \"What  is wrong with me?\"\n\n\n \"You're perfect, sweetheart,\"  he told her, taking her hand.\n\n\n \"Ah, come on,\" she pleaded.  \"Everyone tells me I chew gum  with my mouth open. Don't you  hate that?\"\n\n\n \"Naw, that's part of your  charm,\" Spencer assured her.\n\n\n \"How 'bout me, sugar,\" asked  the girl with the coal black hair.\n\n\n \"Ah, you're perfect, too. You  are all perfect. I've never seen  such a collection of dolls as parade  around this here city.  C'mon, kids\u2014how 'bout another  round?\"\n\n\n But the dolls had apparently  lost interest in him. They got up  one by one and walked out of the  bar. Pembroke took his rum and  tonic and moved over to Spencer's  booth.\n\n\n \"Okay if I join you?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said the fat man.  \"Wonder what the hell got into  those babes?\"\n\n\n \"You said they were perfect.  They know they're not. You've  got to be rough with them in this  town,\" said Pembroke. \"That's  all they want from us.\"\n\n\n \"Mister, you've been doing  some thinkin', I can see,\" said  Spencer, peering at him suspiciously.  \"Maybe you've figured  out where we are.\"\n\n\n \"Your bet's as good as mine,\"  said Pembroke. \"It's not Wellington,  and it's not Brisbane, and  it's not Long Beach, and it's not  Tahiti. There are a lot of places  it's not. But where the hell it is,  you tell me.\n\n\n \"And, by the way,\" he added,  \"I hope you like it in Puerto  Pacifico. Because there isn't any  place to go from here and there  isn't any way to get there if  there were.\"\n\n\n \"Pardon me, gentlemen, but  I'm Joe Valencia, manager of the  hotel. I would be very grateful if  you would give me a few minutes  of honest criticism.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, no, not you, too,\" groaned  Spencer. \"Look, Joe, what's  the gag?\"\n\n\n \"You are newcomers, Mr.  Spencer,\" Valencia explained.  \"You are therefore in an excellent  position to point out our  faults as you see them.\"\n\n\n \"Well, so what?\" demanded  Spencer. \"I've got more important  things to do than to worry  about your troubles. You look  okay to me.\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Valencia,\" said Pembroke.  \"I've noticed that you  walk with a very slight limp. If  you have a bad leg, I should  think you would do better to develop  a more pronounced limp.  Otherwise, you may appear to  be self-conscious about it.\" Spencer opened his mouth to  protest, but saw with amazement  that it was exactly this that  Valencia was seeking. Pembroke  was amused at his companion's  reaction but observed that Spencer  still failed to see the point.\n\n\n \"Also, there is a certain effeminateness  in the way in which  you speak,\" said Pembroke. \"Try  to be a little more direct, a little  more brusque. Speak in a monotone.  It will make you more acceptable.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you so much,\" said the  manager. \"There is much food  for thought in what you have  said, Mr. Pembroke. However,  Mr. Spencer, your value has failed  to prove itself. You have only  yourself to blame. Cooperation is  all we require of you.\"\n\n\n Valencia left. Spencer ordered  another martini. Neither he nor  Pembroke spoke for several minutes.\n\n\n \"Somebody's crazy around  here,\" the fat man muttered  after a few moments. \"Is it me,  Frank?\"\n\n\n \"No. You just don't belong  here, in this particular place,\"  said Pembroke thoughtfully.  \"You're the wrong type. But they  couldn't know that ahead of time.  The way they operate it's a  pretty hit-or-miss operation. But  they don't care one bit about us,  Spencer. Consider the men who  went down with the ship. That  was just part of the game.\"\n\n\n \"What the hell are you sayin'?\"  asked Spencer in disbelief.  \"You figure they sunk the ship?  Valencia and the waitress and  the three babes? Ah, come on.\"\n\n\n \"It's what you think that will  determine what you do, Spencer.  I suggest you change your attitude;  play along with them for a  few days till the picture becomes  a little clearer to you. We'll talk  about it again then.\"\n\n\n Pembroke rose and started out  of the bar. A policeman entered  and walked directly to Spencer's  table. Loitering at the juke box,  Pembroke overheard the conversation.\n\n\n \"You Spencer?\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said the fat  man sullenly.\n\n\n \"What don't you like about  me? The truth , buddy.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, hell! Nothin' wrong  with you at all, and nothin'll  make me say there is,\" said Spencer.\n\n\n \"You're the guy, all right. Too  bad, Mac,\" said the cop.\n\n\n Pembroke heard the shots as  he strolled casually out into the  brightness of the hotel lobby.  While he waited for the elevator,  he saw them carrying the body  into the street. How many others,  he wondered, had gone out on  their backs during their first day  in Puerto Pacifico? Pembroke shaved, showered,  and put on the new suit and shirt  he had bought. Then he took  Mary Ann, the woman he had  met on the beach, out to dinner.  She would look magnificent even  when fully clothed, he decided,  and the pale chartreuse gown she  wore hardly placed her in that  category. Her conversation seemed  considerably more normal  after the other denizens of  Puerto Pacifico Pembroke had  listened to that afternoon.\n\n\n After eating they danced for  an hour, had a few more drinks,  then went to Pembroke's room.  He still knew nothing about her  and had almost exhausted his  critical capabilities, but not once  had she become annoyed with  him. She seemed to devour every  factual point of imperfection  about herself that Pembroke  brought to her attention. And,  fantastically enough, she actually  appeared to have overcome every  little imperfection he had been  able to communicate to her.\n\n\n It was in the privacy of his  room that Pembroke became  aware of just how perfect, physically,  Mary Ann was. Too perfect.  No freckles or moles anywhere  on the visible surface of  her brown skin, which was more  than a mere sampling. Furthermore,  her face and body were  meticulously symmetrical. And  she seemed to be wholly ambidextrous.\n\n\n \"With so many beautiful  women in Puerto Pacifico,\" said  Pembroke probingly, \"I find it  hard to understand why there are  so few children.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, children are decorative,  aren't they,\" said Mary Ann. \"I  do wish there were more of  them.\"\n\n\n \"Why not have a couple of  your own?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Oh, they're only given to maternal  types. I'd never get one.  Anyway, I won't ever marry,\"  she said. \"I'm the paramour  type.\"\n\n\n It was obvious that the liquor  had been having some effect.  Either that, or she had a basic  flaw of loquacity that no one else  had discovered. Pembroke decided  he would have to cover his  tracks carefully.\n\n\n \"What type am I?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Silly, you're real. You're not  a type at all.\"\n\n\n \"Mary Ann, I love you very  much,\" Pembroke murmured,  gambling everything on this one  throw. \"When you go to Earth  I'll miss you terribly.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, but you'll be dead by  then,\" she pouted. \"So I mustn't  fall in love with you. I don't want  to be miserable.\"\n\n\n \"If I pretended I was one of  you, if I left on the boat with  you, they'd let me go to Earth  with you. Wouldn't they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes, I'm sure they would.\"\n\n\n \"Mary Ann, you have two  other flaws I feel I should mention.\"\n\n\n \"Yes? Please tell me.\"\n\n\n \"In the first place,\" said Pembroke,  \"you should be willing to  fall in love with me even if it  will eventually make you unhappy.  How can you be the paramour  type if you refuse to fall in  love foolishly? And when you  have fallen in love, you should be  very loyal.\"\n\n\n \"I'll try,\" she said unsurely.  \"What else?\"\n\n\n \"The other thing is that, as  my mistress, you must never  mention me to anyone. It would  place me in great danger.\"\n\n\n \"I'll never tell anyone anything  about you,\" she promised.\n\n\n \"Now try to love me,\" Pembroke  said, drawing her into his  arms and kissing with little  pleasure the smooth, warm perfection  of her tanned cheeks.  \"Love me my sweet, beautiful,  affectionate Mary Ann. My paramour.\"\n\n\n Making love to Mary Ann was  something short of ecstasy. Not  for any obvious reason, but because  of subtle little factors that  make a woman a woman. Mary  Ann had no pulse. Mary Ann did  not perspire. Mary Ann did not  fatigue gradually but all at once.  Mary Ann breathed regularly  under all circumstances. Mary  Ann talked and talked and talked.  But then, Mary Ann was not  a human being.\n\n\n When she left the hotel at midnight,  Pembroke was quite sure  that she understood his plan and  that she was irrevocably in love  with him. Tomorrow might bring  his death, but it might also ensure  his escape. After forty-two  years of searching for a passion,  for a cause, for a loyalty, Frank  Pembroke had at last found his.  Earth and the human race that  peopled it. And Mary Ann would  help him to save it. The next morning Pembroke  talked to Valencia about hunting.  He said that he planned to go  shooting out on the desert which  surrounded the city. Valencia  told him that there were no living  creatures anywhere but in  the city. Pembroke said he was  going out anyway.\n\n\n He picked up Mary Ann at her  apartment and together they  went to a sporting goods store.  As he guessed there was a goodly  selection of firearms, despite the  fact that there was nothing to  hunt and only a single target  range within the city. Everything,  of course, had to be just  like Earth. That, after all, was  the purpose of Puerto Pacifico.\n\n\n By noon they had rented a  jeep and were well away from  the city. Pembroke and Mary  Ann took turns firing at the paper  targets they had purchased. At  twilight they headed back to the  city. On the outskirts, where the  sand and soil were mixed and no  footprints would be left, Pembroke  hopped off. Mary Ann  would go straight to the police  and report that Pembroke had attacked  her and that she had shot  him. If necessary, she would conduct  the authorities to the place  where they had been target  shooting, but would be unable to  locate the spot where she had  buried the body. Why had she  buried it? Because at first she  was not going to report the incident.  She was frightened. It  was not airtight, but there would  probably be no further investigation.  And they certainly would  not prosecute Mary Ann for killing  an Earthman.\n\n\n Now Pembroke had himself to  worry about. The first step was  to enter smoothly into the new  life he had planned. It wouldn't  be so comfortable as the previous  one, but should be considerably  safer. He headed slowly for the  \"old\" part of town, aging his  clothes against buildings and  fences as he walked. He had already  torn the collar of the shirt  and discarded his belt. By morning  his beard would grow to  blacken his face. And he would  look weary and hungry and aimless.  Only the last would be a deception. Two weeks later Pembroke  phoned Mary Ann. The police  had accepted her story without  even checking. And when, when  would she be seeing him again?  He had aroused her passion and  no amount of long-distance love  could requite it. Soon, he assured  her, soon.\n\n\n \"Because, after all, you do owe  me something,\" she added.\n\n\n And that was bad because it  sounded as if she had been giving  some womanly thought to the situation.  A little more of that and  she might go to the police again,  this time for vengeance.\n\n\n Twice during his wanderings  Pembroke had seen the corpses  of Earthmen being carted out of  buildings. They had to be Earthmen  because they bled. Mary Ann  had admitted that she did not.  There would be very few Earthmen  left in Puerto Pacifico, and  it would be simple enough to locate  him if he were reported as  being on the loose. There was  no out but to do away with Mary  Ann.\n\n\n Pembroke headed for the  beach. He knew she invariably  went there in the afternoon. He  loitered around the stalls where  hot dogs and soft drinks were  sold, leaning against a post in  the hot sun, hat pulled down over  his forehead. Then he noticed  that people all about him were  talking excitedly. They were discussing  a ship. It was leaving  that afternoon. Anyone who  could pass the interview would  be sent to Earth.\n\n\n Pembroke had visited the  docks every day, without being  able to learn when the great  exodus would take place. Yet he  was certain the first lap would be  by water rather than by spaceship,  since no one he had talked  to in the city had ever heard of  spaceships. In fact, they knew  very little about their masters.\n\n\n Now the ship had arrived and  was to leave shortly. If there was  any but the most superficial examination,  Pembroke would no  doubt be discovered and exterminated.  But since no one seemed  concerned about anything but his  own speech and behavior, he assumed  that they had all qualified  in every other respect. The reason  for transporting Earth People  to this planet was, of course,  to apply a corrective to any of  the Pacificos' aberrant mannerisms  or articulation. This was  the polishing up phase. Pembroke began hobbling toward  the docks. Almost at once  he found himself face to face  with Mary Ann. She smiled happily  when she recognized him. That was a good thing.\n\n\n \"It is a sign of poor breeding  to smile at tramps,\" Pembroke  admonished her in a whisper.  \"Walk on ahead.\"\n\n\n She obeyed. He followed. The  crowd grew thicker. They neared  the docks and Pembroke saw that  there were now set up on the  roped-off wharves small interviewing  booths. When it was  their turn, he and Mary Ann  each went into separate ones.  Pembroke found himself alone in  the little room.\n\n\n Then he saw that there was  another entity in his presence  confined beneath a glass dome. It  looked rather like a groundhog  and had seven fingers on each of  its six limbs. But it was larger  and hairier than the glass one  he had seen at the gift store.  With four of its limbs it tapped  on an intricate keyboard in front  of it.\n\n\n \"What is your name?\" queried  a metallic voice from a speaker  on the wall.\n\n\n \"I'm Jerry Newton. Got no  middle initial,\" Pembroke said in  a surly voice.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"I work a lot o' trades. Fisherman,  fruit picker, fightin' range  fires, vineyards, car washer. Anything.  You name it. Been out of  work for a long time now,  though. Goin' on five months.  These here are hard times, no  matter what they say.\"\n\n\n \"What do you think of the  Chinese situation?\" the voice inquired.\n\n\n \"Which situation's 'at?\"\n\n\n \"Where's Seattle?\"\n\n\n \"Seattle? State o' Washington.\"\n\n\n And so it went for about five  minutes. Then he was told he  had qualified as a satisfactory  surrogate for a mid-twentieth  century American male, itinerant  type.\n\n\n \"You understand your mission,  Newton?\" the voice asked. \"You  are to establish yourself on  Earth. In time you will receive  instructions. Then you will attack.  You will not see us, your  masters, again until the atmosphere  has been sufficiently chlorinated.  In the meantime, serve  us well.\"\n\n\n He stumbled out toward the  docks, then looked about for  Mary Ann. He saw her at last  behind the ropes, her lovely face  in tears.\n\n\n Then she saw him. Waving  frantically, she called his name  several times. Pembroke mingled  with the crowd moving toward  the ship, ignoring her. But still  the woman persisted in her  shouting.\n\n\n Sidling up to a well-dressed  man-about-town type, Pembroke  winked at him and snickered.\n\n\n \"You Frank?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Hell, no. But some poor  punk's sure red in the face, I'll  bet,\" the man-about-town said  with a chuckle. \"Those high-strung  paramour types always  raising a ruckus. They never do  pass the interview. Don't know  why they even make 'em.\"\n\n\n Suddenly Mary Ann was quiet.\n\n\n \"Ambulance squad,\" Pembroke's  companion explained.  \"They'll take her off to the buggy  house for a few days and bring  her out fresh and ignorant as the  day she was assembled. Don't  know why they keep making 'em,  as I say. But I guess there's a  call for that type up there on  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, I reckon there is at  that,\" said Pembroke, snickering  again as he moved away from the  other. \"And why not? Hey?  Why not?\"\n\n\n Pembroke went right on hating  himself, however, till the  night he was deposited in a field  outside of Ensenada, broke but  happy, with two other itinerant  types. They separated in San  Diego, and it was not long before  Pembroke was explaining to the  police how he had drifted far  from the scene of the sinking of  the Elena Mia on a piece of  wreckage, and had been picked  up by a Chilean trawler. How he  had then made his way, with  much suffering, up the coast to  California. Two days later, his  identity established and his circumstances  again solvent, he was  headed for Los Angeles to begin  his save-Earth campaign. Now, seated at his battered  desk in the shabby rented office  over Lemark's Liquors, Pembroke  gazed without emotion at  the two demolished Pacificos that  lay sprawled one atop the other  in the corner. His watch said  one-fifteen. The man from the  FBI should arrive soon.\n\n\n There were footsteps on the  stairs for the third time that  day. Not the brisk, efficient steps  of a federal official, but the hesitant,  self-conscious steps of a  junior clerk type.\n\n\n Pembroke rose as the young  man appeared at the door. His  face was smooth, unpimpled,  clean-shaven, without sweat on a  warm summer afternoon.\n\n\n \"Are you Dr. Von Schubert?\"  the newcomer asked, peering into  the room. \"You see, I've got a  problem\u2014\"\n\n\n The four shots from Pembroke's  pistol solved his problem  effectively. Pembroke tossed his  third victim onto the pile, then  opened a can of lager, quaffing  it appreciatively. Seating himself  once more, he leaned back in  the chair, both feet upon the  desk.\n\n\n He would be out of business  soon, once the FBI agent had got  there. Pembroke was only in it to  get the proof he would need to  convince people of the truth of  his tale. But in the meantime he  allowed himself to admire the  clipping of the newspaper ad he  had run in all the Los Angeles  papers for the past week. The  little ad that had saved mankind  from God-knew-what insidious  menace. It read: ARE YOU IMPERFECT? LET DR. VON SCHUBERT POINT OUT\n\n YOUR FLAWS IT IS HIS GOAL TO MAKE YOU THE\n\n AVERAGE FOR YOUR TYPE FEE\u2014$3.75 MONEY BACK IF NOT SATISFIED!
