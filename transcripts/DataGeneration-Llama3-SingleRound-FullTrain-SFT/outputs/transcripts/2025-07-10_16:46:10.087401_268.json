      "background_text": "ACCIDENTAL DEATH BY PETER BAILY The most  dangerous of weapons     is the one you don't know is loaded. Illustrated by Schoenherr The  wind howled out of  the northwest, blind  with snow and barbed  with ice crystals. All  the way up the half-mile  precipice it fingered and wrenched  away at groaning ice-slabs. It  screamed over the top, whirled snow  in a dervish dance around the hollow  there, piled snow into the long furrow  plowed ruler-straight through  streamlined hummocks of snow.\n\n\n The sun glinted on black rock  glazed by ice, chasms and ridges and  bridges of ice. It lit the snow slope  to a frozen glare, penciled black  shadow down the long furrow, and  flashed at the furrow's end on a  thing of metal and plastics, an artifact  thrown down in the dead wilderness.\n\n\n Nothing grew, nothing flew, nothing  walked, nothing talked. But the  thing in the hollow was stirring in  stiff jerks like a snake with its back  broken or a clockwork toy running  down. When the movements stopped,  there was a click and a strange  sound began. Thin, scratchy, inaudible  more than a yard away, weary  but still cocky, there leaked from the  shape in the hollow the sound of a  human voice.\n\n\n \"I've tried my hands and arms  and they seem to work,\" it began.  \"I've wiggled my toes with entire  success. It's well on the cards that  I'm all in one piece and not broken  up at all, though I don't see how it  could happen. Right now I don't  feel like struggling up and finding  out. I'm fine where I am. I'll just lie  here for a while and relax, and get  some of the story on tape. This suit's  got a built-in recorder, I might as  well use it. That way even if I'm not  as well as I feel, I'll leave a message.  You probably know we're back  and wonder what went wrong.\n\n\n \"I suppose I'm in a state of shock.  That's why I can't seem to get up.  Who wouldn't be shocked after luck  like that?\n\n\n \"I've always been lucky, I guess.  Luck got me a place in the Whale .  Sure I'm a good astronomer but so  are lots of other guys. If I were ten  years older, it would have been an  honor, being picked for the first long  jump in the first starship ever. At my  age it was luck.\n\n\n \"You'll want to know if the ship  worked. Well, she did. Went like a  bomb. We got lined up between  Earth and Mars, you'll remember,  and James pushed the button marked  'Jump'. Took his finger off the button  and there we were: Alpha Centauri .  Two months later your time,  one second later by us. We covered  our whole survey assignment like  that, smooth as a pint of old and  mild which right now I could certainly  use. Better yet would be a pint  of hot black coffee with sugar in.  Failing that, I could even go for a  long drink of cold water. There was  never anything wrong with the Whale till right at the end and even then I  doubt if it was the ship itself that  fouled things up.\n\n\n \"That was some survey assignment.  We astronomers really lived.  Wait till you see\u2014but of course you  won't. I could weep when I think of  those miles of lovely color film, all  gone up in smoke. \"I'm shocked all right. I never said  who I was. Matt Hennessy, from Farside  Observatory, back of the Moon,  just back from a proving flight cum astronomical survey in the starship Whale . Whoever you are who finds  this tape, you're made. Take it to  any radio station or newspaper office.  You'll find you can name your price  and don't take any wooden nickels.\n\n\n \"Where had I got to? I'd told you  how we happened to find Chang,  hadn't I? That's what the natives called  it. Walking, talking natives on a  blue sky planet with 1.1 g gravity  and a twenty per cent oxygen atmosphere  at fifteen p.s.i. The odds  against finding Chang on a six-sun  survey on the first star jump ever  must be up in the googols. We certainly  were lucky.\n\n\n \"The Chang natives aren't very  technical\u2014haven't got space travel  for instance. They're good astronomers,  though. We were able to show  them our sun, in their telescopes. In  their way, they're a highly civilized  people. Look more like cats than  people, but they're people all right.  If you doubt it, chew these facts  over.\n\n\n \"One, they learned our language  in four weeks. When I say they, I  mean a ten-man team of them.\n\n\n \"Two, they brew a near-beer that's  a lot nearer than the canned stuff we  had aboard the Whale .\n\n\n \"Three, they've a great sense of  humor. Ran rather to silly practical  jokes, but still. Can't say I care for  that hot-foot and belly-laugh stuff  myself, but tastes differ.\n\n\n \"Four, the ten-man language team  also learned chess and table tennis.\n\n\n \"But why go on? People who talk  English, drink beer, like jokes and  beat me at chess or table-tennis are  people for my money, even if they  look like tigers in trousers.\n\n\n \"It was funny the way they won  all the time at table tennis. They certainly  weren't so hot at it. Maybe  that ten per cent extra gravity put us  off our strokes. As for chess, Svendlov  was our champion. He won  sometimes. The rest of us seemed to  lose whichever Chingsi we played.  There again it wasn't so much that  they were good. How could they be,  in the time? It was more that we all  seemed to make silly mistakes when  we played them and that's fatal in  chess. Of course it's a screwy situation,  playing chess with something  that grows its own fur coat, has yellow  eyes an inch and a half long  and long white whiskers. Could you have kept your mind on the game?\n\n\n \"And don't think I fell victim to  their feline charm. The children were  pets, but you didn't feel like patting  the adults on their big grinning  heads. Personally I didn't like the one  I knew best. He was called\u2014well, we  called him Charley, and he was the  ethnologist, ambassador, contact man,  or whatever you like to call him, who  came back with us. Why I disliked  him was because he was always trying  to get the edge on you. All the  time he had to be top. Great sense  of humor, of course. I nearly broke  my neck on that butter-slide he fixed  up in the metal alleyway to the Whale's engine room. Charley laughed  fit to bust, everyone laughed, I  even laughed myself though doing it  hurt me more than the tumble had.  Yes, life and soul of the party, old  Charley ...\n\n\n \"My last sight of the Minnow was  a cabin full of dead and dying men,  the sweetish stink of burned flesh  and the choking reek of scorching insulation,  the boat jolting and shuddering  and beginning to break up,  and in the middle of the flames, still  unhurt, was Charley. He was laughing ...\n\n\n \"My God, it's dark out here. Wonder  how high I am. Must be all of  fifty miles, and doing eight hundred  miles an hour at least. I'll be doing  more than that when I land. What's  final velocity for a fifty-mile fall?  Same as a fifty thousand mile fall, I  suppose; same as escape; twenty-four  thousand miles an hour. I'll make a  mess ... \"That's better. Why didn't I close  my eyes before? Those star streaks  made me dizzy. I'll make a nice  shooting star when I hit air. Come to  think of it, I must be deep in air  now. Let's take a look.\n\n\n \"It's getting lighter. Look at those  peaks down there! Like great knives.  I don't seem to be falling as fast as  I expected though. Almost seem to be  floating. Let's switch on the radio  and tell the world hello. Hello, earth  ... hello, again ... and good-by ...\n\n\n \"Sorry about that. I passed out. I  don't know what I said, if anything,  and the suit recorder has no playback  or eraser. What must have happened  is that the suit ran out of  oxygen, and I lost consciousness due  to anoxia. I dreamed I switched on  the radio, but I actually switched on  the emergency tank, thank the Lord,  and that brought me round.\n\n\n \"Come to think of it, why not  crack the suit and breath fresh air  instead of bottled?\n\n\n \"No. I'd have to get up to do that.  I think I'll just lie here a little bit  longer and get properly rested up  before I try anything big like standing  up.\n\n\n \"I was telling about the return  journey, wasn't I? The long jump  back home, which should have dumped  us between the orbits of Earth  and Mars. Instead of which, when  James took his finger off the button,  the mass-detector showed nothing  except the noise-level of the universe.\n\n\n \"We were out in that no place for  a day. We astronomers had to establish  our exact position relative to the  solar system. The crew had to find  out exactly what went wrong. The  physicists had to make mystic passes  in front of meters and mutter about  residual folds in stress-free space.  Our task was easy, because we were  about half a light-year from the sun.  The crew's job was also easy: they  found what went wrong in less than  half an hour.\n\n\n \"It still seems incredible. To program  the ship for a star-jump, you  merely told it where you were and  where you wanted to go. In practical  terms, that entailed first a series of  exact measurements which had to be  translated into the somewhat abstruse  co-ordinate system we used based on  the topological order of mass-points  in the galaxy. Then you cut a tape on  the computer and hit the button.  Nothing was wrong with the computer.  Nothing was wrong with the  engines. We'd hit the right button  and we'd gone to the place we'd aimed  for. All we'd done was aim for  the wrong place. It hurts me to tell  you this and I'm just attached personnel  with no space-flight tradition. In  practical terms, one highly trained  crew member had punched a wrong  pattern of holes on the tape. Another  equally skilled had failed to notice  this when reading back. A childish  error, highly improbable; twice repeated,  thus squaring the improbability.  Incredible, but that's what  happened.\n\n\n \"Anyway, we took good care with  the next lot of measurements. That's  why we were out there so long. They  were cross-checked about five times.  I got sick so I climbed into a spacesuit  and went outside and took some  photographs of the Sun which I hoped  would help to determine hydrogen  density in the outer regions. When  I got back everything was ready. We  disposed ourselves about the control  room and relaxed for all we were  worth. We were all praying that this  time nothing would go wrong, and  all looking forward to seeing Earth  again after four months subjective  time away, except for Charley, who  was still chuckling and shaking his  head, and Captain James who was  glaring at Charley and obviously  wishing human dignity permitted him  to tear Charley limb from limb. Then  James pressed the button.\n\n\n \"Everything twanged like a bowstring.  I felt myself turned inside out,  passed through a small sieve, and  poured back into shape. The entire  bow wall-screen was full of Earth.  Something was wrong all right, and  this time it was much, much worse.  We'd come out of the jump about  two hundred miles above the Pacific,  pointed straight down, traveling at a  relative speed of about two thousand  miles an hour.\n\n\n \"It was a fantastic situation. Here  was the Whale , the most powerful  ship ever built, which could cover  fifty light-years in a subjective time  of one second, and it was helpless.  For, as of course you know, the  star-drive couldn't be used again for  at least two hours.\n\n\n \"The Whale also had ion rockets  of course, the standard deuterium-fusion  thing with direct conversion.  As again you know, this is good for  interplanetary flight because you can  run it continuously and it has extremely  high exhaust velocity. But in  our situation it was no good because  it has rather a low thrust. It would  have taken more time than we had to  deflect us enough to avoid a smash.  We had five minutes to abandon  ship.\n\n\n \"James got us all into the Minnow at a dead run. There was no time to  take anything at all except the clothes  we stood in. The Minnow was meant  for short heavy hops to planets or  asteroids. In addition to the ion drive  it had emergency atomic rockets,  using steam for reaction mass. We  thanked God for that when Cazamian  canceled our downwards velocity  with them in a few seconds. We  curved away up over China and from  about fifty miles high we saw the Whale hit the Pacific. Six hundred  tons of mass at well over two thousand  miles an hour make an almighty  splash. By now you'll have divers  down, but I doubt they'll salvage  much you can use.\n\n\n \"I wonder why James went down  with the ship, as the saying is? Not  that it made any difference. It must  have broken his heart to know that  his lovely ship was getting the chopper.  Or did he suspect another human  error?\n\n\n \"We didn't have time to think  about that, or even to get the radio  working. The steam rockets blew  up. Poor Cazamian was burnt to a  crisp. Only thing that saved me was  the spacesuit I was still wearing. I  snapped the face plate down because  the cabin was filling with fumes. I  saw Charley coming out of the toilet\u2014that's  how he'd escaped\u2014and I  saw him beginning to laugh. Then  the port side collapsed and I fell out.\n\n\n \"I saw the launch spinning away,  glowing red against a purplish black  sky. I tumbled head over heels towards  the huge curved shield of  earth fifty miles below. I shut my  eyes and that's about all I remember.  I don't see how any of us could have  survived. I think we're all dead.\n\n\n \"I'll have to get up and crack this  suit and let some air in. But I can't.  I fell fifty miles without a parachute.  I'm dead so I can't stand up.\" There was silence for a while except  for the vicious howl of the wind.  Then snow began to shift on the  ledge. A man crawled stiffly out and  came shakily to his feet. He moved  slowly around for some time. After  about two hours he returned to the  hollow, squatted down and switched  on the recorder. The voice began  again, considerably wearier.\n\n\n \"Hello there. I'm in the bleakest  wilderness I've ever seen. This place  makes the moon look cozy. There's  precipice around me every way but  one and that's up. So it's up I'll have  to go till I find a way to go down.  I've been chewing snow to quench  my thirst but I could eat a horse. I  picked up a short-wave broadcast on  my suit but couldn't understand a  word. Not English, not French, and  there I stick. Listened to it for fifteen  minutes just to hear a human voice  again. I haven't much hope of reaching  anyone with my five milliwatt  suit transmitter but I'll keep trying.\n\n\n \"Just before I start the climb there  are two things I want to get on tape.  The first is how I got here. I've remembered  something from my military  training, when I did some parachute  jumps. Terminal velocity for a  human body falling through air is  about one hundred twenty m.p.h.  Falling fifty miles is no worse than  falling five hundred feet. You'd be  lucky to live through a five hundred  foot fall, true, but I've been lucky.  The suit is bulky but light and probably  slowed my fall. I hit a sixty mile  an hour updraft this side of the  mountain, skidded downhill through  about half a mile of snow and fetched  up in a drift. The suit is part  worn but still operational. I'm fine.\n\n\n \"The second thing I want to say is  about the Chingsi, and here it is:  watch out for them. Those jokers are  dangerous. I'm not telling how because  I've got a scientific reputation  to watch. You'll have to figure it out  for yourselves. Here are the clues: (1) The Chingsi talk and laugh but  after all they aren't human. On  an alien world a hundred light-years  away, why shouldn't alien  talents develop? A talent that's  so uncertain and rudimentary  here that most people don't believe  it, might be highly developed  out there. (2) The Whale expedition did fine  till it found Chang. Then it hit  a seam of bad luck. Real stinking  bad luck that went on and  on till it looks fishy. We lost  the ship, we lost the launch, all  but one of us lost our lives. We  couldn't even win a game of  ping-pong.\n\n\n \"So what is luck, good or bad?  Scientifically speaking, future chance  events are by definition chance. They  can turn out favorable or not. When  a preponderance of chance events has  occurred unfavorably, you've got bad  luck. It's a fancy name for a lot of  chance results that didn't go your  way. But the gambler defines it differently.  For him, luck refers to the  future, and you've got bad luck when  future chance events won't go your  way. Scientific investigations into this  have been inconclusive, but everyone  knows that some people are lucky and  others aren't. All we've got are hints  and glimmers, the fumbling touch of  a rudimentary talent. There's the evil  eye legend and the Jonah, bad luck  bringers. Superstition? Maybe; but  ask the insurance companies about  accident prones. What's in a name?  Call a man unlucky and you're superstitious.  Call him accident prone and  that's sound business sense. I've said  enough.\n\n\n \"All the same, search the space-flight  records, talk to the actuaries.  When a ship is working perfectly  and is operated by a hand-picked  crew of highly trained men in perfect  condition, how often is it wrecked  by a series of silly errors happening  one after another in defiance of  probability?\n\n\n \"I'll sign off with two thoughts,  one depressing and one cheering. A  single Chingsi wrecked our ship and  our launch. What could a whole  planetful of them do?\n\n\n \"On the other hand, a talent that  manipulates chance events is bound  to be chancy. No matter how highly  developed it can't be surefire. The  proof is that I've survived to tell the  tale.\" At twenty below zero and fifty  miles an hour the wind ravaged the  mountain. Peering through his polarized  vizor at the white waste and the  snow-filled air howling over it, sliding  and stumbling with every step  on a slope that got gradually steeper  and seemed to go on forever, Matt  Hennessy began to inch his way up  the north face of Mount Everest.

When I say they, I  mean a ten-man team of them.\n\n\n \"Two, they brew a near-beer that's  a lot nearer than the canned stuff we  had aboard the Whale .\n\n\n \"Three, they've a great sense of  humor. Ran rather to silly practical  jokes, but still. Can't say I care for  that hot-foot and belly-laugh stuff  myself, but tastes differ.\n\n\n \"Four, the ten-man language team  also learned chess and table tennis.\n\n\n \"But why go on? People who talk  English, drink beer, like jokes and  beat me at chess or table-tennis are  people for my money, even if they  look like tigers in trousers.\n\n\n \"It was funny the way they won  all the time at table tennis. They certainly  weren't so hot at it. Maybe  that ten per cent extra gravity put us  off our strokes. As for chess, Svendlov  was our champion. He won  sometimes. The rest of us seemed to  lose whichever Chingsi we played.  There again it wasn't so much that  they were good. How could they be,  in the time? It was more that we all  seemed to make silly mistakes when  we played them and that's fatal in  chess. Of course it's a screwy situation,  playing chess with something  that grows its own fur coat, has yellow  eyes an inch and a half long  and long white whiskers. Could you have kept your mind on the game?\n\n\n \"And don't think I fell victim to  their feline charm. The children were  pets, but you didn't feel like patting  the adults on their big grinning  heads. Personally I didn't like the one  I knew best. He was called\u2014well, we  called him Charley, and he was the  ethnologist, ambassador, contact man,  or whatever you like to call him, who  came back with us. Why I disliked  him was because he was always trying  to get the edge on you. All the  time he had to be top. Great sense  of humor, of course. I nearly broke  my neck on that butter-slide he fixed  up in the metal alleyway to the Whale's engine room. Charley laughed  fit to bust, everyone laughed, I  even laughed myself though doing it  hurt me more than the tumble had.  Yes, life and soul of the party, old  Charley ...\n\n\n \"My last sight of the Minnow was  a cabin full of dead and dying men,  the sweetish stink of burned flesh  and the choking reek of scorching insulation,  the boat jolting and shuddering  and beginning to break up,  and in the middle of the flames, still  unhurt, was Charley. He was laughing ...\n\n\n \"My God, it's dark out here. Wonder  how high I am. Must be all of  fifty miles, and doing eight hundred  miles an hour at least. I'll be doing  more than that when I land. What's  final velocity for a fifty-mile fall?  Same as a fifty thousand mile fall, I  suppose; same as escape; twenty-four  thousand miles an hour. I'll make a  mess ... \"That's better. Why didn't I close  my eyes before? Those star streaks  made me dizzy. I'll make a nice  shooting star when I hit air. Come to  think of it, I must be deep in air  now. Let's take a look.\n\n\n \"It's getting lighter. Look at those  peaks down there! Like great knives.  I don't seem to be falling as fast as  I expected though. Almost seem to be  floating. Let's switch on the radio  and tell the world hello. Hello, earth  ... hello, again ... and good-by ...\n\n\n \"Sorry about that. I passed out. I  don't know what I said, if anything,  and the suit recorder has no playback  or eraser. What must have happened  is that the suit ran out of  oxygen, and I lost consciousness due  to anoxia. I dreamed I switched on  the radio, but I actually switched on  the emergency tank, thank the Lord,  and that brought me round.\n\n\n \"Come to think of it, why not  crack the suit and breath fresh air  instead of bottled?\n\n\n \"No. I'd have to get up to do that.  I think I'll just lie here a little bit  longer and get properly rested up  before I try anything big like standing  up.\n\n\n \"I was telling about the return  journey, wasn't I? The long jump  back home, which should have dumped  us between the orbits of Earth  and Mars. Instead of which, when  James took his finger off the button,  the mass-detector showed nothing  except the noise-level of the universe.\n\n\n \"We were out in that no place for  a day. We astronomers had to establish  our exact position relative to the  solar system. The crew had to find  out exactly what went wrong. The  physicists had to make mystic passes  in front of meters and mutter about  residual folds in stress-free space.  Our task was easy, because we were  about half a light-year from the sun.  The crew's job was also easy: they  found what went wrong in less than  half an hour.\n\n\n \"It still seems incredible. To program  the ship for a star-jump, you  merely told it where you were and  where you wanted to go. In practical  terms, that entailed first a series of  exact measurements which had to be  translated into the somewhat abstruse  co-ordinate system we used based on  the topological order of mass-points  in the galaxy. Then you cut a tape on  the computer and hit the button.  Nothing was wrong with the computer.  Nothing was wrong with the  engines. We'd hit the right button  and we'd gone to the place we'd aimed  for. All we'd done was aim for  the wrong place. It hurts me to tell  you this and I'm just attached personnel  with no space-flight tradition. In  practical terms, one highly trained  crew member had punched a wrong  pattern of holes on the tape. Another  equally skilled had failed to notice  this when reading back. A childish  error, highly improbable; twice repeated,  thus squaring the improbability.  Incredible, but that's what  happened.\n\n\n \"Anyway, we took good care with  the next lot of measurements. That's  why we were out there so long. They  were cross-checked about five times.  I got sick so I climbed into a spacesuit  and went outside and took some  photographs of the Sun which I hoped  would help to determine hydrogen  density in the outer regions. When  I got back everything was ready. We  disposed ourselves about the control  room and relaxed for all we were  worth. We were all praying that this  time nothing would go wrong, and  all looking forward to seeing Earth  again after four months subjective  time away, except for Charley, who  was still chuckling and shaking his  head, and Captain James who was  glaring at Charley and obviously  wishing human dignity permitted him  to tear Charley limb from limb. Then  James pressed the button.\n\n\n \"Everything twanged like a bowstring.  I felt myself turned inside out,  passed through a small sieve, and  poured back into shape. The entire  bow wall-screen was full of Earth.  Something was wrong all right, and  this time it was much, much worse.  We'd come out of the jump about  two hundred miles above the Pacific,  pointed straight down, traveling at a  relative speed of about two thousand  miles an hour.\n\n\n \"It was a fantastic situation. Here  was the Whale , the most powerful  ship ever built, which could cover  fifty light-years in a subjective time  of one second, and it was helpless.  For, as of course you know, the  star-drive couldn't be used again for  at least two hours.\n\n\n \"The Whale also had ion rockets  of course, the standard deuterium-fusion  thing with direct conversion.  As again you know, this is good for  interplanetary flight because you can  run it continuously and it has extremely  high exhaust velocity. But in  our situation it was no good because  it has rather a low thrust. It would  have taken more time than we had to  deflect us enough to avoid a smash.  We had five minutes to abandon  ship.\n\n\n \"James got us all into the Minnow at a dead run. There was no time to  take anything at all except the clothes  we stood in. The Minnow was meant  for short heavy hops to planets or  asteroids. In addition to the ion drive  it had emergency atomic rockets,  using steam for reaction mass. We  thanked God for that when Cazamian  canceled our downwards velocity  with them in a few seconds. We  curved away up over China and from  about fifty miles high we saw the Whale hit the Pacific. Six hundred  tons of mass at well over two thousand  miles an hour make an almighty  splash. By now you'll have divers  down, but I doubt they'll salvage  much you can use.\n\n\n \"I wonder why James went down  with the ship, as the saying is? Not  that it made any difference. It must  have broken his heart to know that  his lovely ship was getting the chopper.  Or did he suspect another human  error?\n\n\n \"We didn't have time to think  about that, or even to get the radio  working. The steam rockets blew  up. Poor Cazamian was burnt to a  crisp. Only thing that saved me was  the spacesuit I was still wearing. I  snapped the face plate down because  the cabin was filling with fumes. I  saw Charley coming out of the toilet\u2014that's  how he'd escaped\u2014and I  saw him beginning to laugh. Then  the port side collapsed and I fell out.\n\n\n \"I saw the launch spinning away,  glowing red against a purplish black  sky. I tumbled head over heels towards  the huge curved shield of  earth fifty miles below. I shut my  eyes and that's about all I remember.  I don't see how any of us could have  survived. I think we're all dead.\n\n\n \"I'll have to get up and crack this  suit and let some air in. But I can't.  I fell fifty miles without a parachute.  I'm dead so I can't stand up.\" There was silence for a while except  for the vicious howl of the wind.  Then snow began to shift on the  ledge. A man crawled stiffly out and  came shakily to his feet. He moved  slowly around for some time. After  about two hours he returned to the  hollow, squatted down and switched  on the recorder. The voice began  again, considerably wearier.\n\n\n \"Hello there. I'm in the bleakest  wilderness I've ever seen. This place  makes the moon look cozy. There's  precipice around me every way but  one and that's up. So it's up I'll have  to go till I find a way to go down.  I've been chewing snow to quench  my thirst but I could eat a horse. I  picked up a short-wave broadcast on  my suit but couldn't understand a  word. Not English, not French, and  there I stick. Listened to it for fifteen  minutes just to hear a human voice  again. I haven't much hope of reaching  anyone with my five milliwatt  suit transmitter but I'll keep trying.\n\n\n \"Just before I start the climb there  are two things I want to get on tape.  The first is how I got here. I've remembered  something from my military  training, when I did some parachute  jumps. Terminal velocity for a  human body falling through air is  about one hundred twenty m.p.h.  Falling fifty miles is no worse than  falling five hundred feet. You'd be  lucky to live through a five hundred  foot fall, true, but I've been lucky.  The suit is bulky but light and probably  slowed my fall. I hit a sixty mile  an hour updraft this side of the  mountain, skidded downhill through  about half a mile of snow and fetched  up in a drift. The suit is part  worn but still operational. I'm fine.\n\n\n \"The second thing I want to say is  about the Chingsi, and here it is:  watch out for them. Those jokers are  dangerous. I'm not telling how because  I've got a scientific reputation  to watch. You'll have to figure it out  for yourselves. Here are the clues: (1) The Chingsi talk and laugh but  after all they aren't human. On  an alien world a hundred light-years  away, why shouldn't alien  talents develop? A talent that's  so uncertain and rudimentary  here that most people don't believe  it, might be highly developed  out there. (2) The Whale expedition did fine  till it found Chang. Then it hit  a seam of bad luck. Real stinking  bad luck that went on and  on till it looks fishy. We lost  the ship, we lost the launch, all  but one of us lost our lives. We  couldn't even win a game of  ping-pong.\n\n\n \"So what is luck, good or bad?  Scientifically speaking, future chance  events are by definition chance. They  can turn out favorable or not. When  a preponderance of chance events has  occurred unfavorably, you've got bad  luck. It's a fancy name for a lot of  chance results that didn't go your  way. But the gambler defines it differently.  For him, luck refers to the  future, and you've got bad luck when  future chance events won't go your  way. Scientific investigations into this  have been inconclusive, but everyone  knows that some people are lucky and  others aren't. All we've got are hints  and glimmers, the fumbling touch of  a rudimentary talent. There's the evil  eye legend and the Jonah, bad luck  bringers. Superstition? Maybe; but  ask the insurance companies about  accident prones. What's in a name?  Call a man unlucky and you're superstitious.  Call him accident prone and  that's sound business sense. I've said  enough.\n\n\n \"All the same, search the space-flight  records, talk to the actuaries.  When a ship is working perfectly  and is operated by a hand-picked  crew of highly trained men in perfect  condition, how often is it wrecked  by a series of silly errors happening  one after another in defiance of  probability?\n\n\n \"I'll sign off with two thoughts,  one depressing and one cheering. A  single Chingsi wrecked our ship and  our launch. What could a whole  planetful of them do?\n\n\n \"On the other hand, a talent that  manipulates chance events is bound  to be chancy. No matter how highly  developed it can't be surefire. The  proof is that I've survived to tell the  tale.\" At twenty below zero and fifty  miles an hour the wind ravaged the  mountain. Peering through his polarized  vizor at the white waste and the  snow-filled air howling over it, sliding  and stumbling with every step  on a slope that got gradually steeper  and seemed to go on forever, Matt  Hennessy began to inch his way up  the north face of Mount Everest.

Illustrated by Schoenherr The  wind howled out of  the northwest, blind  with snow and barbed  with ice crystals. All  the way up the half-mile  precipice it fingered and wrenched  away at groaning ice-slabs. It  screamed over the top, whirled snow  in a dervish dance around the hollow  there, piled snow into the long furrow  plowed ruler-straight through  streamlined hummocks of snow.\n\n\n The sun glinted on black rock  glazed by ice, chasms and ridges and  bridges of ice. It lit the snow slope  to a frozen glare, penciled black  shadow down the long furrow, and  flashed at the furrow's end on a  thing of metal and plastics, an artifact  thrown down in the dead wilderness.\n\n\n Nothing grew, nothing flew, nothing  walked, nothing talked. But the  thing in the hollow was stirring in  stiff jerks like a snake with its back  broken or a clockwork toy running  down. When the movements stopped,  there was a click and a strange  sound began. Thin, scratchy, inaudible  more than a yard away, weary  but still cocky, there leaked from the  shape in the hollow the sound of a  human voice.\n\n\n \"I've tried my hands and arms  and they seem to work,\" it began.  \"I've wiggled my toes with entire  success. It's well on the cards that  I'm all in one piece and not broken  up at all, though I don't see how it  could happen. Right now I don't  feel like struggling up and finding  out. I'm fine where I am. I'll just lie  here for a while and relax, and get  some of the story on tape. This suit's  got a built-in recorder, I might as  well use it. That way even if I'm not  as well as I feel, I'll leave a message.  You probably know we're back  and wonder what went wrong.\n\n\n \"I suppose I'm in a state of shock.  That's why I can't seem to get up.  Who wouldn't be shocked after luck  like that?\n\n\n \"I've always been lucky, I guess.  Luck got me a place in the Whale .  Sure I'm a good astronomer but so  are lots of other guys. If I were ten  years older, it would have been an  honor, being picked for the first long  jump in the first starship ever. At my  age it was luck.\n\n\n \"You'll want to know if the ship  worked. Well, she did. Went like a  bomb. We got lined up between  Earth and Mars, you'll remember,  and James pushed the button marked  'Jump'. Took his finger off the button  and there we were: Alpha Centauri .  Two months later your time,  one second later by us. We covered  our whole survey assignment like  that, smooth as a pint of old and  mild which right now I could certainly  use. Better yet would be a pint  of hot black coffee with sugar in.  Failing that, I could even go for a  long drink of cold water. There was  never anything wrong with the Whale till right at the end and even then I  doubt if it was the ship itself that  fouled things up.\n\n\n \"That was some survey assignment.  We astronomers really lived.  Wait till you see\u2014but of course you  won't. I could weep when I think of  those miles of lovely color film, all  gone up in smoke. \"I'm shocked all right. I never said  who I was. Matt Hennessy, from Farside  Observatory, back of the Moon,  just back from a proving flight cum astronomical survey in the starship Whale . Whoever you are who finds  this tape, you're made. Take it to  any radio station or newspaper office.  You'll find you can name your price  and don't take any wooden nickels.\n\n\n \"Where had I got to? I'd told you  how we happened to find Chang,  hadn't I? That's what the natives called  it. Walking, talking natives on a  blue sky planet with 1.1 g gravity  and a twenty per cent oxygen atmosphere  at fifteen p.s.i. The odds  against finding Chang on a six-sun  survey on the first star jump ever  must be up in the googols. We certainly  were lucky.\n\n\n \"The Chang natives aren't very  technical\u2014haven't got space travel  for instance. They're good astronomers,  though. We were able to show  them our sun, in their telescopes. In  their way, they're a highly civilized  people. Look more like cats than  people, but they're people all right.  If you doubt it, chew these facts  over.\n\n\n \"One, they learned our language  in four weeks. When I say they, I  mean a ten-man team of them.\n\n\n \"Two, they brew a near-beer that's  a lot nearer than the canned stuff we  had aboard the Whale .\n\n\n \"Three, they've a great sense of  humor. Ran rather to silly practical  jokes, but still. Can't say I care for  that hot-foot and belly-laugh stuff  myself, but tastes differ.\n\n\n \"Four, the ten-man language team  also learned chess and table tennis.\n\n\n \"But why go on?

Only thing that saved me was  the spacesuit I was still wearing. I  snapped the face plate down because  the cabin was filling with fumes. I  saw Charley coming out of the toilet\u2014that's  how he'd escaped\u2014and I  saw him beginning to laugh. Then  the port side collapsed and I fell out.\n\n\n \"I saw the launch spinning away,  glowing red against a purplish black  sky. I tumbled head over heels towards  the huge curved shield of  earth fifty miles below. I shut my  eyes and that's about all I remember.  I don't see how any of us could have  survived. I think we're all dead.\n\n\n \"I'll have to get up and crack this  suit and let some air in. But I can't.  I fell fifty miles without a parachute.  I'm dead so I can't stand up.\" There was silence for a while except  for the vicious howl of the wind.  Then snow began to shift on the  ledge. A man crawled stiffly out and  came shakily to his feet. He moved  slowly around for some time. After  about two hours he returned to the  hollow, squatted down and switched  on the recorder. The voice began  again, considerably wearier.\n\n\n \"Hello there. I'm in the bleakest  wilderness I've ever seen. This place  makes the moon look cozy. There's  precipice around me every way but  one and that's up. So it's up I'll have  to go till I find a way to go down.  I've been chewing snow to quench  my thirst but I could eat a horse. I  picked up a short-wave broadcast on  my suit but couldn't understand a  word. Not English, not French, and  there I stick. Listened to it for fifteen  minutes just to hear a human voice  again. I haven't much hope of reaching  anyone with my five milliwatt  suit transmitter but I'll keep trying.\n\n\n \"Just before I start the climb there  are two things I want to get on tape.  The first is how I got here. I've remembered  something from my military  training, when I did some parachute  jumps. Terminal velocity for a  human body falling through air is  about one hundred twenty m.p.h.  Falling fifty miles is no worse than  falling five hundred feet. You'd be  lucky to live through a five hundred  foot fall, true, but I've been lucky.  The suit is bulky but light and probably  slowed my fall. I hit a sixty mile  an hour updraft this side of the  mountain, skidded downhill through  about half a mile of snow and fetched  up in a drift. The suit is part  worn but still operational. I'm fine.\n\n\n \"The second thing I want to say is  about the Chingsi, and here it is:  watch out for them. Those jokers are  dangerous. I'm not telling how because  I've got a scientific reputation  to watch. You'll have to figure it out  for yourselves. Here are the clues: (1) The Chingsi talk and laugh but  after all they aren't human. On  an alien world a hundred light-years  away, why shouldn't alien  talents develop? A talent that's  so uncertain and rudimentary  here that most people don't believe  it, might be highly developed  out there. (2) The Whale expedition did fine  till it found Chang. Then it hit  a seam of bad luck. Real stinking  bad luck that went on and  on till it looks fishy. We lost  the ship, we lost the launch, all  but one of us lost our lives. We  couldn't even win a game of  ping-pong.\n\n\n \"So what is luck, good or bad?  Scientifically speaking, future chance  events are by definition chance. They  can turn out favorable or not. When  a preponderance of chance events has  occurred unfavorably, you've got bad  luck. It's a fancy name for a lot of  chance results that didn't go your  way. But the gambler defines it differently.  For him, luck refers to the  future, and you've got bad luck when  future chance events won't go your  way. Scientific investigations into this  have been inconclusive, but everyone  knows that some people are lucky and  others aren't. All we've got are hints  and glimmers, the fumbling touch of  a rudimentary talent. There's the evil  eye legend and the Jonah, bad luck  bringers. Superstition? Maybe; but  ask the insurance companies about  accident prones. What's in a name?  Call a man unlucky and you're superstitious.  Call him accident prone and  that's sound business sense. I've said  enough.\n\n\n \"All the same, search the space-flight  records, talk to the actuaries.  When a ship is working perfectly  and is operated by a hand-picked  crew of highly trained men in perfect  condition, how often is it wrecked  by a series of silly errors happening  one after another in defiance of  probability?\n\n\n \"I'll sign off with two thoughts,  one depressing and one cheering. A  single Chingsi wrecked our ship and  our launch. What could a whole  planetful of them do?\n\n\n \"On the other hand, a talent that  manipulates chance events is bound  to be chancy. No matter how highly  developed it can't be surefire. The  proof is that I've survived to tell the  tale.\" At twenty below zero and fifty  miles an hour the wind ravaged the  mountain. Peering through his polarized  vizor at the white waste and the  snow-filled air howling over it, sliding  and stumbling with every step  on a slope that got gradually steeper  and seemed to go on forever, Matt  Hennessy began to inch his way up  the north face of Mount Everest.
